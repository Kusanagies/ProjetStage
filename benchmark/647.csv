"Lithium-ion batteries are the state-of-the-art power sources for portable electronics, power tools and now electrified vehicles.  The Dahn group at Dalhousie is one of the world-leading research groups in the development of new electrode materials for Li-ion batteries.  Li[Ni(1/3)Mn(1/3)Co(1/3)]O2, invented at Dalhousie, is now replacing LiCoO2 as the electrode material of choice in many applications.  Li[Ni(1/3)Mn(1/3)Co(1/3)]O2 was used at a rate of 8000 metric tonnes per year in 2008 as a positive electrode material in Li-ion batteries.



Developing such materials requires precision battery test equipment so that the charge-discharge cycle life, the differential capacity versus potential, the potential versus specific capacity and the discharge rate capability of new electrode materials can be measured.  Our present battery test equipment was purchased in 1991 and has had two computer swaps and three charger channel augmentations (to a total of 160 channels) since then.  Now, the HP8000 workstation that runs the system is no longer supported by HP, the proprietary charger software will only run on the HP operating system and the staff at Moli Energy who built (and repaired as needed over the years) our system are no longer employed there.  A serious system failure in the fall of 2008 took three weeks to repair due to the dispersal of knowledgable personnel.  Another failure like that will mean the end of our system.  Without state of the art battery test equipment, we cannot work.  Our system is unsupported, very old and needs to be urgently replaced.



This application is an urgent request for state-of-the-art battery test equipment.

"Yava Technologies has a large mineral deposit on Cape Breton Island which contains substantial reserves of lead, manganese and other elements.  The ore body is located in porous rock which makes ""in-situ"" mining possible.  In such a process, a suitable leachant, in this case acetic acid, is injected into the ore body and collector pipes located around the injector pipe collect the leachate which now contains dissolved metals as acetates.  There is no traditional mining with all its associated environmental impact.



The goal of the research is to develop a cost-effective and environmentally-acceptable process to produce state-of-the-art LiMn2O4 for the Li-ion battery industry from the leachate produced by the Yava mine.  This material will be compared ""head-to-head"" with LiMn2O4 from the best commercial vendors.  The results and process will be transferred to Yava for scale up and commercialization.



LiMn2O4 is currently produced at the rate of 3500 metric tonnes per year for the Li-ion battery market.  Li-ion cells using LiMn2O4 are used in power tools, electric bikes and are targeted for use in for electrified vehicles.  As an example LG Chemical will use LiMn2O4 in the Li-ion cells it is producing to the Chevy Volt.  The need for LiMn2O4 is increasing rapidly with time.



The Dahn group at Dalhousie University is a world-leader in the development of new materials for Li-ion cells and has the expertise needed to carry out this project in collaboration with Yava personnel.

Oil reserves are dwindling and although coal reserves stretch for several centuries, use of these reserves will contribute irreversibly to global warming and air pollution.  The Sept. 2006 issue of Scientific American was devoted to an analysis of the world's energy future and showed that many technological solutions can play a strong and important role.  Increased efforts on solar and wind energy as well as battery and fuel cell technologies are required. 

   My laboratory is fully engaged in the discovery and study of new materials for advanced batteries and fuel cells.  In the last five years we have created the only facility in Canada for combinatorial and high throughput materials science.  Using this equipment, hundreds of samples with controlled composition can be synthesized and then studied in parallel.  Our 64-electrode combinatorial lithium batteries and 64-electrode fuel cells (both unique in the world) are being used continuously to discover new materials with improved properties and to understand how composition and structure affect performance.  High capacity electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries and fuel cell catalysts that do not contain platinum are among the topics that are under study.   In addition to discovery and invention, our work has a strong fundamental component. In-situ methods using electrochemical cells with appropriate ""windows"" are used to monitor changes to battery electrode materials as a function of state of charge.  Examples are in-situ x-ray diffraction, in-situ small-angle x-ray scattering, in-situ M�ssbauer spectroscopy, and in-situ atomic force microscopy.

"Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) hold promise as power supplies for zero emission vehicles

and as sources of stationary power. Canada has a strong presence in PEMFC research, development and

manufacturing. Nevertheless, there still remain significant barriers to the production and use of low-cost fuel

cells. One of these is the high cost and limited lifetime of noble metal catalysts (primarily Pt) presently used in

the fuel cell. There has been an intense world-wide search for non-noble metal alternatives to Pt over the last

few years, of which we have been a part. Transition-metal-carbon-nitrogen (TM-C-N) materials have been

identified that are promising as replacements for Pt.

This research project focuses on the search for and understanding of non-noble metal catalysts, primarily

TM-C-N, for the PEMFC using the techniques of Combinatorial and High Throughput Materials Science

(CMS) where many different materials are synthesized and tested in a single experiment. Our laboratory has

build up a significant CMS infrastructure using investments from CFI, NSRIT and NSERC. For the last three

years, beginning with virtually no prior experience, under a Strategic Project grant, we have been investigating

non-noble metal catalysts (NNMC) using CMS along with collaborators at 3M and 3M Canada. We are the

first laboratory to produce highly active NNMC as sputtered thin-films. We have developed significant

expertise and understanding of these systems which has been disseminated.

Many questions regarding these catalysts remain, some of which must be answered before commercial

viability is possible. What is the catalytic site? What is the catalytic mechanism? Are the numerous

""different"" TM-C-N NNMC prepared by numerous groups around the world actually one and the same? How

durable are these catalysts - that is will they last long enough for fuel cell applications? Can better NNMC

catalysts be found? This proposal addresses these issues.

"This proposal is focused at fundamental and applied studies of activated carbons which are impregnated with selected chemicals and then used to remove toxic gases from air.  Such materials are used in respirators worn by emergency responders, soldiers, industrial workers and home handy persons, among others.  The collaborating company, 3M Canada Company, manufactures impregnated activated carbon (IAC) and complete respirators from these IAC at its Brockville, Ontario location.  The Dahn laboratory at Dalhousie University has been successfully collaborating with 3M Canada - Brockville since 2001 in two successive three-year CRD grants.



The present application focuses on fundamental and applied studies of IAC.  First, studies to determine the chemical reactions and their extent between impregnants and toxic gases as a function of impregnant loading, activated carbon type and impregnation method will continue.  Second, the development of a ""multigas carbon"", which can remove most conceivable toxicants from air will continue.



Combinatorial Materials Science (CMS) methods will be established to speed the discovery process in the first two projects.  Hundreds of IACs will be prepared in parallel using a solution/suspension handling robot.  The phases present will be determined with a combinatorial screening X-ray diffractometer.  The ability of the arrays of IACs to remove toxicants will also be determined in parallel using gravimetric methods.  To our knowledge, this will be the first time CMS methods will be applied to studies of impregnated activated carbons for respirator use.

"Wood composite products, which include: laminated veneer lumber (LVL), particleboard, medium density fibreboard (MDF) and oriented strand boards (OSB), constitute a major class of wood products widely used in residential housing and various other marketplaces.  Bonding is obviously of essential importance to the integrity and the performance of wood composites.  While it is widely reported in the literature, bonding has been studied predominantly using trial and error approaches.  Future technological advancements and innovations require a better understanding of the bonding mechanisms.  This proposal outlines the current state of knowledge, the key objectives, and the work plan and the deliverables, concerning the development of a physical and mechanical model of bonding for wood composites.","Wood, wood products and paper","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng."

"When sound reaches the ear, tiny electrical pulses propagate through the different auditory centres in the brain, resulting in the sensation of hearing. Although much about this process remains a mystery, by taping electrodes to the scalp we can non-invasively record the electrical activity in these auditory centres. This signal, called the Auditory-Evoked Potential, allows clinicians to diagnose hearing problems and localize their origin in the brain. The sound that clinicians most commonly use for this test is a brief loud click, which has the benefit of being a simple stimulus with a well-defined evoked potential. However, a click does not provide sufficient information to allow assessing the ability to hear speech. As a result, there is increasing interest in developing tests that record the brain's electrical response to speech, or the Speech-Evoked Potential. For example, we have recently shown that the Speech-Evoked Potential closely follows the fine variations in the pitch of a vowel. In fact, this brain signal is so similar to the speech waveform, if it is converted to a sound and played back, it is perceived as intelligible speech. This means that it allows us to ""listen in"" on the internal representation of speech within the brain.



One impediment to progress in this field has been that very long recording times are sometimes required. The proposed research program aims to develop faster methods to detect the Speech-Evoked Potential that are inspired by speech enhancement algorithms developed for noisy communication environments. Experimental and theoretical work will also be done to clarify the basic properties of the response, with a diverse set of speech samples and in different acoustic environments. The knowledge gained is expected to lead to improvements in automatic speech recognition technologies, and will help lay the foundations for developing better diagnostic tests of hearing loss and tools for evaluating hearing aids.

"This research program is directed towards the creation, understanding and application of new methods for organic synthesis. Organic synthesis is the science of building organic (made primarily of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen atoms) molecules. Similar to an architect designing a building and construction workers building it based on that design, synthetic organic chemists design routes to and build organic molecules. Because of the complexity of organic molecules that Nature makes, synthetic organic chemists require new methods (the tools) to build these new molecules. Once these tools are designed, they are tested in the course of a natural product synthesis. Students trained in these techniques traditionally end up working in fields related to the discovery of new medicines and new materials. Society receives many benefits through the efforts of students trained in the field of synthetic organic chemistry.","Advancement of knowledge","Inorganic & Organic Chemistry"

"Microseismic events in underground mines are highly localized, low intensity earthquakes that are produced by shifting rock that is under high stress due to the mining operations.  These events produce short-time duration mechanical waves that propagate outwards through the rock from the source.  Microseismic waves are recorded using data acquisition systems connected to sensor (geophone) arrays located at mine level (generally, 6, 12 or 16 geophones are used).  The recorded signals are processed to estimate the originating location of the event.  This research primarily focuses on improving the signal processing to obtain better location estimates.

     In an underground mining environment, accurately locating microseismic events is an important problem for both mine planning and safety, since microseismic events are indicators of potential unstable areas.  This is especially important in soft rock mines such as potash, which are very large mines with significant planning and safety requirements.  For example, in Saskatchewan there are ten potash mines.  These are approximately one kilometer below the surface, and they are relatively large, up to 20 kilometers by 20 kilometers at maturity.

     The objective of the proposed research is to investigate methods to improve the localization of microseismic events.  The research will focus on using theoretical statistical signal processing tools to develop novel approaches for better localization.  The research is directly applicable to the underground mining industry, which is a significant component of the Canadian economy and will benefit in improved safety and efficiency.

"Canada is world's largest canola oil exporting country. The total production of canola oil in western Canada was 7.6 million tones in 2004-2005, which was well above the ten year average of 6.5 million tones. According to the statistics Canada estimates, Saskatchewan accounts for approximately 38 % of Western Canadian canola production. The Canola Council of Canada has earmarked 100,000 tones of canola oil for industrial applications due to the surplus quantity of canola oil produced. Except for biodiesel, there is as such no major industrial application of canola so far. Also, the major barrier in commercialization of the biodiesel produced from canola oil is its high processing and raw material cost. Chemical modification namely epoxidation, ring-opening and esterification of canola oil produce chemicals of commercial importance that car be used in various domains as plasticizers and stabilizers in halogen-containing polymers, as lubricant, as components in plastics and in urethane foams and, in general, as intermediates for a large number of commodities. The current research proposal focuses on the development of a green and environmentally friendly process based on heterogeneous mesoporous titanium (Ti) containing zeolite catalysts such as MCM-41 and SB A-15 catalysts for the epoxidation of canola oil and preparation of biodegradable lubricant base stock from epoxidized canola oil. Also, in the present work these heterogeneous catalysts can be used for all the related reactions, i.e. epoxidation, ring opening and esterification. The proposed catalysts and process development work will focus on a new process technology for the production of eco-friendly consumer based canola products from canola oil. This will surely benefit the canola oil industry as the proposed process would be a very good outlet for canola. If successful, the proposed process will be applied to other vegetable oils such as soya, rapeseed etc.","Agricultural chemicals (fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides)","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"
"Due to the recent environmental problems caused by excessive use of fossil fuel resources, increased attention

has been given world wide on use of renewable resources such as biomass for the production of alternative

fuels and chemicals. Therefore, the efficient and environmentally friendly technologies that can convert

biomass to valuable liquid fuels and chemicals are needed for mitigation of climate change problems. The

major goal of the proposed research is to develop an integrated process for complete utilization of Canadian

biomass (agricultural waste, forest residue and municipal organic wastes) for the production of either value

added chemicals or fuel gas using supercritical technology. Supercritical fluid extraction emerges as a new

technology for the extraction of various biochemicals, which have advantages over traditional solvent

extraction process by eliminating the polluting organic solvents. Waste biomass will be converted to

fermentable sugars using supercritical water treatment where the reaction process parameters will be optimized

for higher product fermentable sugars selectivity. These sugars will be further converted to bio-ethanol using

various enzymes. Biomass will be also converted to fuel gases such as H2, CO and CH4 by catalytic

gasification of biomass in supercritical water. Bio-oil is not only the promising alternative fuel but also the

source of many chemicals. Another targeted area of present work is the extraction of biophenolic fraction from

bio-oil using supercritical carbon dioxide and then the convertion of the remaining biooils to biochemicals such

as benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) using zeolites. These biophenols and BTX are most promising

alternatives to petro-derived phenols and BTX which find huge market in resin, composite wood and laminate

industry, and chemical industry. Overall the target of the present research is to develop the integrated

environmentally friendly technologies for the utilization of biomass for fuels and chemicals.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Energy"

"In recent years, petroleum industries are facing tremendous challenges due to more stringent environmental regulations coupled with increasing reliance on heavy crude oil sands derived bitumen.  Syncrude Canada Ltd. currently produces 250,000 bbl/day of synthetic crude oil from the oil sand.  The heavy gas oil, which is a major component of this synthetic crude oil contains higher amounts of sulfur ( 4 wt%) and nitrogen ( 0.4 wt. %), which need to be removed to meet specifications of downstream refining processes. Although the removal of sulfur is relatively easy, it is difficult to remove nitrogen from oil sands derived oils with above hydroteating catalyst.  It is well known that the catalytic performance of Ni-Mo hydrotreating catalyst depends on the support used to a certain extent, since. Recently there have been growing interests in the synthesis of new molecular sieves extending the pore diameter to the mesoporous region.  The mesoporous molecular sieves are obtained with various structures and pore diameters that can be controlled over a wide range (1.6-30nm).  These new molecular sieves offer great potential for the shape-selective sensing, adsorption, and catalysis of large species that were limited by the micropores (typically less than 1nm) of zeolites.  The present research proposal aims at the development of highly active Ni-Mo sulfide catalysts supported on high surface area, wide pore M-SBA-15 (M=Ti,Zr), mesoporous carbon and Carbon Nano Horns (CNHs) for hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) of Athabasca bitumen derived heavy gas oil (HGO).  The high surface area, availability of a large variety of pore sizes, variable surface functional groups, easy metal recovery by the burning of the support, reduced coking propensity, and resistance to nitrogen poisoning are expected to increase the activity of the Ni-Mo catalysts.  The use of these supports for NiMo hydrotreating catalyst will facilitate the removal of N and S atoms from the bulky molecules of heavy crude oil.  This will help the participating industry, Syncrude Canada Ltd. to improve the quality of gas oil, which will meet specifications of downstream refining processes.  This research also benefits Canada by efficient utilization of its vast oil resources.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"

"Three centuries ago, the development of calculus laid the foundation for the formalization of physics. Information and computational science is now well-positioned to assist in the creation of an analogous formal framework for reasoning about biological processes in a rigorous way. The long-term goals of the research proposed here fall into the emerging discipline of Natural Computing and will help to lay these formal foundations for biological processes. Moreover, by studying theoretical models based on natural rules, rather than artificial human-generated rules, we open new insights into the very nature of computation itself. In the short-term, we propose two projects:



The genome of the microscopic worm C. elegans has roughly the same number of genes as the human genome; yet, we observe apparently different levels of complexity in these two organisms. One explanation for this dichotomy is that genes can undergo alternative processing events that modify them, allowing a single gene to encode multiple proteins. One such processing event is that of frameshifting during translation. We have modelled frameshift events as a computation and propose to study this model both to uncover the formal properties of frameshifting as well as develop efficient algorithms for detecting, simulating and experimenting with frameshifting in real genomes.



The minimization of free energy in a biochemical system is the primary force driving chemical reactions including complex macromolecular behaviours. Most existing models in Natural Computing have thus far abstracted away from such thermodynamic considerations. We propose to develop a general framework for introducing thermodynamic considerations to formal models, allowing them to reflect more closely the underlying physical system under study and providing a novel model of computation.

"Earth's climate is highly variable on both long and short term time scales. Changes caused by current anthropogenic green house gas emissions are occurring against the backdrop of the poorly understood natural variability of the Earth's climate system. 

 

    The Pacific ocean-atmosphere processes which contribute to the Earth's climate system can be interpreted from studying modern ocean conditions combined with examining ""laminated"" sediment cores from coastal British Columbia. These sediments record variability in ocean, climate and marine ecosystem conditions for the past 12,000 years. This enhanced understanding of our climate system increases our ability to forecast abrupt and extreme changes such as we are now experiencing. Similarly, the nature and frequency of pre-historic major earthquakes along the B.C. coast, can be interpreted from these same laminated sediment records. 



    This application is for funding for shiptime for a research cruise to mid-coast B.C., north of Vancouver Island, to retrieve ocean sediment cores. This research will help reveal the causes, dynamics and critical thresholds of abrupt climate and ocean changes, as well as advance knowledge of the paleo-seismic history of the mid-coast area. This information is better understood for the south coast of B.C. and the Queen Charlotte Islands area. By studying the mid-coast region, we will advance our regional understanding of ocean and climate changes as well as earthquake activity in B.C. This information is vital not only for scientists, but also for planners, policy-makers, businesses and the public in order to minimize their risk under future rapid climate changes and large earthquake events.

"Coastal and Ocean Resources Inc (CORI), a marine geological and environmental consulting company based in Sidney B.C. and Dr. Audrey Dallimore, Royal Roads University, will collaborate to validate and perform the first field ground truthing of a new computerized Nearshore Habitat Mapping Model that CORI has had in product development for the past two years. An understanding of the spatial distribution of nearshore benthic (bottom) habitats in the marine environment is required to: implement ecosystem based fisheries management; assess species distribution and the recovery potential of species reduced from historic abundance; and understand sensitivities of species of interest for fisheries which may be impacted by future industrial development.



The critical nearshore interface between intertidal and deep marine areas (>50 m) represents a problematic zone frequently presented as an unmapped zone or a ""white strip"" on many benthic habitat maps. To address this problem, CORI has been developing a predictive computer modeling technique which combines bathymetric data, existing coastal intertidal habitat classification data, a model of numerical tidal data and spatial modeling techniques to predict the nature of the critical ""white zone"" benthic habitat. The proposed project will undertake a field based ground truthing of the model in the Broughton Archipelago area of the central B.C. coast, to verify the model's predictions. This collaboration will advance our understanding of the largely scientifically unknown nearshore area while developing both a scientifically and also commercially applicable

and cost-effective predictive computer modeling tool for broad application to studies of the nearshore area. This innovative approach will have wide applications for habitat resource managers and nearshore fisheries (e.g., urchin, geoduck fisheries) as well as coastal community planners including First Nation's community fisheries.","Advancement of knowledge","Pacific Internal Decision Committee"
"Earth's climate is highly variable on both long- and short-term time-scales. The Pacific ocean-atmosphere processes which contribute to this variability can be interpreted from a combination of: a) surveys of the modern ocean conditions along coastal British Columbia, and b) ""laminated"" ocean sediment records. These ""paleo"" or ""past"" sediment records extend our knowledge of variations in the natural climate system well beyond the reach of the existing century-long instrument record and help us to understand climate changes which occurred thousands of years ago.  In turn, this enhanced knowledge of our climate system increases our understanding of the rapid climate changes we are now experiencing. Similarly, the nature and frequency of past great earthquakes along the Pacific coast of Canada can be interpreted from these same laminated ocean sediment records.



This research program involves ocean research cruises to obtain oceanographic data and piston cores of laminated ocean sediments along the previously uninvestigated mid and northern B.C. coast. These data and cores will be subsequently analyzed in the laboratory for clues to the functioning of the northern Pacific climate system, both what occurred in the past and what we may expect in the future. The results will contain insights into the causes, dynamics, critical thresholds and past impacts of natural rapid climate changes, as well as seismic activity along the B.C. coast, on time scales of human interest. The conclusions will fill critical knowledge gaps, not only for the understanding of physical sciences researchers studying the Pacific Ocean, but also for planners, policy-makers and the public in order to minimize their future risk under rapid climate changes and possible large earthquake events. An improved understanding of Pacific paleoclimate is also critical for validating global and regional climate models which are currently being used to forecast future climate change.

"Worm parasites, otherwise known as helminths, infect over one third of the world's population. Their survival in the host is due to their ability to manipulate or modulate the host's immune system to their benefit. The present proposal is focused on the mechanisms by which helminth parasites (the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica and the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni which together infect >200 million people worldwide) modulate the immune response of the host to benefit their survival. We have identified a molecule, termed peroxiredoxin, which these parasites liberate into the circulation of the host to influence the host immune system. 

    )	We will investigate the structure of the peroxiredoxin molecule to figure out what part of it interacts with immune cells (macrophages) and makes them change their activity. We will also decipher how macrophages pick up the signal from peroxiredoxin and translate this inside the cell to become functionally altered. Finally, we will investigate how these altered macrophages go on to influence the characteristics of other immune cells (T cells) to downplay inflammatory responses.

             This research will provide an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the means by which helminth parasites control the host immune system, which could lead to important anti-parasite vaccines. However, there are much broader implications as information on how parasites influence inflammatory responses could help us design therapeutic strategies to major human diseases including cancer, inflammatory bowl disease, muscular dystrophy, arthrosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis all of which occur because of excessive inflammatory activity.

"The rational design of new therapies for human malignancies may be achieved by chemically synthesizing analogues of the natural nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).   Several such analogues are being developed in our laboratory; for example, one of much interest to us is a close 'cousin' of RNA:  arabinonucleic acid (ANA), which contains arabinose instead of ribose as its sugar ring.   Other compounds have a ""lasso"" structure, the so-called ""RNA lariats""; these are very curious molecules that form in the nucleus of every eukoryotic cell.     By comparing these structures with respect to their chemical and biological properties that are fundamental to RNA's biological functions, we hope to be able to generate alternative nucleic acid structures that are able to ""silence"" genes that participate in disease progression (cancer, inflammation, etc).   Therefore, a significant component of our research at McGill focuses on the development of nucleic acid ""analogues"" with improved therapeutic potential.   It is our hope that the chemical modified nucleic acids we will develop are generally applicable and can be employed against a wide range of therapeutic gene targets.



The ""gene machine"" (an automated DNA/RNA synthesizer) provided by this research grant allows preparation of many of these nucleic acid analogues simultaneously and at a scale that will permit systematic evaluation of their three-dimensional structure and biological activity.  The instrument, like no other in the market, is capable of making 12 molecules in a single run, at a scale that provides several milligram quantities needed for structural and in vivo studies.   Students (HQP) trained with this instrument will gain new insights into DNA/RNA structure and biology, and develop expertise in synthesis, analytical skills, and strategies to develop candidate molecules into useful drugs.  This expertise will increase their ability to tackle challenging problems and, simultaneously, improve their value to employers in the areas of chemistry and medicinal chemistry.

"Many wireless communication systems employ code division multiple access (CDMA)technology, most notably 3rd generation cellular.  Unfortunately, these systems are not able to meet the demand for wireless services in some markets and new techniques are being developed to improve the amount of data that can be simultaneously transmitted by multiple users over the limited available frequency spectrum.  Many 4th generation proposals call for a completely new technology to be used.  Such a solution requires replacing much of the existing wireless infrastructure.



In this research proposal, we propose improving existing CDMA systems rather than replacing them.  In CDMA all users are assigned a spreading code which is used for signal identification.  However, since all users transmit simultaneously over the same frequency spectrum, tey interfere with one another.  The interference limits the amount of users that can simultaneously transmit.  In our research, we propose using the spreading code for more than just signal separation.  The spreading code will also carry redundant information and act like an error control code without the power loss associated with code rates.  This technique is referred to as data dependent spreading (or coset dependent spreading).  Initial results that we have published show that the technique is more resistant to the interference caused by other users and thus allows more users to access the common channel.  



In previous data dependent spreading research, many simplifying assumptions are made, such as perfect channel gain knowledge at the receiver.  The goal of the proposed research is to examine practical systems employing data dependent spreading.  Thus we need to look at channel estimation techniques, integration of additional coding, reduced complexity receiver algorithms etc.

"Canadian academic researchers, in collaboration with FPInnovations managers and researchers are proposing to

build an NSERC Strategic Research Network on Value Chain Optimization (VCO). In its quest for increased

competitiveness of the Canadian forest products industry, FPInnovations has identified VCO as a key part of its Transformative Technologies program. The NSERC VCO Network aims to provide the industry and policy makers with new advanced planning and decision support systems to design and deploy optimized forest bioeconomy networks. New value propositions are to be evaluated from a global value chain perspective. The decision making processes, from strategic to operational, as well as the implementation processes are to be studied within the NSERC VCO Network. Designs of innovative, agile and integrated logistics and manufacturing systems are also expected.

The urgent mission of the NSERC VCO Network is to improve the Canadian forest industry competitiveness through forest and business innovation by training the best highly qualified personnel in the emerging field of value chain modeling and by providing analysis tools and decision support for optimization of the modern forest bioeconomy networks. By forest bioeconomy network we mean the entire network of activities and processes from the tree through to the consumers of conventional forest products, new value added products, new fibre products and new biochemical and biofuel products. Through its interdisciplinary research program and its unique research environment, the NSERC VCO network will contribute to the well-being of Canadians, its forest sector as well as to world science and engineering knowledge.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","Strategic Network Grants"

"The transition from forest to tundra in arctic and alpine regions - referred to as the 'forest-tundra ecotone' and punctuated by the upper limit of tree growth, known as 'treeline' - is expected to advance significantly as climate warming continues, with serious implications for biodiversity and earth-system processes. Research on the ecological processes that influence its dynamics, as well as responses to past climate change, is critical for improving forecasts of landscape change and understanding its ecological consequences. This program integrates field ecology with geospatial analysis to study the forest-tundra of northwestern Canada at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Research over the next five years will endeavour to answer two thematic questions: (1) How has the forest-tundra responded to climatic change and variability in the past?, and (2) What are the suite of physical and biological variables that influence the establishment and growth of trees and shrubs across the ecotone and, importantly, how do they interact to influence treeline dynamics? Investigations will focus on the altitudinal ecotone of southwest Yukon and the latitudinal ecotone of central Northwest Territories with the ancillary goal of comparing the two types of transitions. Methods and techniques range from plant-level measures of growth and physiology within experimental treatments, community-level investigations of population dynamics and species interactions, and landscape-scale measures of spatial pattern and ecosystem processes using remote sensing and GIS. Interdisciplinary training of students is a significant component of the research program. At least five Master's students and two Ph.D. students will be supported during the grant period and at least two undergraduate students will be hired annually as field and lab assistants. Individual projects are likely to focus on a specific scale and will act as the foundation of student training. The most novel scientific contribution of the program will be the integration of these projects in a hierarchical fashion to elucidate the cross-scale pattern-process relationships that create and shape ecotones and influence their dynamics.",Environment,"Evolution & Ecology"
"The transition from boreal forest to arctic tundra - referred to as the 'forest-tundra ecotone' and punctuated by the upper limit of tree growth, known as 'treeline' - is expected to advance significantly as climate warming continues, with serious implications for biodiversity and earth-system processes. The over-arching goal of my research program is to identify and more thoroughly understand how this will occur in northern Canada and, importantly, what the ecological consequences will be. More accurate forecasts of change will help northern Canadians cope with mounting uncertainty and provide useful knowledge for developing locally relevant adaptation strategies. Research over the next five years will integrate field ecology with geospatial analysis at multiple spatial and temporal scales and endeavour to answer two thematic questions: (1) How has the forest-tundra responded to climatic change in the past?, and (2) What are the suite of physical and biological variables that influence the establishment and growth of trees and shrubs at treeline? Investigations will focus on the southwest Yukon and central Northwest Territories, home to the Southern Tutchone and Dene Peoples. Funding from the Northern Research Supplement will help offset the higher costs associated with conducting fieldwork in these regions. Funds will be used towards (i) the cost of float-plane and helicopter support to access field sites; (iii) annual return transport of the research team and equipment to Whitehorse and Yellowknife; and (iii) the added costs of daily transportation and subsistence in these areas. Communication and collaboration with northern first nations, communities, resource co-management councils, and territorial and federal agencies is an important component of the research program. Recent success has been achieved on these fronts, and these will be expanded during the granting period.

"The parietal cortex subserves a wide range of cortical functions including visuomotor control and corporeal awareness, as well as playing a critical role in maintaining a conscious representation of the world. Work in patients with discrete lesions of this region and more recently, functional neuroimaging research has advanced our knowledge of the role played by the parietal cortex in such things as the control of visually guided hand and eye movements, the direction (and redirection) of visual spatial attention and in the representation of time. Indeed, work in my lab has shown that lesions to the right parietal cortex that cause neglect (a loss of awareness for contralesional events) also lead to a complex array of deficits including poor spatial working memory even for objects and events within ipsilesional space and dramatically impoverished perception of the passage of time for centrally presented events1. Recent fMRI work in my lab demonstrated that the parietal cortex is differentially involved in tasks requiring the subject to determine the centre of objects depending on particular stimulus configurations and the required response. For the current funding period we aim to follow-up on this work to address two broad questions; first, what component deficits are necessary for producing a loss of awareness for contralesional events (i.e., neglect) and in addition what is rehabilitated in patients with neglect following periods of prism adaptation? Second, what is the relationship between the deployment of visual spatial attention and the control of visually guided movements?","Advancement of knowledge","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences"

"The wireless revolution is evident in every aspect of our daily life, from satellite communications to human health. Integration and miniaturization is an obvious next step which pushes technology limits beyond those of conventional ones. Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and nanotechnology provide the opportunity to realize millimeter-wave wireless devices in much smaller size, superior performance and lower cost to satisfy the market demand. This research plan is dedicated to advancing the millimeter-wave MEMS technology for various targets covering from aerospace to biomedical applications. Primary focus of the project will be on developing a new category of MEMS devices that would be called 3D monolithic millimeter-wave MEMS. The idea is based on monolithic integration of MEMS actuators and micro-fabricated waveguide. The concept will be implemented to develop single device as well as integrated circuits and systems for satellite and automotive applications.  The proposed approach promotes a new category of millimeter-wave MEMS devices that offer superior performance with much higher power handling capability compared to the existing MEMS devices. To illustrate the wide application range of the proposed concept, the developed 3D MEMS basic building block will be expanded to a scanning switch network for biomedical dental imaging. This is used to substitute X-ray imaging which is harmful to human body tissue. This research will also investigate on conventional planar MEMS technology. For instance a MEMS switch network will be implemented to change the electrical size of an antenna slightly and generate a phase shift at the far field. This can be used in phased array antenna as a source of phase shifting and avoid external phase shifters which reduces the cost considerately.

"The atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) has been increasing rapidly since the Industrial Revolution and the increase will continue in the foreseeable future. The rising [CO2] will affect the physiology, growth and distribution of plants and ecosystems. Recent studies suggest that the climate change associated with increasing atmospheric [CO2] will be the most prominent in the boreal region. The boreal forest is the largest terrestrial ecosystem on the earth. Its ecophysiological activities can have a profound impact on the environmental conditions of the earth's surface. For example, its photosynthesis is a significant force in the fixation of atmospheric CO2 and the production of oxygen.  The ecophysiological regulation of water flux from the boreal forest to the atmosphere has a major influence on the properties of the lower atmosphere.  The ecophysiological processes are in turn controlled by climate conditions. Black spruce is the most abundant tree species in the boreal forest and its response to the rising [CO2] will exert a major influence to the overall response of the boreal forest to global climate change. Black spruce grows over a wide range of soil temperature, moisture and nutrient conditions. The soil conditions will likely influence the ecophysiological responses of the species to rising [CO2]. However, our understanding of these effects is very limited. This research will conduct a series of controlled experiments to examine how soil temperature, moisture and nutrition interact with each other in influencing the ecophysiological activities of black spruce under current and future atmospheric CO2 concentration. Computer models will be developed describing the responses. These models will provide a critical linkage between tree physiology models and soil models within ecosystem models for studying the response of boreal forests to the global climate change.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","Plant Biology & Food Science"

"There is an increasing need for 3D acquisition and modeling of complex urban and landscape landmarks using simple and low cost technological solutions while offering spatially accurate and precise 3D object information. Terrestrial three-dimensional modeling of objects and scenes is an intensive and long-lasting research problem in the graphics, vision and photogrammetric communities. The requirements specified for many applications, including infrastructure inspection and surveying, involve high geometric accuracy and the modeling of the complete details, as well as the automation, low costs, portability and flexibility of the modeling technique. Different image-based approaches have been proposed to produce accurate and detailed models. However, they remain highly interactive since most of the current automated methods are still unproven in real applications. Consequently, the quality of the result depends on the user expertise. As a result, there is currently no photogrammetric solution dedicated to the expanding non-photogrammetrists user community requesting low cost and high accuracy systems.The long-term objective of the proposed research program consists in designing a comprehensive close range photogrammetry method for the 3D acquisition and modeling of complex objects and scenes. The targeted method will be design under low cost, high accuracy, automation and exhaustiveness constraints. In terrestrial photogrammetry, 3D acquisition and modeling is a two stages process. First (stage 1), it consists in acquiring the images and related positioning data (i.e. GPS and INS data); second (stage 2), it consists in exploiting these images in order to recover 3D object details. The performances of stage 2 are strongly relying on how stage 1 is carried out. Therefore, to meet our long-term objective, we propose to address the following short-term objectives: 1) to develop innovative strategies and methods to efficiently guide the images acquisition process; 2) to design new concepts for 3D modeling methods enhancing the automation of photogrammetric processes and their use by non specialists in geomatics. This research will yield to novel generic concepts, reusable in various computer and industrial vision domains.

"    )	In Alberta, the current management strategy protects riparian forests from disturbance to reduce risk of adversely affecting streams and aquatic ecosystems. However, riparian zones are not immune to natural disturbance, some of which may be vitally important to maintain stream function. For example, the recruitment and retention of logs in riparian zones alters stream geomorphology and hydrology resulting in critical habitat for invertebrates and fish. This study, a collaboration of the Tree-Ring Lab at the University of British Columbia (UBC), Foothills Model Forest (FMF), Hinton Wood Products (West Fraser) and ANC Timber Ltd. (Alberta Newsprint Company (ANC)), will quantify recruitment and decay rates and residence times of large woody debris (LWD) in pine- and spruce-dominated riparian forests, surrounding small first order streams in the upper and lower foothills sub-regions of western Alberta. Three interconnected projects will use multiple lines of evidence to quantify the dynamics of LWD, as follows. (1) Tree-ring analyses will determine the time since death of logs in various stage of decay and in forests of different ages. These results will be used to calculate rates LWD recruitment and develop predictive models of LWD persistence and rates of decay. (2) Tree-ring analysis of snags and logs in permanent sample plots in upland forests will quantify decay processes for terrestrial coarse woody debris. We will use this information to determine the rate of decay and rate of outer ring erosion in order to improve the accuracy of age estimates of LWD. (3) We will develop models to test for differences in decay rates and processes between upland and riparian woody debris. The outcome of this research will have value to both theoretical ecology and applied forest management in the foothills of Alberta and other montane and boreal forests. We will work with the Foothills Model Forest to develop tools for ensure that new knowledge gained from this research is effectively integrated into forest management practices and policy.

"Although fire is a central process driving vegetation dynamics and the evolution of native species, the spatial and temporal variation in fire regimes of the mountain forests of BC is poorly understood. Fire regimes are strongly influenced by climate, fuels and humans. Climate is considered a ""top-down"" driver of fire regimes, influencing conditions conducive to fire at broad spatial scales and at a range of time scales from days to years to decades. Fuel availability and combustibility are ""bottom-up"" controls of fire and are strongly influenced by local topography such as slope aspect and elevation. Moreover, in many dry forest types, fuels have accumulated due to fire exclusion resulting from land use changes followed by fire suppression. The relative importance of top-down and bottom-up controls on fire varies geographically and by forest type, but we need further understanding of specific mechanisms, interactions and human impacts. My long-term scientific objective is to quantify the characteristics (frequency, severity, extent) of different fire regimes in mountain forests and distinguishes the relative importance of climate, fuels and human land use on those regimes. In the short-term, my graduate students and I will use dendroecological (tree-ring) reconstructions to investigate variation in fire history at multiple spatial and temporal scales in submontane (<1100 masl), montane (1100-1600masl) and subalpine (>1600 masl) forests of the southern Rocky Mountain Trench (SRMT).  The objectives of our field-based research are: (1) differentiate the interacting impacts of bottom-up fuels versus top-down climate controls on historic fire frequency/severity and (2) determine the impacts of human land use on these controls. Improved understanding of the mechanisms and controls of fire regimes will allow us to predict of future fire regimes under the influence of global climate change, identify segments of the landscape significantly altered by past land use, and establish priorities and targets for ecological restoration and fuels mitigation in the wildland-urban interface, parks, and protected areas.","Conservation and preservation","Evolution & Ecology"

In the near future, we will study the behaviour of composite structures with integrated piezoelectric composite actuators.

Efforts will be conducted to develop a comprehensive numerical tool that can be used to analyse a structure subjected to thermo-mechanical loads and piezoelectric actuation. Experimental work will be conducted to validate the model predictions.  A methodology will be developed to actively control the shape of structures subjected to thermal loading.  The proposed research activities will contribute to explore and develop new smart structures and systems.  Insights will be gained on the behaviour of combined piezocomposite/laminate structures.

"We are seeing the emergence of new signal processing techniques that combine multiple physiological modalities such as hearing and in vision.  These modalities can be in the form of speech, facial movements, and gestures and used to improve signal processing results and human-computer interaction.  Areas that can take advantage of multimodal processing includes audiovisual speech recognition, audiovisual speech enhancement, audiovisual speaker detection, audiovisual speech separation, audiovisual affect-sensitive recognition (emotion recognition), and gesture-speech recognition for human-computer interaction.



The broader scope of the research program I propose is to develop multimodal techniques for advanced video conferencing.  The initial focus is on single channel audiovisual speech separation and underdetermined multi-channel audiovisual speech separation where one or more microphones are placed within a room to record the speech along with one or more video cameras to record lip motion.  Other aspects such as audiovisual speaker detection and tracking, and audiovisual speech enhancement will also be part of the research.



The problem to address is the ""cocktail party effect"".  Consider that you are at a cocktail party where many smaller groups of people are talking.  Even though we hear other people talking in the room, humans are quite adept at focusing on one particular speaker and ignoring the speech of the other talkers.  The goal of the speech separation is to develop signal processing techniques that can filter out the speech of the other talkers will keeping the speech of just one talker, like in the ""cocktail party effect"".  It is expected that including information about lip motion will improve the speech separation over acoustic-only solutions, which degrade when any room reverberation and high levels of noise exist.","Communications equipment","Electrical and Computer Engineering"

"Aquaculture is a growing source of employment and offers the possibility for social and economic improvements in communities with limited industrial alternatives. Ontario is the major Canadian producer of rainbow trout for human consumption. Even though market demand and consumer acceptability for Ontario trout is very strong, imports of farmed fish products dominate the marketplace. The development of Canadian trout aquaculture is limited by the inability of local producers to supply seedstock to grow-out cages. Production is concentrated within the year because of the restricted spawning time of females. Also, established strains are relatively unimproved for economically important traits such as increased growth rate and the prevention of early maturation. Our long term goal is to provide the molecular genetic information that will expedite the development and availability of rainbow trout strains that are uniquely suited to Canadian

conditions. We are using two approaches to meet this goal. The first involves the application of genomic technologies to the selective breeding of normal and all-female lines to increase growth, reduce early maturation, and increase the yearly spawning times of females. The second involves understanding the genetic interactions that may occur within existing strains through the introduction of new genetic material from outside stocks. The specific objectives will be to increase the size of the genetic linkage map for rainbow trout, determine the co-variation in quantitative trait loci for embryonic developmental rate and early maturation, determine the correlation between female spawning date within a season and QTL for other life-history traits,

evaluate the performance of crosses between domestic and wild strains and within all-female lines using gene expression profiles, and develop gene expression profile arrays on young fish that may be used to predict future performance. This project involves groups from two Canadian universities, the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans and several industrial partners.

"Understanding how genes interact with one another and with their surrounding environment to bring about changes in individuals remains one of the greatest challenges in modern biology.  We are now gaining an understanding of many genes that are important in bringing about developmental change and adaptation to novel environmental situations, yet we still lack precise knowledge on which genes, from many interacting genetic elements, may be the most important determinants of these processes.  We are also a long way from understanding how all the genes in the vertebrate body are organized with respect to one another, and whether the retention of multiple copies of genes are important in adaptation and survival.  Most vertebrate species have descended from ancestors that have undergone at least two whole genome duplications (i.e. doubling of all the genes and chromosomes in their body), while modern bony fishes have descended from an ancestor that experienced one additional whole genome duplication.  It has been suggested that this extra round of genome duplication accounts for why we have many more fish species (~30,000) compared to all other vertebrate classes combined.   Additionally, some fishes (e.g. salmonids such as salmon and trout), have undergone one extra genome duplication (i.e. have undergone 4 rounds of genome duplication).  Genes influencing growth and timing of important life-history traits (e.g. age of sexual maturity and time of seasonal reproduction), are some of the most important genes influencing fish survival in the natural world.  This research seeks to identify the most important genetic elements influencing growth and life-history adaptation traits in salmonid fishes.  This research also seeks to understand how genes are arranged, and retained or lost within the genomes of salmonid fishes.  These species are living testaments to complex genome changes that have occurred in vertebrates, and thus knowledge from this research will further our understanding of vertebrate genome evolution.  Additionally, the study of genetic interactions may help us to understand how new populations form, and whether genetic interactions help promote or inhibit genetic exchange among populations.","Animal management (animal diseases, breeding)","Evolution & Ecology"
"Genetic improvement of production traits remain a top priority for developing and expanding the Canadian

aquaculture industry. Growth related production traits such as fillet yield/quality remain key targets for

improvement in fishes given that rearing costs remain high and are forecast to increase in the future. Fish

farmers can increase profitability substantially if they are able to grow fish with high fillet yield and protein

levels in comparison to fish stocks that are unselected for these traits. Understanding the genomics and

physiology underlying optimum growth in rainbow trout can help achieve these goals, and also ensure a more

uniform and continued production of product. Our long term goal is to provide the molecular genetic

information that will expedite the development and availability of rainbow trout strains that are uniquely suited

to Canadian conditions. The research in this proposal is directed at finding associations between specific

appetite regulating genes and genes known to influence lipid deposition, utilization, and cellular energy states,

to assess whether they are related to optimal fillet yield characteristics in rainbow trout. The first specific

objective will be to increase the size of the rainbow trout genetic linkage map though the mapping of genes

involved in the major physiological pathways that regulate lipid and metabolic flux and those associated with

the appetite response. We will also assess the effects of typical and cyclic feeding regimes on fillet yield and

the expression level of the appetite-related genes and a selection of candidate lipogenic and lypolytic genes.

Associations between variation in candidate genes markers and fillet yield and quality will be used to identify

chromosomal regions and genes responsible for the observed phenotypic variation. Finally, we will search for

similar associations in a commercial setting to yield information that might be applied to selective breeding

programs to increase the rate of genetic improvement. This research will yield insights into genes that are

associated with the growth process and whether alterations in feeding regimes have the potential to yield a

larger and higher quality fillet for human consumption.",Aquaculture,"Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Fishery Industry"

"The aim of this research programme is to study the crust and upper mantle structure of the eastern Canadian Shield. Data from large distant earthquakes will be used to investigate variations in seismic wave speed and upper mantle alignments across the regions of interest. Recent analysis of surface wave propagation across northern and eastern Ontario sheds light on the complex structure of the Canadian Shield, and is paving the way for analysis of past and present structural alignments and mantle flow patterns. A variety of seismic analysis techniques will be applied to regions of Canada whose structure is not yet well known, in order to study 3-D seismic structure at several scales. I intend to lead detailed studies of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt across the Ontario-Quebec border, and to take an active part in collaborative research into the deep structure of Hudson Bay (in conjunction with the Hudson Bay Lithospheric Experiment). Expansion of the POLARIS (Portable Observatories for Lithospheric Analysis and Research Investigating Seismicity) seismograph network throughout Quebec will allow crust and upper mantle studies of the eastern Canadian Shield, resulting in a more complete picture of the seismic structure of the entire Superior Province and its surroundings. The resulting 3-D models will be combined with information from other geophysical disciplines to provide new insights into the tectonic history of eastern and central Canada, and the interaction of the thick continental root with regional and global mantle flow patterns.","Earth sciences","Solid Earth Sciences"

"New techniques for imaging and analysis have been identified as key components of the evolution of diagnosti and therapeutic biomedical technologies. Advances in capabilities like early detection of disease, identification and study of living processes, pharmacology, and treatment contribute directly to the social well being of an aging population, to cost savings in healthcare, and to economic growth in environmentally friendly high-tech industries. In this proposal, we address a new class of imaging and analytical instruments that provide non-invasive and non-ionizing measurement in a small, portable, and low cost form factor. Our scientific focus is on key challenges in the generation, imaging, and detection of electromagnetic signals at Tera-Hertz frequencies, the frequency band between radio and visible light frequencies. Evidence suggests that biomedical analysis at these frequencies can reveal a wealth of new information for medical diagnosis and science.","Biomedical engineering","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Biomedical Technologies"
"Research is centered on critical challenges associated with today's communication networks.

The first involves the inability of modern networks to transport a variety of information formats. Having been designed for efficient wide-area transport of high-speed digital signals, current wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) networks do not support the more fragile channel formats associated with emerging radio-over-fiber systems, cable television, sensor networks, and future digital modulation techniques. Our objective is to create networks in which a far greater diversity of channel formats can be supported.

Second, delay encountered in the Internet impedes emerging real-time applications like on-line music collaboration, remote procedures, gaming, and some forms of networked computing. From our understanding of the various sources of delay, it is apparent that substantial improvements can be realized. In this research, we take an end-to-end view in trying to understand and mitigate network delay, while working with applications researchers to enable new services like online music collaboration.

"Brain imaging is one of the fastest growing areas in science and technology. These advances are making it possible to non-invasively peer deeper into the brain and watch as information is processed and thoughts are formed. With these capabilities come unprecedented opportunities for improving our basic understanding of the brain. This, in turn, allows for the development of new ways to diagnose and treat brain disease and disorders. However, in order to fully realize this potential, it is critical to gain a better understanding of the ""activation"" revealed through brain imaging - a step that is fundamental to learning more about higher mental functions. The current research focuses on advancing our understanding of activation, particularly that which supports higher mental function. The research involves the integration of data from brain scans (using magnetic resonance imaging) and brain waves (using electrical potential and magnetic field recordings). By improving upon current knowledge of the relationship between activation and brain function, the research will lay the foundation for a host of future advances in diagnostic imaging (e.g., surgical brain mapping).

"Energy metabolism is central to all biological functions. In animals, the physiology and biochemistry involved in energy metabolism is based on a conserved blueprint which is adjusted to serve different functions (e.g. among tissues) and wide-ranging performances (e.g. locomotion). I am interested in how physiological systems and biochemical pathways involved in energetics vary among individuals and how they are adjusted over evolutionary time to generate the diversity observed in animal performance. To address these questions, I study the energetics of flight in insects. Insect flight is a good model to study energy metabolism because flight performance varies widely across species and it is the most expensive activity performed by animals. In bees and wasps, the energy requirements of flight muscle cells vary several-fold across species; nevertheless, we do not know the underlying mechanisms that explain this variation. Using various approaches developed to integrate the fields of physiology and evolution, I investigate how characteristics of a species and an individual determine the energy requirements for flight. Another major component of my work studies the cellular basis of energetics diversity. Variation in cellular energy production involves customizing metabolic pathways by changing the properties or quantities of the enzymes that form the pathways. I study the variation of these proteins in flight muscle cells and how it relates to species and individual performance, ultimately connecting this variation with how the involved genes are regulated. Finally, I examine physiologies connected to muscle energy use, namely fuel storage and delivery. The implications of this work are fundamental to our understanding of diversity in animal energetics and how it evolves. My research will provide information on flight performance of pollinators and the variables affecting it.","Advancement of knowledge","Integrative Animal Biology"
"This project aims at developping wettable composite cathodes as an alternative for existing graphite cathodes in aluminium smelting cells. The project addresses specifically the energy efficiency challenges of the aluminum industry. A solution is proposed by providing a wettable and durable cathode material which allows the reduction of the anode-cathode distance (ACD) and the increase of the energy efficiency and the average cell lifetime.

The cathodes, conventionally made of carbonaceous materials, are operating in a very aggressive environment at high temperatures. The issues encountered with these materials are: 1) early failure due to wear, 2) low wettability, 3) high reactivity with the electrolyte and liquid aluminium, and 4) high energy losses due to the large ACD. The challenges in finding alternative materials are, consequently, to overcome these problems while meeting the other required specifications such as: 1) high electrical conductivity, 2) low cost, and 3) adaptability with the existing technology. The cells productivity and the cells average lifetime are important factors contributing to the capital-cost while the ACD is one of the most important parameters responsible for the energy losses.

The new materials proposed in this project are metal-ceramic refractory composites with functional grain boundary phases. The refractory ceramic material insures the high wear resistance while the grain boundary phase provides the wettability and structural integrity of the composite.

With nearly 3 million tonnes of production capacity, the Canadian aluminium industry (third in the world in term of importance) plays a major role in the national economy. The scientific and technical knownledges generated by the project will help the Canadian industry to keep its leadership position amoung the producing countries.

"This proposal aims to exploit the unique structural features of nanostructured mixed oxides obtained by the high energy ball milling (HEBM) technique to develop high performance and low cost gas sensors. Gas sensors are widely used in different fields from domestic safety and process control to monitoring environmental pollutants and the automotive industry. Environmental concerns and the implementation of tougher legislation have led to greater demand for more and more sensitive and accurate sensors at an affordable cost. Recent research indicates that nanostructured metal oxides are becoming the key materials for the development of gas sensors with improved gas-sensing properties. The expected improvements are considerable due to their high surface area and small particle size. However, manufacturing techniques of such materials face challenges with respect to waste treatment, mass production and cost. HEBM is one of the synthesis techniques with proven marketable capabilities for fabrication of low cost and high performance oxide-based nanocatalysts. Innermost similarities between the catalysts and gas sensor functions let believe that HEBM is a suitable manufacturing route for oxide sensors as well. It is therefore the goal of this proposal to first prove the suitability of HEBM for sensor applications. The research projects will then focus on the synthesis and screening of a number of formulations to reveal the effect of process parameters and chemical compositions on the physicochemical and gas sensing properties of nanostructured oxides (namely perovskite structures with a general formula of ABO3). Finally, with a deeper understanding of process and material characteristics, we aim to optimise the oxide formulation and manufacturing process to develop sensors with favourable structures, high performance and at an affordable cost. At the completion of this program, it is expected that HEBM will be recognized as a suitable manufacturing technique for perovskite gas sensors and the technology will be transferred to Canadian industry; already active in the exploitation of similar technology in other application areas.

"This project is planned to optimize the anode manufacturing technology addressing the challenges related to the effect of anode quality of both the energy consumption in anode manufacturing process and the performance of smelting cells. The challenge of the present anode technology is to produce consistently high quality anodes while dealing with frequent changes in the incoming raw materials and limiting the amount of fuel used for anode baking. The issues encountered with low quality anodes are anode disintegration and outright failure resulting not only in the loss of the energy required for the anode production, but also in the perturbation of the current flow and magnetic field increasing the extra power consumption. 216,000 tons of carbon is annually consumed in excess, in Qu�bec alone. In the modern smelting plans a significant reduction of carbon consumption in electrolytic bath is not possible while the perspective for implementation of inert anodes is not clear either. In time, the improvement of anode quality and production process is most likely the only way to reasonably reduce the excess carbon consumption.

A solution is proposed by providing an accurate simulation tool being able to predict the anode quality and adjust the process parameters to compensate the effect of material and process variations providing high quality anodes and reducing the anode failure and disintegration. The simulation is based on a profound understanding of mechanisms governing each production step and the effect of sensitive parameters on physico-chemical properties of baked anodes. At the completion of the proposed project, it is expected that mechanisms of failure and disintegration be better understood and a reliable model be developed leading to monitor and to better control of the process, to adopt an optimum set of parameters of each step, and to take the corrective actions. With an annual production of 3 million tonnes, the Canadian aluminum industry ranks third among world producers.

"Poor security of software systems (in form of high vulnerability to intrusions) may allow unauthorized takeover of the critical functionalities of those systems, leading to events ranging from bank fraud to terrorist activities. Since late fixing of security flaws tends to be more time consuming and expensive, it is important to have faster modeling techniques that would assist designers to analyze designs quickly and easily, early in the design cycle. All designs involve tradeoffs and if we simply optimize for the security attribute, we stand the chance of ignoring other attributes of importance, for example performance and dependability, which are affected by security solutions. My proposed research is concerned with developing modeling techniques and tools that would help in analyzing multiple attributes - performance, dependability and security - in a unified way, and would aid in better understanding of design tradeoffs. Key features of this proposal include: (i) development of novel modeling techniques for probabilistic validation of security of software systems, (ii) integrated models to analyze performance, dependability and security, (iii) training of research students in the engineering of dependable and secure software.

"Among the four fundamental forces in nature, only gravity has not been quantized, nor has it been unified with the other three (electromagnetic, strong and weak nuclear). Thus, the satisfactory formulation of a quantum theory of gravity remains as one of the most important challenges of theoretical physics. Black holes on the other hand, which are solutions of Einstein's theory of general relativity, and have event horizons, serve as theoretical laboratories for testing various proposals of quantum gravity. They are believed to have entropy and temperature, understanding the microscopic origin of which is hoped to shed light on the nature of quantum gravity. Continuing to work in black hole physics, I would like to examine whether quantum entanglement between fields inside and outside a horizon can be a source of black hole entropy, and try to identify the location of the degrees of freedom which give rise to this entropy. I would also like to study possible experimental signatures of mini black holes, which have been predicted by brane world scenarios to form in future high energy colliders. These signatures may result from radiation emitted and from the shedding of angular momentum from these black holes. I also intend to study the black hole information loss problem and explore whether the techniques used in Quantum Information Science (in which too I have worked in the past) can be used in that context. Finally, I intend to diversify my research into cosmology.



In the above areas of research, there is considerable room for innovation, collaboration, and the opportunity to train a number of highly qualified personnel.

"My research seeks to explain the origin of physics of black holes through the search for a new theory called quantum gravity. Black holes are gravitating objects in the universe that absorb everything including light, and appear completely `black' in astrophysical observations. Black holes are detected by the accreting matter that falls into them by observing the X-rays that are radiated. Previously it was thought that falling matter are eventually destroyed at a central singularity, but my recent work, 'Semi classical quantization of space-times with apparent horizons,' shows that matter is not destroyed, as the central singularity is smoothened. Thus, I propose to take my results further and obtain any significant effect of this in astrophysical observations to confirm my predictions of singularity resolution.  In the same paper, I demonstrated that the boundary of the black hole, the horizon, has degrees of freedom like that of a gas, thereby solving the puzzle of why the black hole behaves as a thermodynamic system.  As part of my proposed research, I will use the formalism to solve the famous information loss problem of black holes, due to Hawking radiation.  I am also currently working in `Euclidean quantum gravity' and I shall use my results to find new effects in the `wave function of the universe', which  describes the evolution of the universe from the point it was created, to what it will evolve into in the future.

"In my last grant proposal I summarised my works on two basic areas of research: string cosmology and flux compactifications. I have continued on these two topics, and have also started working on thermal field theories like high temperature QCD etc using tools of string theory. The field of high temperature QCD has recently become very active due to some interesting inputs from string theory. String theory predicts that certain gauge theories could be studied from dual gravity backgrounds where all calculations of these gauge theories have one-to-one correspondences in the gravity theories. This would mean, in particular, that certain non-trivial calculations of gauge theories (that were thought to be rather impossible to do using conventional techniques) could now be easily performed using this new duality. Using these techniques, a year ago it was found that the ratio of the viscosity of any thermal fluid to its entropy cannot be smaller than a certain number. This was a very surprising conclusion that came out directly from applying string theory methods (its difficult to predict this using conventional gauge theory techniques). Question however is whether this ""bound"" is robust.  We have recently found that the predicted bound could be lowered by incorporating string theory corrections. However the analysis is highly involved and would require time and the efforts of few graduate students to work this out completely. It will be really fascinating if we could find a new bound here, as this would be the first concrete prediction of string theory for the real world. 

My second proposed research activity is to apply string theory techniques to the field of cosmology. This field has already become very active now with some very interesting progress to report. One of the project that I'm interested right now is to understand inflationary dynamics and sources of primordial magnetic fields from string theory. It seems cosmic strings are the only viable candiates that could explain the origins of primordial magnetic field. I've already started working on this with my graduate students and we hope to predict something from our analysis soon.

"Sedimentary rocks in the subsurface host significant quantities of the world's oil, natural gas, and water resources. Consequently, being able to predict the distribution of sediments in these reservoirs is vital to the effective exploration for and responsible development of hydrocarbons and potable water. In many cases, the sands and gravels that comprise sandstones and conglomerates were deposited along coastlines similar to those that ring the world's oceans today. Scientists studying the distribution of sediments (sedimentology) and animal burrows (ichnology) along these coastlines have developed qualitative (observation-based) models that are used to predict the overall geometry and internal architecture of sandstones and conglomerates. These qualitative models, however, are no longer adequate for deciphering the complexities inherent in sedimentary rocks. The best mechanism for improving upon existing models is through the quantification and semi-quantification of observations made on modern coastlines. Whereas qualitative models present idealized examples, mathematical relations derived from the modern can be used to make quantitative predictions of the architecture and geometry of sedimentary successions. This is particularly important in the subsurface, where predictive tools developed in the modern can be used to extrapolate and model subsurface data beyond the well bore - be it an oil well or water well. 

    This research initiative aims to quantify the sedimentology, ichnology, and hydraulic conditions of sand- and gravel-dominated beaches and deltas on the southwest coast of British Columbia. It is anticipated that through this work, mathematical relations can be derived and new quantitative-based models developed that account for the significant variability observed in sedimentary successions preserved in the rock record.

"This research program combines the theoretical and experimental research of mechanisms of flow and sediment transport involved in the deformation of bed and banks of alluvial streams with the development of physically-based, high-accuracy numerical models for the simulation and prediction of river morphological changes. These changes may occur naturally or as a response to direct or indirect human river interventions. The research focuses on: 1- large-scale turbulence coherent structures and their morphological consequences; and 2- bed morphological changes and bank migration in meandering streams.

       An extensive series of experiments will be carried out in a 20m-long straight channel having an adjustable width from 1m to 2m. In these experiments, events of generation, growth and decay of large-scale coherent structures and their morphological consequences will be recorded. This study is expected to yield a better understanding of the development of large-scale bed forms (alternate and multiple bars) and the development of incipient stream deviations from straight alignment eventually leading to meandering or braiding. It will also constitute a foundation for the future modelling of these processes.

       Additionally, the mechanisms of flow and sediment transport involved in bed and bank deformation in meandering streams will be investigated. For this purpose, initial (non-equilibrium) laboratory meandering streams lying on a 21m-long, 7m-wide sand basin, will be subjected to a variety of flow conditions and their time-evolution will be monitored. The new data and insights will be used to develop two numerical models:

(i) a 3-D based model for the computation of meandering bed topography and its time-evolution; and (ii) a model for the simulation of the long-term planimetric evolution of meanders and prediction of meander migration rates. These models are expected to constitute valuable tools to assess the impact on the physical environment of both natural and man-induced meandering morphological changes.

       This research program will result in the training of 3 Ph.D. Students, 3 M.Sc. students and 1 B.Sc student.

"Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems often need to service data requests from telecommunications and web-based

clients around the globe.  To boost performance and to increase data availability, unstructured P2P systems

employ replication to bring data closer to where it is needed, or to increase system or data resources.  A

common replication strategy is to use result caching, which distributes replicas of query results in the

P2P system. This strategy, however, does not provide any data freshness guarantees since cached result

copies will become stale as the primary copy is updated. Thus, stale replicas or copies can preclude their

use by P2P applications that require fresh data.

     A key goal of this proposal is to provide data freshness guarantees in P2P systems.  There are several

problems with providing freshness guarantees that this proposal seeks to address.  First, a replication strategy

that determines which peers in the system should cache the result is needed, keeping in mind that a large

number of choices exist.  Second, an update propagation strategy needs to be designed that would determine

how, and which, replicas in the P2P system should be refreshed given that refreshing all replicas is likely to

be costly and unfeasible.  Third, due to network churn and failure, peers may become unavailable or new

peers may join the system.  Thus, techniques for supporting replication need to work gracefully in the face

of this potential dynamism in the P2P system.  Another key goal of this research proposal is to design and

develop a set of techniques that can provide a spectrum of design choices that take data freshness and

performance into consideration.  These techniques would quantify the trade-offs between freshness and

performance, given that providing fresher data is likely to be more costly but the storage and management

of available but undesired stale data is likely to waste system resources.

"Microbial processes fall into two categories: synthesis reactions and degradative reactions. Synthesis reactions create high value biomolecules used in the biotechnology industry. Degradative reactions provide a biological means for treating contaminated soil and water. In both types of reactions microbes can be inhibited by the toxicity of molecules involved in the transformations, making these processes inefficient. The introduction of a separate, immiscible phase to selectively partition such toxic molecules to, or away from, microbial cells is the rationale behind the design and operation of Two-Phase Partitioning Bioreactors (TPPBs). By maintaining aqueous concentrations of target molecules at sub-toxic levels, TPPBs allow microbial cells to operate at their highest efficiency.  Research groups in more than 15 countries are now exploring TPPB applications based on our patented technology platform. Until recently, the second phase in a TPPB would have been an immiscible organic liquid.  We recently made a decisive breakthrough in TPPB technology by showing that solid polymer beads, plastic pellets, can be used as the second phase for the uptake and release of target molecules. The use of inexpensive, non-volatile, non-flammable, biocompatible and easily-shaped polymers in a bioreactor is an enormous advance in designing high-efficiency processes that eliminate cell toxicity and is key to the development of ""green"", solvent-free processing. In the proposed research 3 model systems for the production of high-value products will be operated to confirm the superiority of solid-liquid TPPBs in biotechnology applications. In addition, we will demonstrate the use of solid-liquid TPPBs for the treatment of soil and water sources heavily contaminated with fuel hydrocarbons, and soil contaminated with polyaromatic hydrocarbons.  Potential applications include the many Brownfields sites across Canada, the Alberta Tar Sands polluted water reservoirs and the Sydney Tar Ponds, all of which could benefit from the successful demonstration of our technology. Renewed NSERC support is vital for us to exploit our polymer breakthrough, advance TPPB technology in two key sectors and maintain our international lead in developing a green bioprocessing strategy.","Pollutants and toxic agents (waste, use 902)","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng."
"Rising fuel costs and the impact of fossil fuel combustion on the environment is driving research into new types of burners, boilers, and process furnaces.  These devices are traditionally designed by trial-and-error, where the engineer first guesses a design (usually based on an existing device) and then manually adjusts it using his or her experience and intuition until process-specific requirements are satisfied.  While the outcome may be satisfactory it is rarely optimal, however, since the complexity of combustion makes an intuitive ""feel"" for how the design parameters affect the system's performance illusive to the designer.  Moreover, since this process relies exclusively on existing devices and the engineer's prior experience, this process suppresses any possibility of identifying novel solutions to these design problems.



Design optimization is a dramatic improvement over the trial-and-error process.  This procedure transforms the design problem into a mathematical minimization problem by defining a vector of parameters that specify the design configuration and an objective function that quantifies the ""goodness"" of a particular design in such a way that it is minimized by the optimal design outcome.  For example, the objective function may be defined to minimize the pollution emitted by a burner, and the burner geometry and fuel/air mixture ratio.cold be specified by the design parameters.  Specialized mathematical algorithms are then used to find the vector of design parameters that minimize the objective function; this vector specifies the optimal design. 



The objective of this research is to develop a generic optimal design methodology that can be adopted by the industrial combustion community to develop cleaner and more efficient combustion devices for process heat transfer and energy generation.  Such devices will prove essential for securing Canada's economic and environmental future.

In the last years, I studied several distribution problems associated with elliptic curves over the rationals, in collaboration with several co-authors. This is a very active research area, and I intend to extend my previous work in various different directions in the next years. For example, a conjecture of N. Koblitz gives an exact asymptotic for the number of primes such that the group of points modulo p of a given elliptic curve over Q has prime order. This has applications to public key cryptography. In a recent work with A. Balog and A. Cojocaru, we proved that Koblitz's conjecture is true on average, when one takes the average over all elliptic curves in a box. This work raises a lot of new interesting questions, which are addressed in this proposal.



Another facet of my research is the study of the vanishing of special values of L-functions of elliptic curves in families. The vanishing of L-functions is a major problem of number theory. For L-functions of elliptic curves, the order of vanishing at the central critical point is related to the rank of the curve by the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. It is believed that very few L-functions would vanish in a given reasonable family, but there are almost no such results proven up to now.  Over the previous years, in collaboration with J. Fearnley and H. Kisilevsky, we used random matrix theory to predict the number of  twists of a given order of an elliptic curve vanishing at the central critical point. In another work in progress, with collaborators D. Milicevic and G. Ricotta, we are finding a lower bound for the number of non-vanishing cubic twists of an elliptic curve over the quadratic extension of Q obtained by adding a third root of unity.

"� travers le monde, la production d'�nergie est largement tributaire de la performance des grandes machines tournantes.

L'entretien et la maintenance de ces �quipements sont donc primordiaux pour assurer la fiabilit� de l'approvisionnement en �nergie des diff�rents r�seaux ainsi que pour planifier les interventions de maintenance au moment appropri�. Les deux probl�mes les plus fr�quents reli�s � l'entretien des bobinages statoriques des grandes machines

Pour ces deux situations, il est possible de corriger le probl�me par une intervention d'ass�chage ou de nettoyage. Par contre, ces op�rations sont co�teuses et n�cessitent le retrait de service de l'�quipement. Le but de ce projet est, d'une part, de d�velopper des outils non destructifs de d�tection et de caract�risation de ces probl�mes et, d'autre part, d'�valuer l'impact de ces probl�mes sur le bon fonctionnement du syst�me d'isolation en service.

Jusqu'� ce jour ces questions restent sans r�ponses pr�cises et le programme d'entretien des machines relativement � ces probl�mes ne suit aucune r�gle pr�cise.

"This proposal seeks funding for my research program applying indirect methods to experimental nuclear astrophysics. The focus of this research is the experimental determination of the rates of nuclear reactions that occur in stars and astrophysical explosions. These reaction rates must be known in order to understand how energy is released in stars and stellar explosions, and to discover the origins of the chemical elements. Many of 

the most important reactions involve radioactive nuclei that don't occur naturally on Earth, and therefore must be created in the laboratory in order to be studied. Nuclear reaction rates can be determined directly if a beam of sufficient intensity can be produced, but such intense beams are available for only a tiny fraction of the relevant nuclei. In cases where direct study is presently impossible, indirect methods can be brought to bear. These methods, which involve the determination of the properties of the states of the compound nuclei formed 

in reactions of astrophysical interest, are quite powerful and often yield sufficient information to determine the nuclear reaction rates needed. One of the tools we intend to exploit at TRIUMF in the future for these studies of nuclear structure relevant to astrophysics is the recently funded ElectroMagnetic Mass Analyser (EMMA), of which I am the principal investigator. EMMA is a recoil mass spectrometer that will be used to separate the recoils of nuclear reactions from the beam used to produce them and to disperse the recoils according to their charge-to-mass ratio. We are currently building EMMA, and anticipate that it will be fully commissioned and ready for first experiments in 2011, at which point we will apply for an EMMA project grant. Until that time, it is essential that I continue to carry out my experimental program. As I am very busy with EMMA, I require a group of students and postdoctoral researchers to help me with this research. I therefore request continued funding for my research in indirect methods in experimental nuclear astrophysics via an individual discovery grant. This would support my ongoing experiments at TRIUMF, including student and postdoc salaries as well as detectors, electronics, and travel to conferences.

"Physical, biological and chemical systems often have properties that cannot be understood by simply studying their building blocks or constituents but are emergent. The very nature of emergence or complexity can be summarized by the statement that such a system is more than the sum of its parts. Typically, emergent properties and patterns are intimately related to a dynamical organization process in space and time far away from equilibrium. Understanding emergent properties and patterns, their stability and the self-organization processes leading to them is one of the central quests of modern physics.



Prominent examples of such systems include seismicity and the human heart, with immense importance for society. A detailed understanding of seismicity is required to ensure successful seismic hazard assessment and to test the possibility of successful earthquake prediction. A detailed understanding of the heart dynamics is essential to prevent fibrillation and sudden cardiac death.



This research program on ""Physics of complex systems: Emergent properties and dynamical organization"" will establish new general concepts and tools to characterize and understand systems far from equilibrium, will identify generic and universal properties by analyzing observational data sets, and will collaborate with leading experimental and theoretical groups to develop accurate theories for specific classes of systems. The specific phenomena under consideration are in particular seismicity pattern dynamics, rock fracture and defect-mediated turbulence and will provide important guidance for new advances in the field.

"My research program is a broadly based program in the study of nonself-adjoint operator algebras and operator theory.  This is one aspect of modern functional analysis, which seeks to model various phenomena as (algebras of) linear maps, and exploit various powerful tools to understand their structure.  My current areas of focus include dynamical systems, representation theory, hyper-reflexivity and interpolation.

        I associate two natural universal operator algebras to a dynamical system with multiple maps.  The main result is that the dynamical system may be recovered from the operator algebra up to piecewise conjugacy.  I am now exploring important special cases, and considering incorporating relations between the maps.

        I am continuing my study of free semigroup algebras, with a particular focus on the recalcitrant problem of existence of wandering vectors.  We have successfully begun a study of a higher dimensional analogue arising from ""higher rank graphs"".   

        Hyper-reflexivity is a quantitative measure of reflexivity. When one has this property, there are often strong conclusions.  We characterize precisely which subspaces have the optimal constant 1. We now ask whether hyper-reflexivity implies complete hyper-reflexivity? We expect that this is generally false, but that it may be true for masa bimodules.

        Interpolation of analytic functions is a classical subject with deep connections to operator theory.  Specifically, understanding matrix interpolation requires understanding the C*-envelope of the associated quotient algebra.  We consider a special case of functions on the unit disk with a derivative constraint at the origin.  Here a family of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces lead to a continuous family of Pick conditions.  This solves the scalar interpolation problem; but we show that the matrix interpolation problem is more complicated.

"In this project, I seek to understand the relation between emotion and memory in the human brain. Emotional events and life experiences tend to be more easily recollected than everyday ones, and studies of emotion and memory in the laboratory have shown that emotional stimuli (such as words or pictures) are generally easier to remember than neutral ones. This phenomenon has been labelled the ""emotional enhancement of memory"" (EEM) effect, but its brain basis has only recently begun to be explored. So far, cognitive neuroscience studies have focused on the amygdala and its interactions with the hippocampus in exploring the brain basis of EEM. However, in this project I propose to examine the potential role of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in EEM. PFC has massive interconnections with the amygdala and hippocampus, and has been implicated in the relation between emotion and cognitive functions other than memory. Although there are a few functional neuroimaging studies that have explored emotion and memory in the PFC, human lesion studies are few. Specifically, I seek to determine 1) whether prefrontal degeneration or damage affects the EEM effect, 2) whether particular regions of prefrontal cortex are more important than others in supporting EEM, and 3) the potential effects of valence, arousal, and organization. In our first line of research, I will study patients with Parkinson's disease, who show structural deterioration of all three critical brain regions: the hippocampus, the amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. In the second line, I will study patients with focal prefrontal lesions. This work will tell us more about how the relation between emotion and memory is supported by the brain, and whether (and how) the prefrontal cortex plays a critical role.",Psychology,"Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences"

"The increasing demand for ubiquitous broadband wireless access with differentiated services, such as voice, email, and interactive multimedia, is a key driving force for advances in wireless communication technologies. The availability of multiple antennas at one or both ends of a wireless link provides the potential for substantial increases in the achievable rate and the reliability of the link, and hence these multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) systems appear, in some form, in the physical layer of almost all proposals for future wireless communication systems. However, the wireless medium is fundamentally a shared environment, with an inherent broadcast capability, but also mutual interference. The communication resources provided by the environment can be used more efficiently if the physical layer of the wireless network (or networks) is designed to take advantage of the shared nature of the environment, as distinct from optimizing the performance of each link independently, and if it does so dynamically. This dynamic allocation of resources offers the potential for a substantial increase in the quality of service that can be offered, both in the case of networks with some form of centralized control, such as the uplink and downlink of single-cell systems, and networks in which control is distributed, such as cooperative communication systems, spectral overlay (""cognitive"") systems, and ad-hoc networks. The goal of the proposed research program is to develop computationally-efficient design techniques for multi-user transceivers that enable wireless networks to make efficient use of the available resources. The resulting systems will form some of the building blocks with which the visions of future wireless networks will be realized. The development of the design techniques will be guided by insights from (and contributions to) multi-user information theory and optimization, and the implementation of the designs will take advantage of the flexibility provided by the ""software radio"" transceiver architecture. The focus of the work will be on the development of fundamental design principles, but specializations of these principles could be applied to systems developed by particular standards bodies or companies.

In order to target resources and research effectively, it is necessary to identify which food safety risks are most critical to Canadians.  A variety of factors, including public health, economic effects and social implications, must be considered when trying to rank the importance of a food safety risk. This research project will develop a Prioritization Framework that will incorporate these factors for various food safety risks. Once developed, the Framework can then be used to compare different food safety risks and rank them.

"Farmed salmon is British Columbia's most significant agricultural export and returns over $600 M to the provincial economy each year. Domestic markets for salmon are growing as the nutritional and health value of salmon are increasingly recognized, and exceptional commercial opportunities lie in the rapidly expanding US and Asian markets. To take advantage of these international markets will require increased production at a decreased cost. A broodstock development program is an essential component of an aquaculture company's strategy if it is to remain competitive in the international marketplace by producing fish with the most desirable performance traits in an economically and efficient manner. Broodstock development programs benefit from the application of genomic technologies. The objective of this project is to integrate recent advances in genomic technologies in particular a 16K Atlantic salmon SNP array, into Mainstream Canada's existing Atlantic salmon

family based broodstock development program to increase its competitiveness in the international arena. We have assembled a team whose members have complementary skills that include salrnonid genomics, livestock genetic improvement, genotyping, broodstock and hatchery management, and phenotype-genotype relationships and broodstock selection. Highly qualified personnel, who will become leaders in the use of marker assisted selection in broodstock development programs, will be trained in this project.

"Icy Waters Ltd. is an inland freshwater aquaculture facility based in Whitehorse that has specialized in the

production of Arctic charr table fish and eyed eggs for grow-out sites for over 20 years. Arctic charr is a cold

water salmonid found in Northern regions throughout the world. It is an especially attractive aquaculture

species given that it features the desirable traits ofother salmonids, but can be bred and grown at resource

friendly inland tank farms all year round. Indeed, Arctic charr has recently been added to the Monterey Bay

Aquarium's Best Choice list for sustainable seafood. Arctic charr thrives at temperatures between -1 C and

12 C, but many existing freshwater tank farms that are otherwise interested in Arctic charr production are set

up in locations that experience temperatures well beyond this range in summer months. This is an increasingly

relevant concern for Icy Waters Ltd. and their customers in the face ofclimate change. Indeed, record high

water temperatures in the Yukon in 2004 resulted in massive losses offish. The goal ofthis project is to use

genetics to produce a temperature tolerant Arctic charr broodstock. Genetic markers associated with thermal

tolerance will be identified through temperature exposure experiments and analyses ofthe genes that are up

and down regulated during heat exposure. We will integrate this information into an existing marker assisted

selection breeding program, ultimately producing a line of Arctic charr that is more temperature tolerant. This

will enable the growth of Icy Waters Ltd., an environmentally sustainable, Yukon based, Canadian owned

"I propose to create a system that finds statistical regularities in databases of labeled images, as well as quantitative ranges of qualitative descriptors (e.g. fairly tall men are between 5'10"" and 6'4"" in height)  to create a visuospatial scene generation (VSG) model.  The model will output a symbolic scene description that includes the following information: 1) what objects are present in the scene, 2) which particular images to use to represent those objects, 3) where those objects are, both in terms of absolute location and relative to other objects, and 4) quantitative magnitudes of input adjectives and prepositions (such as ""large"" or ""above"").  More specifically, it will output these things in terms of probability distributions. 

   This model will be used in several ways: 1)  it can be used as a part of a generate-and-test algorithm for computer vision, as other generative models have done. 2) it can be used to suggest to computer vision systems what other objects might be likely to appear in an image, and indeed where they might be in the image.  These suggestions will improve the vision system's final classification decisions. 3) the system can be used to create actual images for people to view.  In the longer term, tools such as these would provide inspiration to creative illustrators working on open-ended problems: for example, those who create posters, illustrations, and other kinds of graphical layouts.  Additionally, it will be a first pass at a model of human visual imagination.

    The system will be evaluated with use of object recognition programs, and through user testing.

"The service demands from residential home networks are rapidly surpassing the capabilities of the access networks which connect the customers to the internet. Telco ISP's find themselves in this unenviable position through the forgivable albeit short-sighted approach of upgrading their service platform by building siloed services. All routing, QOS, content, and other services are managed within the silo with no compatibility or interaction with other business units in the Telco entity. Thus the notion of more efficient composition of services is extremely difficult to implement.

The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is a standard whose proponents (the 3GPP and 3GPPV) claim contains the roadmap out of silo architectures toward a future of service oriented functionality. This true to a point but it is questionable that IMS will place Telco service providers in a optimal position to compete in a purely IP world. IMS is inherently incompatible with service architectures like web-services and requires special connectivity structures to enable web-services. Also IMS is complicated and viewed with suspicion by Telco ISPs.



In the proposed program, the researchers will address 3 main issues of confusion in ISP evolution to service oriented functionality:



1. The viability of the IMS in Enabling the Telco ISP to migrate from a silo architecture to a service oriented architecture.

2. Hybrid IMS/Service oriented models that may ease the transition for the large ISP.

3. Verification of the new service models on a functional core/access network testbed.



The results from the research will be immediately transferable to telcos and other ISPs involved in service based business development. The research project will build on a residential services testbed that has been built up over 5 years at TRLabs. The project will be undertaken with regular consultation with TRLabs Telco industry partners.

"Molten Salt Hydrates (MSHs) are promising media for chemical metallurgical processes. These are highly concentrated salt solutions, for example, molten FeSO4-7H2O or CaCl2-4H2O where the polar water molecule is bound to the salt. This gives MSHs a number of unusual properties that put them in a different class than brines or molten salts. MSHs can exist as liquids at temperatures above 300oC at atmospheric pressures, albeit with some level of humidity. MSHs also have both a high heat capacity and a large heat of hydration. These properties suggest diverse applications and at higher temperatures compared to those in aqueous processing. Despite this exciting potential, molten salt hydrates have had no systematic study. Most of the research that has been done is sporadic, exploring a few aspects and applications of MSHs with little actual elucidation of

their fundamental chemistry. Investigations have been done on MSHs for heat storage, using both sensible heat and latent heat of hydration. Some MSHs have been explored as quasi-aqueous media for reactions, including serpentine carbonation and cellulose derivitization. This more applied part of the project (MSc) will seek to employ the corrosive nature of magnesium chloride MSHs in leaching refractory, magnesium-rich laterite nickel ores, and then using hydrolysis to achieve an acid recycle loop. This project will also serve as a demonstration of the potential of these systems. At present, magnesium-rich ores can presently only be treated by melting in electric furnaces, a costly process requiring enormous amounts of energy. A systematic array of leaching tests will be performed on laterite ore samples to determine the advantages of the use of MSHs for mineral processing and upgrading. Simultaneously, a series of experiments by the PhD student will examine more fundamental aspects of molten salt hydrates to better understand the role of the type of salt to the properties and water activity in the system. This work will provide data for a new molten salt hydrate thermodynamic model that would allow predictions of the interaction of MSH with metal oxide systems at a variety of temperatures.","Mineral resources ( prospecting, exploration, mining, extraction, processing)","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"

"Human skin is one of the largest and most complex organ systems in the body forming a functional barrier between the external environment and the internal structures.  Within the skin, a delicate compositional and organizational balance of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is required for proper function.  In addition to ECM proteins, cutaneous blood vessels are also critical for the development and function of skin by providing an essential supply of oxygen and nutrients.  Recently, we have discovered that mice lacking the protein, fibulin-5, have a significant increase in the number of cutaneous blood vessels. This observation led us to the hypothesis that fibulin-5 can influence blood vessels formation (angiogenesis) in a negative manner.  The short-term goal of our research program, therefore, is to understand the basic biological mechanism of fibulin-5 in the regulation of angiogenesis.  In the long-term, our research program is focused on determining how ECM proteins direct and control blood vessel development and stability.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Cell Biology"

"This NSERC discovery grant proposes several inter-related projects, each suitable for a graduate student or postdoctoral trainee,  continuing my research work at the intersection of financial mathematics, operational research, and mathematical modelling.  This research program arises from the well-known ""Real Options""  observation that many real decisions are made i) under uncertainty and ii) in ways which allow all or part of the decision to be postponed or modified.  Many financial decisions arising in the fund management and energy industries as well as certain non-financial decisions encountered by military and health-care practitioners share this form. In applied areas much mathematical modelling is often required in order to identify the option-like features of a problem.  



Each project described in this proposal relates either to: 1) the development of mathematical and computational tools for valuing and best using these options or 2) the mathematical modelling of a particular application area designed to expose such options for analysis either with the special techniques developed here or by more standard techniques. 



Green energy systems comprising hydro-electric, wind power, and ethanol production will be analyzed and optimized, realistic investment portfolios will be optimized and characterized, and problems drawn from military operational research and radiation therapy will be considered.  Application areas will always be studied in conjunction with field experts, where possible those with relevant experience as practitioners.

"Capelin, a small minnow-like fish, is the focal forage fish species that preys on many invertebrates and is in turn preyed on by most large predators, including cod, seals, whales and birds in the Northwest Atlantic. Capelin provide essential linkages for energy transfer among trophic levels and, thus, are often thought to mediate ecosystem-level changes. In previously NSERC-funded expeditions, we discovered capelin spawning in deep water (demersal) in coastal Newfoundland, where this species is primarily thought to spawn on beaches. Large aggregations of capelin form at these spawning sites, causing predators to concentrate. This results in areas where high abundances of organisms gather, often referred to as 'biological hotspots'. Our research aims to determine whether capelin select between beach and demersal spawning habitat on the basis of current environmental conditions or whether capelin are obligate beach and demersal spawners. We also examine the time and energetic consequences of foraging within hotspots by top predators. To do this, we employ a novel assemblage of sophisticated marine electronic equipment aboard ships combined with genetic and stable isotope analytical techniques, as well as predator diets and telemetry-based foraging activities. Our research involves collaborative efforts between university researchers and commercial fishers, which has and will continue to make major advancements in our understanding of capelin ecology and how it influences top predators. Ultimately, this research will increase the accuracy of capelin stock assessment indices and promote novel, incisive fisheries management approaches to avoid ecological and socioeconomic catastrophes that have occurred in our coastal waters and communities around the globe.

"Spray nozzles are employed by Kelsan Technologies Corporation to distribute a liquid form of their friction modifiers on the top of railroad tracks. These friction modifiers reduce the energy consumption of railroad locomotives by up to 6% and also reduce the wear on the rail and the wheel flanges by in excess of 50%. The fuel and capital cost savings through use of friction modifiers on rails in North America alone could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars annually. There would also be concomitant environmental benefits to the reduced diesel fuel consumption.

For the rail friction modifier to operate effectively, it must coat the rail well. Although Kelsan's existing spraye system has demonstrated satisfactory atomizing performance in the laboratory, it requires separately metered liquid and air supplies. In simple terms, the existing sprayer system is too complex and expensive for widespread use. In many instances where the application of top-of-rail (TOR) friction modifiers would be of considerable benefit - such as at the intermediate axles of long freight trains, or in many urban transit systems -there is simply no readily available supply of air. For these applications, additional compressors must be installed; further increasing the cost of implementing TOR friction control.

To address this issue, and hence to promote the increased adoption of TOR friction control, this research will investigate the potential of using single fluid atomizers for delivering Kelsan's LFM to the rail head. A range of 'airless' sprayers will be tested in both still air and a cross-wind. Sprayers with superior droplet coverage and reliability will be identified.

"It is well known that natural gas (NG) does not auto-ignite under conventional diesel engine operating conditions. Hot surface ignition (HSI) provides a practical solution to this problem. Therefore, the objectives of the proposed research program are twofold; at the most fundamental level, the research is intended to develop an improved understanding of the role of entrainment and mixing on the ignition and combustion of turbulent gaseous fuel jets impinging on a hot surface. At an applied level, the objective of the research is to develop a robust hot-surface igniter for use in a direct-injected, natural gas fuelled, diesel cycle engines.



An integrated series of controlled rig-based experiments, optically-accessed engine experiments, and numerical simulations will be performed using methane as a control fuel. The proposed research program will provide a better fundamental understanding of the requirements for reliable ignition and combustion in a HSI direct-injected NG engine. The data acquired during this study will enable improved numerical models of ignition and combustion to be developed for this class of engine and will thus, both directly and indirectly, facilitate the development of an optimized NG HSI diesel-cycle engine. The optimized engine will offer substantial CO2 reduction benefits and reduced levels of other pollutants emissions when compared to conventional diesel and spark-ignited engines. In contrast to the duel-fuel 'pilot-ignited' operation of direct-injection NG engines, the HSI approach is readily applicable to medium and light-duty applications. Accordingly, direct-injected NG HSI engines will be well suited to power future, fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles.

"Cells polarize by segregating certain components such as proteins to different areas in the cell, creating biochemically distinct domains. Intracellular polarization is a critically important biological process seen in most complex organisms, including humans. Polarized cells are crucial for proper health and development: polarized embryonic cells divide asymmetrically to produce different daughter cells, polarized epithelial cells join into tightly connected sheets to form skin and the lining of organs, and polarized fibroblasts crawl to the site of tissue injury to aid in repair. Cancer metastasis and other diseases result from abnormal cell polarization, motivating the study of this important process.

   In my research, I combine theoretical and experimental techniques to examine how components in the cell segregate into different domains and to understand how interactions between these components can maintain these domains. Experimentally, I use embryos of the nematode worm C. elegans to visualize the location and dynamics of specific proteins, both before and after the worms have been treated to modify the expression of certain proteins. Theoretically, I construct mathematical models of components in the cell and their complex network of interactions that are thought to be important for polarization. These models allow me to track the evolution in space and time of these components and I can compare the model results with experimental data. There is continuous feedback between the experimental and theoretical research since the model results suggest further experiments and experimental data suggests ways to improve the models.

   Similar molecules are involved in polarization across cell types suggesting that this is an ancient and evolutionarily conserved biological process. Insights gained by studying polarization in one cell type will impact our knowledge of polarization in other cell types, and the combination of theoretical and experimental approaches will lead to a better understanding of how small scale molecular interactions can give rise to large scale organization in the cell.

"A growing proportion of our energy may well be derived from renewable sources such as wind, solar, wave, water vortices and tides as concerns about global warming and energy sustainability increase. These sources produce energy intermittently or unpredictably. The solution is to develop battery storage facilities from which energy can be tapped when required. In contrast, the availability of a large amount of energy and power, on a time scale of seconds or minutes rather than hours is a concern for back-up power on server farms and is of growing importance as the internet, search engines and real-time communications through the internet become more pervasive. 



Conventional battery rating methods do not address many of the modern applications because system parasitics such as the inductance of the wiring interconnects, and parasitics associated with the detailed operation of a battery have not been sufficiently modeled or are not fully documented or reflected on datasheets. Moreover, battery manufacturers either cannot provide the data or are reluctant to disclose information for fear of releasing trade secrets. Unfortunately for companies such as AEG that are building critical subassemblies for solar farms and server farms there is no guidance as to how to design or rate energy storage devices within a system context. This implies that a design methodology for selecting and rating energy storage components, as driven by the application, is lacking. 



This research project addresses this technology gap by developing a design methodology that will allow companies such as AEG to select and rate a single or hybrid energy storage device. There is also a recognition that other means of storing energy are possible. Therefore, a secondary objective of this project is to explore new approaches of storing energy at the molecular level, by non-electrochemical means, and perhaps achieve 100 times the energy density of existing state-of-the art battery technologies.

"Pulsed plasma sources that generate intense infrared, visible and ultra-violet radiation are finding increased use in the semiconductor industry and for pathogenic neutralization. Existing circuits that are used to convert pulsed electrical energy into radiation are inefficient; less than 10% of the electrical energy supplied to the plasma is converted into useful radiation under worst case conditions. Poor energy conversion efficiency implies a high demand for energy, high operating costs, and a large amount of green house gases due to the high demand for energy.



This objective of this research project is to redesign the energy conversion circuit to maximize the amount of energy converted into useful radiation. The use of modern computational tools and a detailed model will minimize the need for extensive experimental investigations, which are costly and time consuming. A set of experimental findings will be used to validate the detailed model of the plasma. A novel means of generating a simplified model of the plasma will be developed from the detailed model. The simplified model will be used to develop pulsed power conversion circuits with higher efficiency and to reduce the time-to market for new designs.



The methodology for developing the simplified model and optimizing the energy conversion efficiency will be tested on the following two applications; a light source that is used for flash annealing in the semiconductor industry and a light source that is used for pathogenic neutralization.

"Actin is the most abundant protein in our bodies.  It is found in all our muscles, forming part of the machinery that converts the chemical energy from food into the mechanical energy of movement.  But actin does more than just work in muscles; it is also found in every cell in our bodies, forming a network of filaments called the cytoskeleton that is a structural support for the cells.

   The most important property of the actin protein is that it will self-assemble into long polymers or filaments that we call F-actin.  These protein filaments are what give the cytoskeleton its structural strength and provide muscles with ""tracks"" for motor proteins to run on and generate movement.

   Despite the importance of actin filaments in biology, we still do not understand the molecular basis for the formation, use, and governance of actin filaments in cells.  We would like to have atomic-resolution three-dimensional structures of actin filaments to understand how the actin subunits are arranged and interact, and how they change their form over the lifetime of actin filaments.  But the technique we use to obtain such pictures, X-ray crystallography, doesn't work very well with actin filaments - we need short proteins of exactly the same size.  Therefore, my lab has produced short F-actin complexes of defined length for structural work.

   In the past, efforts to achieve this goal have sacrificed F-actin interactions to get F-actin complexes all the same size.  I believe that we have solved this problem:  we will use a mild treatment of our short F-actin complexes that will retain F-actin interactions while keeping our complexes all the same size so we can use X-ray crystallography. We need to study the biochemical properties of the complexes we produce to make sure that our actin complexes retain F-actin structure.  This way, we will know that our short F-actin complexes have F-actin-like characteristics before doing structural studies.

   Understanding F-actin at the atomic level will be a milestone in muscle research and our knowledge of the cytoskeleton:  two areas that are critical for life.

"Cognitive science adopts the tri-level hypothesis, which directs researchers to address three different questions about cognition: what information processing problem is being solved?  What information processing steps are required to solve the problem?  What specific mechanisms are required to execute these information processing steps?  The tri-level hypothesis has also been applied to associative learning, which attempts to explain how we remember relationships between ideas and events.  Shanks has argued that the implementational question about associative learning is answered by artificial neural networks, which are computer simulations of brain-like information processing.



The proposed research is partly motivated by a concern with Shanks' position: my previous research has shown that artificial neural networks do not merely provide implementational answers.  Rather, artificial neural networks provide insights at both the computational and at the algorithmic levels.  Recently, I have used artificial neural networks to study a simple form of associative learning called classical or Pavlovian conditioning.  This work - which involved both formal proofs and computer simulations of learning experiments - revealed a number of fundamental issues about the relationship between artificial neural networks and associative learning.  My future research will extend this research paradigm to deal with more complex forms of learning - the learning of the contingencies between events, and to associative learning in general.  I expect that my work on artificial neural networks will lead to new theories of associative learning, and will clarify the theoretical and empirical relationships between networks and theories of association.","Computer software","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences"

"Infectious diseases remain one of the most significant threats to human health despite an enormous amount of research in medicine over the past fifty years. Many pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., antibiotics & vaccines) have been developed to slow or stop the spread of disease, but it is now abundantly clear that pathogen evolution often renders these tools ineffective. This has led to the emergence of Evolutionary Epidemiology as a leading new field of study, in which concepts from evolutionary biology are applied to the study of infectious diseases. 

      

     In our research we develop and test mathematical models of pathogen evolution to better understand disease. Our current research has two main components. First, we are developing models to explain patterns of disease life history evolution, and how this is affected by interventions such as vaccination (a disease's life history is its temporal pattern of transmission and mortality/morbidity during an infection). This theory will then be tested experimentally in the lab, using a species of malaria specific to mice. Second, we are developing models to explore how pathogen evolution, and its interaction with host populations, can cause individuals to mount immunological responses to their own tissue. This is referred to as autoimmune disease, and our hope is that principles from evolutionary biology will give us a more complete understanding of this important form of disease.



     Over the five-year period of this research, eight graduate students, five undergraduates, and one technician will receive high-level training in the use of mathematics for addressing important biological and epidemiological issues.

"DHC is a thermally activated 'slow-cracking' mechanism, occurring in Zr-2.5Nb CANDU pressure tubes when hydrogen (deuterium) is found above a critical concentration, diffuses to stress concentrations at a crack tip (or other stress concentrater) and precipitates as hydrides.  When these brittle hydrides are large enough, they crack, the crack propagates and arrests at the ductile matrix and the process repeats.  

Above temperatures of around 200�C the DHC mechanism is reasonably well understood, with observed hydride characteristics and crack velocity in good agreement with model predictions.  However, at temperatures below 200�C there is a transition in the DHC behaviour, which is not well understood.  Specifically, below ~200�C cracks can be initiated without thermal cycling, and even during heat up; while in the regime above 200�C, it is known that cracks initiate only after cool down.  Further, the crack velocity at these lower temperatures is observed to be somewhat higher than would be expected based on extrapolation of data from above 200�C.  This may be associated with a phase change in the hydrides (observed at 150-180�C).  

The project addresses the low temperature (i.e. <200�C) formation of hydrides, and in particular the occurrence of DHC during heat up.  We will carry out a series of experiments on typical pressure tube microstructure material, for different hydrogen concentrations, stresses, heating rates, dwell temperatures and times.

"The overall theme of the proposed research is in improving our understanding of the deformation characteristics of metal alloys during fatigue and failure in two ways. Firstly prior to crack initiation, the average response of the material is studied with the goal of finding out how energy and deformation is distributed according to microstructure. Secondly subsequent to crack initiation the way that stresses are relieved in the one close to short fatigue cracks is considered. In particular we investigate the role of local crystallographic properties on how the crack will propagate.  Such research will lead to improved failure prediction methodologies, with application in the aerospace, automotive and power generation industries.  A better understanding of failure leads both to improved safety and economic gains since repairs and replacements can be carried out on a less conservative schedule.","Materials sciences","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng."

"Learning to spell is a particularly challenging cognitive activity. This is in part because spelling in English is based on several levels of regularities that connect spoken language to print on the page. Consider the classic example of spelling of the word magician; its letters roughly reflect the word's component sounds, but they also reflect its units of meaning (e.g., c is used to represent the 'sh' sound in order to retain the root magic). Currently, we do not understand how it is that children develop sophisticated knowledge of the representation of units of meaning, or morphemes, in spelling, and yet it is clear that they are sensitive to the morphemic structure of word spellings at an early age. The set of studies outlined here will test a new theoretical account of how this might happen, in which I apply the ideas of statistical learning to spelling development Statistical learning is a concept that, over the last decade, has revolutionised the study of child development, and the time is ripe for its application to spelling development. In brief, I argue that children learn about the basis of spelling by attending to the frequency with which letters, sounds and meaning co-occur. For example, children might learn to represent plurality with the letter -s (as in the word final -s in dogs) through their experience of the simultaneous occurrence of the letter -s, the concept of plurality and the sound /z/ or /s/, rather than by learning a rule specifying that ""all plurals are spelled with -s"". The experiments described here will examine whether statistical learning of these co-occurrences can account for the timing and mechanisms of spelling development. The experiments provide an important test of the nature of statistical learning and, at the same time, they will assess the plausibility of a much-needed new model of spelling development.

"Since the advent of models for entangled polymers based on the concept of a ""molecule in a tube"", pioneered by Doi and Edwards, there has been a steady advance in our ability to make quantitative predictions of the rheological behavior of molten polymers of known molecular structure. Originally developed for linear, monodisperse polymers, the Doi-Edward theory has been elaborated to deal with polydisperse linear polymers and monodisperse, branched systems. There has also been some progress in the modeling of branched systems with a limited degree of polydispersity. A final barrier to the use of these mean-field molecular theories to describe polymers of industrial importance is the lack of a reliable model for broadly polydisperse branched polymers having at least two branch points per molecule. Prof. R. G. Larson of the University of Michigan has developed a hierarchical approach to this problem, and it is now proposed to incorporate this model into an algorithm capable of predicting the rheological behavior of branched polymer having polydispersity in the lengths of the branches. The predictions will be compared with data for samples having branching structures and polydispersities that are precisely known. Next, an accurate rheological characterization of the samples will be carried out, the data will be compared with the predictions of the model, and any deficiencies that become apparent will be addressed. The successful completion of the project will provide information of interest to polymer scientists as well as companies wishing to develop new polymer structures for specific applications. It will also be of interest to examine how the model might be used to infer molecular structure from rheological data.","Polymers, rubber and plastics","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng."

"This proposal develops efficient methods for the design of clinical studies that monitor recurrent events, for example, skin or other cancer recurrences or epileptic seizures. Sometimes continuous monitoring of individuals experiencing recurrent events is not possible or imperative. There may be situations where, ethically, patients need not be subjected to such monitoring based on the need for care, and at the same time, funds spent in continuous or overly-frequent monitoring could be better allocated; alternatively, events may occur too frequently for their exact times of occurrence to be recorded. Statistical challenges to the design of studies that monitor recurrent events lie in determining optimal times for followup and the number of followup times  required, accounting for the numerous distinctions that characterize studies of human subjects, for example, substantial heterogeneity in responses to treatments amongst individuals and missingness of data. The methods employed by the proposed research afford minimal assumptions on the underlying process that generates recurrences, making them highly generalizable.





The proposal also considers methods for mapping disease or mortality rates. Maps such as these are important for epidemiological research, to suggest factors which may be linked to mortality, and in health policy, where they provide an overall description of mortality and are used to allocate health funding. The strength of the methods developed is their capacity to take into account the spatial arrangement of the regions and any correlations which exist because of such configurations. They isolate time trends that manifest at the broad regional level as well as the small-area level, thus permitting an overall provincial and localized policy impact.

"My long term goal is the discovery of techniques that increase the correctness and reliability of software systems through the use of grammar programming, software transformation and software architecture understanding. While progress in these techniques will have the effect of reducing the cost of maintenance of software systems, the main objective is to reduce the errors, and therefore the risk, introduced by human effort. One of the ways we can reduce errors and risk is by reducing repetitive tasks and concentrating the human effort on those tasks that requires human ingenuity and creativity.

     The first part of my research addresses the evolution of web applications. Companies and organizations have invested heavily in on-line systems and as the technology advances, they are faced with the daunting task of migrating their existing systems. This research will take the migration to AJAX based web applications as the exemplar migration task and investigate the techniques needed to assist the migration and can be applied to other migrations. One of the open questions is the extent to which the task is automatable and how much intervention is required.

     The second part of my research addresses the security and robustness of network applications.  This research investigates techniques that can be used as part of quality assurance by a software developer or by a customer as part of acceptance testing.  Our approach is unique in that we consider the network protocol as a programming language and can draw on twenty years of existing program comprehension research which we can apply to the security testing problem.

     Software plays an increasingly important role in our lives. My grandfather's salary was paid in cash, my father was paid by cheque and I am paid by direct deposit to my bank account. Software applications cannot be safe or secure if the technology on which it rests is not secure or reliable.

"Infectious diseases are of great importance across society. Epidemic outbreaks of diseases such as measles, SARS, influenza or foot-and-mouth disease, can pose direct threats to public health and/or have serious economic effects. In order to control such diseases, it is vital to understand how the disease spreads geographically over time, and what factors lead to some individuals becoming infected, and some not. To this end, a new class of mathematical models,  individual-level models (ILMs) for infectious diseases, has been developed. These models are intuitive, flexible, and have been shown to accurately describe the patterns of previously observed epidemics over space and time. However, ILMs are relatively new and so there are many infectious disease problems for which specific models do not yet exist.

    A process known as statistical inference is used to derive a model that best fits the observed data. Computationally intensive techniques are used to carry out this process. However, these intensive techniques can take a long time to run if we have a lot of data, or lots of missing values in the data which we wish to estimate; both are often the case with disease epidemics.

    The purpose of this research is therefore to do the following: 1) extend ILMs so they can model more infectious diseases, more accurately; 2) improve the statistical inference process to make it more efficient; 3) apply new models to data collected about various infectious diseases to answer biologically interesting questions about those diseases (e.g. ""who are most at risk from the disease?"" or ""how do we best control this disease?""); 4) use computer simulation and inference to determine what sort of infectious disease data should be collected in the future to provide information most efficiently about the infection process; and 5) develop computer software that non-statisticians can use easily.

    These developments can then be used to further our understanding of infectious diseases, and through this, our ability to control them or alleviate unnecessarily severe outcomes.

"In the coming years, information technology will continue to transform the way we think, work, communicate, and learn. The tremendous success of Internet-related technologies (web services, voice over IP, mobile telephony, etc.) coupled with advances both in hardware and software will invigorate the existing proliferation of software intensive systems. This will allow for new services, applications and systems that will recede increasingly into the background of our lives. In this setting, the secure engineering of such software-intensive systems becomes a major concern. This is emphasized by the fact that security breaches of software systems keep appearing at an alarming rate in spite of numerous updates and patches that are constantly being issued. The primary intent of this research is to contribute to the secure engineering of software-intensive systems. To this end, we envision extending current Model Driven Architecture (MDA) paradigms and prominent modern modeling languages, such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), in order to address security concerns throughout the development lifecycle. This choice is motivated by the wide acceptance of these methods in industry and academia due to their expressiveness, easiness and tool support. In this research, the targeted security concerns are: capturing security requirements, specification and design of security mechanisms, verification and validation of security properties/policies, and automatic generation of secure code. Appropriate security profiles and UML language extensions  will be used in the capture of  security requirements as well as the specification and design of security solutions. For the purpose of verification and validation, we will automatically  derive new semantic models from UML specifications and subject them to verification techniques against a-priori defined security policies. A significant objective of this research is to systematically generate secure code from the extended design models using aspect oriented programming techniques. Finally, we intend to leverage the obtained research results to the de facto language for system engineering i.e. System Modeling Language (SysML).

However the production of prototypes is expensive. This project will use computer simulations and other theoretical methods to study how the magnetic properties of films are modified by such structural modification. The fundamental understanding of this relationship between microscopic structure and macroscopic properties will contribute to our ability to predict how structural modification can be used to generate novel and desirable characteristics of the magnetic film. In the later stages of this work structural modification of other technologically important materials, such as polymers, will also be considered.

"Following exposition to various conditions like spaceflights, high altitude expeditions, prolonged immobilization and chronic inflammatory diseases, muscle mass is significantly decreasing. In these conditions, contractile protein degradation is present and represents an important problem in leaving organisms because muscle mass reduction diminishes significantly their motor performances and impair several essential physiological functions. Understanding cellular signaling involve in the initiation and the development of muscle atrophy is necessary to develop efficient tools aimed at stopping or slowing down this process in affected organisms. Hypoxia is suspected to take part in the development of muscle protein degradation since humans and animals exposed to low oxygen concentration suffer from body weight loss including muscle mass. Our preliminary works have confirmed that muscle cells exposed to hypoxic conditions have increased mRNA expression of Atrogin-1 and accumulation of actin fragment, an indirect marker of proteolysis suggesting that hypoxia might be involved in muscle proteolysis development. In this research program, we propose to study, in muscle cells and in animals, the biochemical signaling that integrates the hypoxic signal into a coordinated proteolytic response. Concretely, we plan to test the hypothesis that hypoxia, through the production of inflammatory cytokines, alters the activity of the IGF/PI3K/Akt path, a pathway involved in protein synthesis, in favor of the FOXO/Atrogin-1/proteasome path, a pathway involved in protein degradation.

"Zoocentric models of patch occupancy and between-patch movement have offered important insights on animal-landscape interactions. By comparison, plants response to changes in landscape structure that arise from habitat loss and fragmentation has been less considered, even though plants are also submitted to increasing pressures from land-use changes with negative consequences for global plant diversity. I therefore aim to understand the interrelation among landscape structure, habitat conditions, and key biological processes, such as reproduction and dispersal, which determines the persistence of spatially-structured plant populations and communities. I focus on linear habitat corridors that presumably provide connectivity in landscape models, using two systems: 1) native forest herbs of conservation interest dispersing into hedgerow corridors connected to forest patches, and 2) linear wetlands (drainage ditch, canals, etc) into which an invasive plant, Phragmites australis, aggressively disperses, possibly facilitating invasion of natural wetlands. I will address three specific issues relevant to the assessment of corridor function in these systems. First, I will measure the influence of spatial constraints on pollen flow on the reproductive success of Trillium populations in hedgerow corridors and forests. Second, I will evaluate the relevance of assembly theory in explaining forest herb community patterns in hedgerow corridors. Third, I will assess whether the inclusion of landscape structure in a model significantly improves our ability to predict the distribution of the native and exotic genotypes of Phragmites at the landscape scale. Results from these studies are expected to bring new insights into corridor functions that are assumed to be important for the conservation of biodiversity, especially in intensively managed landscapes, but that are rarely tested, especially for plants. These studies will also help provide spatially-explicit information for the management of invasive plant species.

"The myelin is a multi-layered membrane that ensheathes the axon, enabling rapid transmission of the nerve impulse. Within the myelin membrane there are unique regions or microdomains that are functional entities necessary for proper myelin development and maintenance. The common structural components of microdomains are less-fluid lipids, such as glycosphingolipids and cholesterol. The different types of microdomains vary in their affinity for certain classes of proteins.  A specific type of microdomains, lipid rafts are found in most cellular membranes and are enriched in lipid-anchored proteins. Although caveolae have been observed as flask-shaped invaginations in the membrane, this particular microdomain has not been found in myelin or the myelin-producing cells. Other the myelin microdomains such as caveolin-enriched microdomains, gap junctions, and the radial component may be involving in complex signaling networks. To determine the roles of the various microdomains in myelin, it is necessary to separate each type from the bulk membrane and characterize their proteome. With differential extractions techniques we will isolate each microdomain, and with 2D gel electrophoresis and multi-dimensional protein identification analysis we will determine the protein composition. The further analysis of multi-protein complexes will suggest specific functional roles in the development and maintenance of the myelin sheath. From this knowledge we can investigate the remodeling of myelin microdomains in various diseases and disorders of CNS ""white matter"" such as multiple sclerosis or adrenoleukodystropy, and determine molecular targets which can be used in therapeutic strategies.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Cell Biology"

"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) is the causative agent of Johne's disease (JD), a debilitating chronic gastroenteritis in ruminants. JD has a great economic impact in dairy cattle due to premature culling, reduced carcass value and decreased milk production. There is also a growing concern about the association of Map with Crohn's disease. With no available cure for JD and hampered control programs, there is an urgent need to improve diagnostic tools by the identification and characterization of the bacterial components involved in the pathogenesis and the host immune response. We have identified two protein families in Map, the PE and PPE proteins, which are promising candidates in this respect. Those families are unique to Mycobacteria and are highly expanded in the pathogenic members of this genus. In M. tuberculosis (Mtb), they are implicated as virulence factors and known to be immunostimulatory during infection. Some of the Mtb PE/PPE proteins are expressed on the cell surface and are suggested to provide the antigenic variation that could lead to immune evasion. There are 10 PE and 37 PPE genes in Map, comprising 1% of the genome, but their potential role in JD has never been studied. The hypothesis of the proposed studies is that some PPE proteins of Map are surface exposed by binding to the cell wall where they interact with host cells to promote infection. We have recently discovered four PPE proteins of Map to be surface exposed on the cell wall in vitro. We will further study the subcellular localization of the PPE proteins in Map since this is suggestive of their function. We will gain a better understanding of their role in infection by analyzing the expression of the PPE proteins after ingestion of Map cells by macrophages and invasion in epithelial cells. We will study the putative complex formation between PE and PPE proteins and identify other protein-protein interactions of the PPE proteins with host proteins, cells and tissues. Finally, we will investigate the specific interactions of the PPE proteins with the cell wall. We anticipate that the discovery of the function(s) and interactions of the PE and PPE proteins of Map will have a great impact on the understanding of the pathogenesis of JD.

"T lymphocytes are major players in the immune defense of vertebrates against viruses. Lymphocyte specificity  is given by receptor molecules that recognize antigenic peptides loaded onto specialized ligand proteins on the  surface of target cells. The lymphocyte/target interface, which is known as the immunological synapse,  undergoes a dramatic organization during antigen-specific activation leading to the clustering of the antigen  receptor and associated molecules on one side and their respective ligands on the other.

The experimental work proposed here will help us to better understand the formation of the immunological synapse and the triggering of the immune cell function.

"This application is for a new scintillation counter, which is a machine that measures radioactivity in small samples of biological tissues or other materials. We need this to replace an aging counter that we purchased in 1984, which now has very reduced sensitivity and multiple mechanical problems. We are using this to trace tritiated (3H-) steroids between individuals. We are examining the possibility that steroid hormones such as estradiol, the most powerful estrogen, not only act within individuals but also pass between individuals. We have found that estradiol and other small steroids are excreted by adult male mice and other mammals. This is associated with two well-known pheromonal effects: 1) the loss of pregnancy in females caused by contact with unfamiliar adult males, and 2) early puberty in juvenile females exposed to unfamiliar adult males. These effects can both be mimicked by injecting females with estradiol. We are conducting experiments with mice where we trace 3H-estradiol from males' systems into their urine and other excretions, then measure this 3H-estradiol in the uterus and brain of nearby females. This is very meaningful given evidence that small elevations of estradiol in the uterus can disturb early pregnancy. Furthermore, estradiol promotes puberty, as growth of the uterus is naturally driven by estradiol and female sexual behaviour is naturally stimulated by the actions of estradiol in the hypothalamus of the brain. Accordingly, this new scintillation counter is critical for our research identifying the chemical nature of important reproductive pheromones. A new scintillation counter will also help this laboratory's ability to measure steroids in blood, urine, and other media, as it will allow us to use sensitive radioimmunoassay procedures. This counter is critical for the continuation of the research of students already in the laboratory, and it will help future students to conduct innovative research in pheromone dynamics and endocrine disruption. It will help to ensure that this laboratory remains competitive, making substantial contributions to basic reproductive science and reproductive toxicology.","Advancement of knowledge","Biological Systems and Functions"

"Since non-petroleum fuels are becoming a necessity for gas turbine operators, 2nd generation biofuels are in development and need to be evaluated for wide spread use in the coming years. Combustion in gas turbine combustors is very complex with many strongly coupled variables interacting to prepare the fuel air mixture in limited space with very stringent emission standards. Hence existing design tools to devise a combustor are very specific to properties of fuels in use. Analytical correlations paired with simulations are the design tools used to account for phenomena such as fuel evaporation, mixing and diffusion, the strong turbulent aerodyna- mic flow, the high temperature convective and radiating flow, and the strong chemical reaction with high- energy delivery. Therefore, fuel properties are a critical factor to account for added energy to the flow delivered to the turbine section at high temperature but with a well-defined profile to prevent blade erosion. The most significant challenge in design is to predict for very low emissions that are strongly coupled to reacting tempe- rature. Therefore when a new fuel is used in a gas turbine combustor, all the design tools have to be enhanced to account for changing properties in existing or newly developed gas turbine combustor. The performance and pollutant emissions for biofuelled gas turbine engines can be predicted with better accuracy, using validated combustion models. The objective of this research project is to study the characteristics of novel gas turbine fuels in non-combusting and combusting systems to decouple their interaction with simpler geometries to identify the underlying variables controlling the combustion phenomena and to develop useful correlation models from the experimental or numerical data. For non-combusting systems, fuel sprays will be characteri- zed with advanced laser techniques to study the influence of changing fuel properties on droplet formation and the ultimate size distribution fed to the combustor. For the combustion systems, they will vary from simple laminar and turbulent open burners, to complex swirl generic combustors, approaching realistic industrial combustors. This project will also provide feedback to biofuel producers to tailor their products to end users.

"Biological and chemical sensors are widely sought for applications in medical diagnostics, threat detection, and

industrial process control. Furthermore, there is an increasing demand for sensors that are low-cost, mobile,

sensitive, reliable, and provide immediate readout for identification of multiple analytes. Optical sensors have

well-known advantages, including immunity to electromagnetic interference, compatibility with harsh

environments, and the potential for non-destructive analysis of samples. Moreover, optical detection is heavily

favored for lab-on-chip (LOC) systems, and there is recently great interest in chip-scale optical sensors, enabled

by co-integration of microfluidics and integrated optics.

The development of these sensors is currently hindered by the lack of integration of optical detection methods.

To date, most work relies on large-scale and expensive off-chip optical devices such as confocal microscopes

and optical spectrum analyzers. For applications such as point-of-care diagnostics and field-deployable threat

detectors, this has delayed the widespread commercial deployment of LOC techniques.

The main objective of the project is the development and demonstration of an integrated micro-spectrometer

operating in the ~800-1000 nm wavelength band. Based on a novel type of waveguide-coupled, graded

Fabry-Perot cavity, the spectrometer has no moving parts and provides a unique mix of small size, high

resolving power, and wide operational bandwidth. We also believe it is well-suited for integration within LOC

systems. Secondary objectives are to develop and demonstrate prototype systems that exploit the spectrometer,

and thus establish its industrial applicability. In particular, we will apply the device to near-infrared Raman

spectroscopy, which is a particularly promising approach to label-free sensing of molecules.","Biomedical engineering","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"

"Vascular diseases are the first cause of hospitalization in industrialized countries. Their total cost to the Canadian economy is estimated at $19 billion. Current therapies to treat occluded vessels include surgical bypass and autologous grafting, or implantation of intravascular stents. Both polyester fabric (PET, DacronTM) and fluoropolymer membrane (ePTFE, Gore-TexTM) grafts have shown to perform well for grafts of diameter larger than 6 mm. However, no material has been demonstrated to be suitable for small-diameter (< 6 mm) applications because of significant problems associated with compliance mismatch and thrombogenicity. Therefore, replacement of small-diameter vessels is a significant unmet medical need and the focus of this proposal. The main hypotheses, that were partially validate in previous work, of the current project are: Innovative non-woven polymeric structures may display mechanical properties similar to those of small arteries; Smooth muscle cell (SMC) and endothelial cell (EC) growth on these new polymeric structures maybe enhanced by grafting selected bioactive molecules to their surfaces and Appropriate cell coverage of the graft material may totally abrogate unwanted thrombo-inflammatory response. The end-point aim of this project is to develop tissue engineered synthetic arterial vessels from cells grown on functionalized nonwoven fiber structures made of PET or of an hybrid from PET and a bioresorbable polymer. This will require the development of PET or PET/resorbable polymer hybrid structures with mechanical

compliance matching that of a small vascular artery; proper surface modification and functionalization capable of enhancing cell attachment and growth in order to generate hemocompatible, anti-thrombogenic and anti-inflammatory biomaterials. and finally the need that SMC/EC grown on the structures are resistant to pulsatile flow.Our ultimate goal is to bring this new nonwoven fiber grafts close to proof-of-concept for in vivo studies at the end of this project in order to translate the results of this research into clinical outcomes.","Biomedical engineering","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Biomedical Technologies"

"Oxide solutions encompass metallurgical slags, magmas and lavas, many important minerals which make up most of the Earth crust, ceramic materials, glasses, etc. The accurate modeling of various properties of solid and liquid oxide solutions is essential in process simulation for a very wide range of applications including primary metals extraction, glass technology, conventional and functional ceramics, high tech materials, combustion, environmental science, corrosion control, waste management, etc.

   Modeling of oxide solutions is a challenging task. Oxide and particularly silicate solutions are quite extraordinary in their ability to incorporate many different cations by adjusting the structure. Complex oxide solutions often have several sublattices and reveal a strong tendency to inter- and intra-sublattice short-range ordering, which is responsible for specific physical properties. For example, the distribution of cations and defects between different sublattices defines volumetric, electrical and magnetic properties of ceramic phases; short-range ordering strongly affects viscosity and thermodynamic properties of liquid slags. This structural complexity must be reflected in the models. Unless the mathematical model for a particular property is based upon a realistic physical model, interpolations, extrapolations, and predictions have little chance of success.

   The project will involve the development and testing of new models for oxide solutions, and the perfection and validation of existing models, as we encounter a wide variety of solution types. The correlations between different properties will be established with a view to using the structural information obtained from the modeling of one property (particularly from the modeling of thermodynamic properties) to facilitate modeling of other properties.

"In 2001, my NSERC proposal began by stating that the modelling of vast amounts of data, such as text, video, multimedia, gene data and environmental signals, was one of the most demanding challenges of artificial intelligence and statistics in the new century. At the time, I pointed out that to construct appropriate models for the data, we needed to contend with uncertainty as data is typically noisy, imprecise and only partially observed. This uncertainty, coupled with the sheer magnitude of the problem, precluded the construction of models using knowledge acquired solely from experts. To overcome these problems, I proposed the use of probabilistic learning techniques and Monte Carlo algorithms to infer the models automatically from data.



Despite great progress in the fields of machine learning and statistics over the last five years, the data modelling challenge has grown. Many researchers and companies, including Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Yahoo, have an increasing need for more expressive models in their quest to capture more complex structures and relations in the data. With this need comes a demand for faster scalable learning algorithms. Expressive models and efficient algorithms have not only given some of these companies a vital competitive edge, but have also led to advances in many areas of scientific endeavor. For example, in biology, they have enabled us to model increasingly more complex interactions between genes and proteins.



Decision theory has also begun to play a more prominent role in modelling. For example, with vast quantities of data spread over networks, such as the world-wide-web and environmental sensor networks, we require techniques to decide when, how and where to look for information in these networks. To attack this and many other fundamental problems in science and information technology, my research focuses on expanding the frontier of learning algorithms, decision theory and large-scale, structured probabilistic representations.

"The proposed research work is focused on the retrieval of information about the state of the atmosphere. In particular, we develop techniques to measure the global distribution of ozone at unprecedented spatial resolution. We do this through analysis of optical measurements from satellite platforms. There are two equally important aspects to this work. Firstly, tools must be developed to accurately calculate the transmission of radiation through the atmosphere. Secondly, algorithms must be developed to extract atmospheric profiles that best fit the observed optical signal. These retrieval algorithms adjust the state of the atmosphere until there is good agreement between the simulated and measured signals.

My group is currently focused on the analysis of data from the Canadian built OSIRIS instrument. The primary objective of OSIRIS is to produce measurements for the study of chemistry and photochemistry associated with high latitude ozone depletion. The work proposed in this project will greatly enhance the scientific return from OSIRIS and future Canadian Space Agency missions designed to further our knowledge of atmospheric processes. It is our intention to develop a world class suite of radiative transfer models and retrieval techniques to place Canada at the forefront of a worldwide endeavour.

"This proposal runs along two parallel tracks.  



One deals with the construction and properties of quantum mechanical states that have the property of saturating the Heisenberg uncertainty relation.  Such states are called intelligent, and have numerous applications, particularly in optical interferometry.  They also have an important theoretical role in the detection of entanglement, a feature essential to quantum information theory.



A second track deals with complementarity in finite dimensional quantum systems.  Here, the objective is to study the construction of sets of states that describe maximally incompatible preparations of a quantum system.  Such states are useful for the optimal implementation of various protocols of quantum information.  The intention is to consider cases, as in a quantum system of dimenion 6, where the dimension is not a prime number or a power of a prime number.  In the latter cases, sets of complementary states are already known and constructed.

"Invasive species are among the most important anthropogenic components of global change. Shipping has led to a global homogenization of the distribution of species, resulting in catastrophic reduction in native species biodiversity with severe economic consequences. Invasive species have caused large reductions in native species biodiversity on the east and west coasts of Canada and have reduced the sustainability of aquaculture.   We have discovered two species of invasive colonial ascidian tunicates in several harbours on the south coast of Newfoundland. They have not yet attained high densities however, providing the rare opportunity to conduct 'pre-invasion' research and increasing the probability of successful mitigation. Our first objective is to develop TaqMan gene probes and real-time PCR assays, permitting early detection of a single ascidian egg or larva in a plankton sample. These probes will be based upon the nucleotide sequence of the cytochrome oxidase I gene of mitochondrial DNA, a reliable indicator of species identity. The gene probes may be made commercially available in 3-5 years.

   Successful eradication also depends upon knowledge of which mitigation measures to apply and where and when to apply them. Thus, mitigation must be guided by knowledge of the population dynamics of the invader. Our second objective is to conduct an annual investigation of the population growth and recruitment potential of Botryllus schlosseri in Placentia Bay, and the potential reinvasion of Botrylloides violaceus into a mitigation area in Belleoram. We will develop a 'best practices' protocol document, enabling government managers to make more informed decisions about invasive ascidian eradication.

"This research will utilize two high resolution nuclear microprobes, unique instruments that we are building, capable of analyzing materials and modifying them. The first is Canada's first one-micron microprobe. Analogous to an electron microscope, this microprobe will focus a beam of energetic MeV ions to a spot size of one micron - about one hundred times finer than the width of a hair. The nuclear microprobe is unique because the beam undergoes very little lateral scattering, maintaining its small width as it penetrates into the sample. It can identify elements to within a few parts per million. When the focused beam is also collimated and strikes a crystal along one of its main axes or planes, it 'channels' into the crystal, scattering far less frequently and penetrating more deeply into the crystal than it would at a random alignment. Any imperfection in the crystal will cause the beam to scatter when it otherwise wouldn't, opening up the technique of channeling microscopy, which uses dechanneling to study strain and defects in crystals. Strain and defects can be present at any depth below the surface of a semiconducting device, and both have strong effects on the electronic properties of semiconductors. Electron microscopes are limited to surface studies, and optical microscopes cannot penetrate below metallization layers. The nuclear microscope is therefore truly unique in its ability to probe with high resolution to depths of several dozen microns below a device's surface. We will use channeling to further study graded SiGe/Si crystals. These have the ability to bend and extract proton beams of roughly 200 MeV used for proton irradiation of cancer tumors, and could substantially reduce the costs involved in running medical accelerators. The new microprobe will also be used to apply the new technique of maskless patterning of silicon to produce porous silicon light-emitting devices. This technique could allow the integration of microelectronics and optoelectronics (usually made in III-V semiconductors) onto a single silicon chip. We are also constructing an external beamline, which will allow us to analyze large objects such as paintings, archaeological artifacts, and other items which are large or unsuitable for vacuum.","Materials sciences","Condensed Matter Physics"

"Modern day crop protection relies heavily on the use of chemical pesticides.  Increasing public concern over the risk these chemicals pose to the environment and human health has led to a search for a safer alternatives. Some bacteria naturally present in soil are able to inhibit the ability of fungi to cause disease in plants. As these bacteria do not cause disease in humans or other animals, they are an environmentally friendly alternative to chemical pesticides.  Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a fungus that causes devastating losses in canola as well as over 400 other crop species.  Two bacteria have been isolated from the environment, Pseudomonas chlororaphis strain PA23 and Pseudomonas sp. DF41 that are able to control the growth of this fungus and protect canola from disease. Unfortunately in the past, commercial use of bacteria to manage crop diseases has met with limited success.  This is most likely due to fluctuations in environmental conditions, which cause variations in the amount of antifungal products produced by the beneficial bacteria.  Strains PA23 and DF41 produce antibiotics and enzymes that control fungal growth, and therefore disease.  Our research is focused on understanding how genes responsible for disease control (biocontrol) are regulated.  We will investigate how a new regulator of gene expression, called PtrA, controls production of antibiotics and enzymes in PA23 and DF41.  In addition, we will look at the manner in which these antibiotics are exported outside of the bacterial cell.  The chemical structure of the antibiotic produced by DF41 is currently not known, so we will deduce its structure.  In the environment nutrients are scarce; consequently, we will investigate the impact of limited food availability on expression of genes and products required for disease suppression.  These studies will shed light on how PA23 and DF41 are able to inhibit fungal growth.  This will enable us to use these two bacteria as pesticide alternatives in a consistent and predictable manner.

"This proposal addresses the modification of lignin using an enzymatic approach, and will complement research programs on chemical modification of lignin in progress elsewhere in Canada. The modification of natural polymers such as lignin with enzymes is an environmentally-friendly alternative to the harsher chemical method. Moreover, the specificity of enzymes is exploited as they target specific functional groups on polymer surfaces without destroying the polymer itself. An intensive screening program of wood-decay fungi collected from the Boreal Forest and housed in the Mycological Herbarium at Lakehead University will be conducted to search for enzymes involved in lignin modification (oxidation and hydrolysis reactions).-of particular interest, are enzymes that specifically cleave-off methyl (demethylation) and methoxyl groups (dernethoxylation) from Kraft and steam explosion-derived lignins. To our knowledge, enzymes of this activity type have not yet been described in the scientific literature, although there is evidence that methanol (result of methyl removal) is liberated from lignin by ligninolytic fungi. As lignin is a highly methylated natural polymer, specific enzymes are likely associated with demethylation of lignin. These will be sought through screening. Fungi (and enzyme: activity associated with demethylation of lignin can be assayed by measuring methanol released. The objective of this proposal is to discover and isolate microbial enzymes that can modify lignin through demethylation reactions, and to elucidate this mechanism. The lignin demethylating enzyme(s) will be produced on a large scale, and the physicochemical properties of the crude, as well as in the purified form, characterised as this information is vitally important in downstream studies on the enzymatic modification of lignin. The enzyme(s) will be employed in the demethylation of lignin and conditions optimised, and the demethylated product assessed for reactivity as a substitute for phenol in formaldehyde polymer applications. The overall outcome of

the proposal is to develop a protocol employing enzymes to remove methyl groups from Kraft lignin to increase its reactivity for use in polymer applications, and also to produce biomethanol as a by-product.

"The Oil Sands is a Canadian national asset.  Production of synthetic crude oil from the Oil Sands involves the use of water to separate the oil from the sand.  The oil can then be recovered from the water.  Although the separation of oil and water sounds simple enough, the oil from the Oil Sands contain some compounds that are able to dissolve in the water.  The water effluent from Oil Sands extraction therefore has to be processed further to clean it before it can be returned to the environment.



The research project ""Reactive organics recovery from oil sands water effluent"" has the ultimate aim of cleaning up the wastewater in a more efficient manner and by doing so recovering additional oil from the water.  Rather than relying on only separation, it is proposed to change the nature of the dissolved oil by reaction.  By doing so the oil will loose much of its affinity for the water, which will make recovery of the oil easier.



Some fundamental understanding of how to convert the dissolved oil is lacking.  This shortcoming will be addressed by learning more about oxygenate chemistry and catalysis that is needed to accomplish the task.  Once this fundamental work has been successfully completed it, the necessary knowledge base has been created to consider the engineering aspects necessary for industrial application.

"The calcium ion is a ubiquitous signaling element that is involved in diverse cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, fertilization, secretion, contraction, neurotransmission, gene expression and apoptosis. In response to many cellular stimuli, such as hormones, antigens, neurotransmitters, and during cell contraction, free intracellular calcium rapidly and transiently increases in the form of spikes and waves, which give rise to localized calcium oscillations. The number, duration, amplitude and, particularly, the frequencies of these oscillations encode information about the nature of the external stimuli, which cells must locally decode into specific downstream cellular processes. 

    Our research program is aimed at understanding how cells decode these calcium oscillations. We have discovered that an enzyme called ""CaM kinase II"" (for calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II), can decode the frequencies of calcium oscillations, in vitro. Our specific aims are to determine 1) the mechanistic rules that govern the decoding abilities of this kinase, 2) how molecular partners of this kinase participate in this decoding process, and 3) whether CaM kinase II can actually decode the frequencies of Ca2+ oscillations in cells. 

    Our experimental approaches involve the use of purified CaM kinase II, immobilized in a computer-controlled, pulse-flow device system, that allows us to expose the kinase to calcium oscillations of precise kinetics and desired properties. We will include additional molecular elements in our system to reconstruct and study the molecular machinery that decodes calcium signals. We will also use imaging approaches to monitor live the sensitivity of CaM kinase II to Ca2+ oscillations in vitro and in cells. 

    Our studies will help understanding key elements of the fundamental mechanisms of calcium signaling, which are centrally involved in multiple cellular processes.

"Neurons communicate with each other at specialized sites of contact called synapses. At synapses a neurotransmitter substances is secreted from the ""preysnaptic"" neuron and diffuses a short distance to bind to receptors on the ""postsynaptic"" target, which can be another neuron, a secretory gland or a muscle. Activation of these receptors initiates electrical and/or biochemical events that constitute the inter-neuronal signal.  Transmitter release is a highly regulated process that is controlled by changes in calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration in the presynaptic terminal. Precise control of the timing and regulation of the amount of transmitter that is secreted is needed for neural circuits to process information properly.   To initiate rapid, highly regulated release, Ca2+ enters the presynaptic terminal through Ca2+ channels that are tightly colocalized with vesicles that contain and release the transmitter.  The intimate relationship between Ca2+ influx and vesicle fusion means that Ca2+ channel regulation is an effective way to modulate synaptic connection strength.  As well as driving vesicle fusion directly, Ca2+ acts through a variety of biochemical pathways to modulate the efficacy of transmission.  The majority of neurological and neuromuscular disorders can be traced to dysfunctional synaptic transmission. In many cases normal modulation of neural function such as adaptation to constant stimuli or short and long-term learning and memory are caused by changes in synaptic connection strength. It is therefore important to understand in great detail the processes of synaptic transmission and their regulation in order to understand normal brain function and to rationally design therapeutic strategies to treat neurological disorders.  We use a combination of electrophysiological and fluorescence imaging techniques, including imaging of Ca2+ sensitive dyes and applying snail and spider toxins to block Ca2+ channels to study the relationship between Ca2+ influx and release, to determine the sub-types of Ca2+ channels that are driving release and to elucidate the mechanisms whereby neuromodulatory substances such as serotonin,  and dopamine regulate release through receptors on presynaptic terminals.

"The Canadian pork industry is an important contributor to the Canadian economy.   Farm gate sales are estimated at $3.5 billion per year and the contribution of the pork industry to Canadian exports exceeds $2.8 billion per year.  The extent of swine liquid feeding in North America continues to increase and is largely driven by the availability of expensive liquid co-products from the bio-fuel and food industry.  Already more than 20% of market pigs in Ontario are raised on computerized liquid feeding systems. 

   The overall aim of the proposed research is to further develop liquid feeding technology for pigs in Central North America.  Specific objective are to:  

1. explore manipulation of dietary electrolyte balance and use of enzymes or bacteria to increase usage and nutritional value of co-products; 

2. explore physical aspects of liquid feed delivery to enhance feed intake, gut health and gut development in pigs, and to minimize feed spoilage;

3. quantify overall energy usage, environmental impact, pork quality and gut health associated with liquid feeding diets that contain large amounts of co-products; and

4. extend the positive effects of liquid feeding to conventional dry feeding systems.

   The main benefits of the proposed research are: (1) more extensive use of inexpensive liquid co-products from the food and bio-fuel industries, and (2) better quantification of impact of liquid feeding on total energy needs, the environment, meat quality and gut health.  A modest 1% reduction in feed costs for pigs represents about $2,500,000 per year in Ontario.  The research will contribute to a reduced reliance on corn and other cereal grains as a source of feed energy for pigs, reduced environmental impact of drying or disposal of liquid co-products, and a safe and domestic supply of high quality pork.

"The Canadian pork industry is an important contributor to the Canadian economy.   Farm gate sales are estimated at $3.5 billion per year and the contribution of the pork industry to Canadian exports exceeds $2.8 billion per year.  Export accounts for more than half of Canadian pork production.  For the Canadian pork industry to remain internationally competitive, improvements in pork meat quality are critical and new opportunities for value-added pork products should be explored. The overall aim of proposed research is to develop feeding strategies for cost-effective production of value-added pork products that contain predictable and uniform levels of beneficial ?-3 fatty acids without compromising carcass and meat quality, thereby providing health benefits to the consumer.  Nutrient metabolism studies will be conducted to improve the efficiency of incorporating beneficial ?-3 fatty acids - especially biologically potent eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C20:5?-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6?-3) - into pork products.  A pig performance study will be conducted to evaluate animal productivity and aspects of meat quality in different pork products (loin chops, smoked ham, bacon, sausages), including sensory evaluation using a trained taste panel, from pigs that are exposed to different feeding strategies aimed at maximizing linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3?-3), DHA and EPA content in pork.  Pork products that are enriched with key ?-3 fatty acids, especially biologically potent EPA and DHA, will address the chronic sub-optimal intake of essential fatty acids by Canadians, and provide important health benefits to consumers.  The latter will address directly the high costs of providing health care to Canadians.  Assuming that due the reduced incidence of heart and bone disease or cancer, because of increased consumption of beneficial ?-3 fatty acids, health care costs in Canada are reduced by 0.01%, then this represents annual savings of at least $12 million to Canadian society.  An improved understanding of diet effects on the conversion of ingested linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3?-3) to EPA and DHA can have implications for recommended use of ALA from a wide range of dietary sources by Canadians.

"The Canadian pork industry is an important contributor to the Canadian economy.   Farm gate sales are estimated at $3.5 billion per year and the contribution of the pork industry to Canadian exports exceeds $2.8 billion per year.  A profitable and sustainable pork industry is thus important to the national economy and to provide consistent, safe and high quality food to Canadians.  An important determinant of pork production efficiency, nutrient losses into the environment, and pork meat quality is the health status of pigs on commercial farms.  In spite of strict bio-security measures, we are still faced with serious sub-clinical disease challenges on commercial swine operations in Canada.  A potentially important means to minimize the negative impact of immune system stimulation, due to disease, is the fortification of swine diets with nutrients at levels exceeding recommendations that have been established in pigs that are managed in a minimum-disease environment.  The overall aim of the proposed research is to establish whether the supply of additional dietary methionine, cysteine and tryptophan will reduce the negative impact of immune system stimulation on nutrient utilization in growing pigs, and to explore the metabolic fate of these amino acids during immune system stimulation.   Nutrient balance and metabolism studies will be conducted to quantify interactive effects of immune system stimulation and intake of these amino acids on digestive function, nitrogen and sulfur retention in the pig's body, nutrient losses into the environment, and production of proteins and metabolites that are involved in the animal's immune response.  By minimizing the negative impact of immune system stimulation on nutrient utilization and animal productivity, and by more closely meeting the pigs' nutrient requirements, the economic losses and environmental impact can be reduced.  Moreover, the use in-feed antibiotics can be reduced, which will further enhance pork meat safety.  The concepts that are explored in the proposed research have direct implications for human health as well, in particular towards the development of recommended intakes of key essential amino acids during an immune challenge.","Animal production and animal primary products","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"
"The overall aim of the proposed research is to better understand the impact of enteric fermentation in the upper gut of mono-gastric animals and humans, on utilization of dietary amino acid (AA) intake for body protein deposition and body maintenance functions. It is hypothesized that enteric microbes (1) contribute to the catabolism of dietary and endogenous AA in the upper gut of mono-gastric animals and humans, and (2) preferentially use preformed AA for the synthesis of microbial protein, even when the host is fed a low protein diet.  These hypotheses imply that microbial fermentation in the upper gut contributes substantially to dietary AA requirements in mono-gastric animals and humans.  Isotope tracer studies will be conducted to quantify key aspects of AA metabolism in intestinal tissue and enteric microbes, as well as protein digestion in growing pigs. These studies will be complemented with proteomics and transcriptomics to identify and characterize diet effects on mucosal protein profiles and regulation of synthesis of mucosal proteins. The proposed research will yield quantitative estimates of the contribution of microbial fermentation in the upper gut of growing pigs to AA catabolism and net AA supply to the host animal.  These estimates will be used to further develop our biology-based, mathematical model that represents nutrient utilization for growth in the pig and that is used to assess the economic and environmental impacts of alternative feeding strategies growing pigs, teach principles of nutrient utilization in education programs, and to explore areas where further research is needed.  Improvements in the efficiency of dietary N utilization will reduce the contribution of pigs to environmental degradation and reduce feeding costs associated with protein. Feed, in turn, represents at least 50% of the cost of pork production. The proposed research will provide an excellent opportunity for training two Ph. D. students and further training of a post-doctoral fellow. The findings have applications for the nutrition of all mono-gastric farm animals and humans.","Animal production and animal primary products","Integrative Animal Biology"

"This project has two separate but related research thrusts.  The first thrust explores the development of an accurate cell phone-based localization system for areas where the Global Positioning System (GPS) does not work well, such as indoors or or in outdoor areas with limited view of the sky.  Together with GPS, cell phone-based localization will provide pervasive localization on a single easy-to-carry device - the mobile phone.  Pervasive localization will be  a catalyst for location-aware applications, such as location-aware web search  and recommendation systems, and will assist in locating 911 calls where accurate location information can make the difference between life and death.   



The second thrust will leverage our localization infrastructure to support location-aware mobile data access. Services that push information to mobile users located within a certain radius of places of interest already exist. However, in these existing services, there is largely no control over when, or if, the data of interest is received on the mobile device. For example, the data may arrive when the mobile user is already heading away from the area of potential interest, and is thus useless to the user. In our work, we will leverage our accurate localization system to enhance information broadcast services with awareness of data utility for the mobile user. Specifically, our proposed data access methods will improve on these existing services by estimating a soft deadline for the usefulness of the information to the user.  The user can also specify a utility of data as a function of its arrival time for certain data of interest. The service can then use the specified client utilities for data items to schedule updates that maximize data usability based on the users' requirements and expectations.","Computer software","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"
"Pervasive computing embeds communications and computation into the environment to enable people to interact with information anywhere and at any time. We will research the use of radio fingerprinting of ambient WiFi and mobile phone networks to address two key challenges in pervasive computing: (i) enabling secure spontaneous communication between devices in close proximity; and (ii) enabling accurate indoor localization.

   Radio fingerprinting is a technique that records characteristics of the radio environment at a given location, such as the signal strengths of a group of radio sources that are heard at a specific location. This proposal takes advantage of two key observations about the nature of radio fingerprints. First, due to environmental factors, the radio fingerprint perceived by a mobile device at a given location varies randomly over time. Second, while the fingerprint at a given location fluctuates over time, the difference between fingerprints taken at locations that are a few meters apart is much larger. This proposal takes advantage of the first observation to enable secure spontaneous communication between devices in close proximity by deriving a shared secret from time and location specific fluctuations of the  radio channel,  and exploits the second observation to enable accurate indoor localization.

   Secure spontaneous communication will make possible a wide range of applications, such as enabling consumers to use their cell phones to pay for groceries at a store or tickets at a train station. It will also make it easier for a user to take advantage of pervasive technology available in the environment by, for example, allowing a user to pair her mobile phone to a public full-sized display and keyboard. Accurate indoor localization will make possible applications such as in-building navigation and coordination between peers, and will be a catalyst for location-based services, such as recommendation systems and location-based search. Finally, it will assist in locating 911 calls where accurate location information can make the difference between life and death.

"The goal of the present study is to develop new product quantification approaches for syngas and tars obtained from biomass catalytic gasification. The laboratory scale and analytical equipments to be used will allow quantitative assessments of syngas components and tar species using GC-MS with FID and TCD detectors, packed and capillary columns.  A number of capillary columns with different polarities will be characterized and studied to separate tar components, such as oxygenates and aromatics, determining adsorption parameters, retention times and statistical moments of different order. This will provide to the partner company of this CRD research, Mandel Scientific, a competitive and scientific advantage, establishing a niche market for their GC-MS-capillary column instruments for biomass gasification product analysis. Furthermore, in order to perform these experiments in realistic scenarios that simulate industrial conditions, catalysts as well as kinetic models for catalytic gasification of biomass will be studied under relevant process conditions. The ultimate goal of these new catalysts will be to optimize H2/CO ratios for alcohol production (e.g. ethanol), with minimum coke and tar formation and for long term catalyst stability. To accomplish this, we propose to consider nickel based catalysts modified with dopants and kinetic models accounting for adsorption, diffusion and reaction phenomena. Kinetics will be established using data from the advanced analytical equipment developed in collaboration with Mandel.

"Proteins are biological macromolecules that are polymers of amino acid residues that are the building blocks of protein; these polymers are called polypeptide chains. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze biological reactions. Metabolic pathways involve the conversion of biological molecules into other useful biological molecules; enzymes catalyze the chemical reactions that are involved in these conversions of molecules. The citric acid cycle is a key pathway in many organisms; this pathway is used to produce molecules that provide energy for a cell to live as well as to produce molecules for other metabolic pathways. One of the key reactions in the citric acid cycle is the conversion of a molecule of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate and carbon dioxide; an enzyme called isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) catalyzes this reaction. During this reaction a helper molecule called a coenzyme is also used. Active sites of enzymes are the places where specific molecules bind and are converted into products. Proteins can consist of one or more polypeptide chains that interact with each other. Normally IDH enzymes consist of two identical polypeptide chains with the active site formed at the place where these two chains interact. The place where these reactions occur is called the active site, which has been identified by the method of x-ray crystallography. A new form of IDH was discovered and this form consists of a single polypeptide chain that is approximately twice the size of the normal form of IDH. Our laboratory was the first to crystallize this new IDH. It is proposed to use the method of x-ray crystallography to determine the structure of the active site of this novel IDH, in order to understand how this enzyme catalyzes this important reaction, and to relate the new form to the normal form of IDH.

"The planets beckon.  Robotics play and will continue to play a central role in planetary exploration.  They will precede us to Mars and will, in a very literal sense, pave the way for our return to the Moon.  Robots are currently our surrogate explorers but they will eventually become our companions as we begin to take steps farther into the Solar System.  Robot colonies will be required for resource utilization in situ and to construct habitats on alien soil.  But the robots must be robust, autonomous and ""intelligent.""  Herein lies the great challenge not just for space robotics but robotics in general.

     The proposed research program is specifically aimed at multiagent robotic systems.  The work is very multidisciplinary, drawing on engineering, computer science, physics, biology and philosophy.  The goal of this project is to advance the understanding of the dynamics of multiagent systems and to develop biologically based (biomimetic) methods of control and self-organization in robotics.

     In particular, the development of what we call an ""artificial neural tissue"" (ANT) is proposed.  We see this work as establishing a new paradigm for robotic control.  The objectives for the ANT architecture is to enable spatial differentiation observed in biological brains that accounts for specialization, to demonstrate the emergence of intelligence from interaction with the real world and to embody the concept and evaluate its performance on real robots.  Artificial evolutionary approaches and artificial developmental biology will characterize the tack taken in this work.  Cellular automata will also be used to study multiagent interactions and self-organization.  While the proposed research will target planetary-exploration applications, broader applications closer to Earth will also be considered.  Moreover, it is hoped that this work will also shed light on the biology of motor control processes in general that might in turn help us understand neuromotor diseases.  Indeed, in a related work, the modelling of cancer metastasis using cellular automata is proposed.

"Heterotrophic bacteria play a major role in the functioning of all aquatic systems. Planktonic bacteria are responsible for much of the nutrient cycling, for the transformation and degradation of organic matter and for a significant portion of the total energy flux in these ecosystems. While we now have a relatively good idea of the broad patterns in microbial carbon and nutrient metabolism in aquatic ecosystems, and of the environmental factors that shape them, we still do not understand how these patterns are actually generated. For example, we still do not know to what extent changes in community metabolism observed in lakes and other systems are the result of the activation and inactivation of coexisting bacterial groups, or to the replacement of existing groups by others with different intrinsic metabolic capabilities. This represents a major gap in our current understanding of the functioning and regulation of aquatic microbial communities. The central goal of the proposed research is to establish the physiological and phylogenetic basis of the patterns in community carbon metabolism in planktonic bacterial communities along environmental gradients and especially in transition zones and ecotones. The proposed research combines advanced techniques in molecular ecology, single-cell approaches based on flow cytometry and cell-sorting, metabolic measurements at the community level, and organic carbon biogeochemistry. The sampling approach will be dynamic, focusing on how these microbial communities change and react as they move along entire watersheds, and across critical interfaces and major environmental features. The long-term goal of this program is to bridge the major gap in our understanding of the links that exist between bacterial community metabolism, composition and the physiological structure of the community, and how these in turn influence biogeochemical function in aquatic ecosystems. This research will advance our basic understanding of the functioning of aquatic ecosystems, but it also has major implications to broader questions in Ecology and Evolution concerning the links between diversity and ecosystem function, current topics of intense research and debate.

"In Knowledge Representation (KR) in Artificial Intelligence, an agent deals with a problem domain which could be a specific problem area (such as diagnosis), a physical domain (such as encountered by a robot) or a ""virtual"" domain (such as provided by the web). In all such cases, the agent's knowledge will generally be incomplete, inaccurate to some extent, and constantly changing. An important problem in KR is to manage this change of information, whether the agent has been told a new fact, or has carried out some actions, or has been given a set of observations from different sources.



The main focus of this research is on belief change, which deals with how an agent should modify its beliefs on the basis of new information. While much work has been carried out, there are crucial issues that have yet to be fully addressed. For example, it is not clear that the formal models that we have fully characterize all aspects of belief change; as well, there is no agreement as to how an agent should incorporate a sequence of observations about a fixed environment. This research will address the problem of belief change, and the wider problem of reasoning in a dynamic world of agents that can carry out actions. First, mathemetical models characterizing aspects of belief change will be developed, and second, complementary to this, computational models will be developed and studied in the context of their applicability in different areas.



A secondary, but strongly related, topic of research concerns reasoning with preferences. Typically an agent will have not just (strict) goals to attain, but also things that are desirable, but not necessary, to establish. The use of preferences in planning, as well as the role of preferences in belief change, will also be addressed.

"Fluorescent-labeling of biological molecules has become a powerful tool for the analysis of cellular events using the light microscope. Several quantitative microscopy techniques that use fluorescent labels have been developed that allow the study of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids within living cells. Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) and Photoactivation (PA), are two techniques used to measure the diffusion of biological molecules and to track their movement. Our 5  research groups are requesting FRAP/PA Unit to upgrade a state-of-the-art spinning-disk confocal laser microscopy system. The FRAP/PA Unit provides the ability to accurately localise and track the rapid movement of biological molecules in 3 dimensions (3D), with limited loss of fluorescence over time, and with reduced cellular damage. As such, this upgrade significantly increases the capabilities of the existing infrastructure. The FRAP/PA Unit will support the research programs of our 5 groups, which encompass a range of fundamental studies in basic science, including: the study of how cells respond to DNA damage; how nerve cells in the brain develop; how lipids regulate cellular processes; how proteins such as collagen form complex structures; and how the biological machinery that drives smooth muscle contraction functions. Once installed, this upgrade module will make the CFI funded microscope a one of kind instrument in Atlantic Canada, providing a unique training opportunity for students to learn advanced quantitative light microscopy techniques. The requested equipment will also be accessible to research groups other than those named in this application thereby facilitating the research of many other investigators at Dalhousie University.

"Osteoarthritis (OA) occurs worldwide, and is probably the most common rheumatic condition that causes disability. Mechanical factors that are important to OA include abnormal loading of joints due to oddities of limb alignment and/or previous injury, unusual patterns of gait, obesity, or excessive demands made on joints. Gait analysis is the only means currently available to measure joint motion and forces during activities of daily living. The challenge has been the distilling of clinically relevant information from the gait data. A new approach, based on pattern recognition techniques, has been described by the applicant that overcomes the highly complex, nature of gait waveform data, while maintaining the salient information in the waveform data. This research proposal builds upon this work through the development of additional analytical tools for gait analysis of patients with knee joint OA. Some of these tools are for the extension of these pattern recognition techniques, while others are to provide the means to obtain better estimates of the joint contact forces during activities of daily living. These estimates will allow us to better understand the causes of knee arthritis so that we can improve treatments for this disease.","Biomedical engineering","Mechanical Engineering - A"

"Organisms compete for resources, interact with predators, parasites and mutualists, affect their environment by using resources, and producing waste. Thus, ecosystems are the theatre in which interactions take place, but they are also, to a certain extent, a result of the organisms present. The present work will uncover some of the dynamics this creates, from a theoretical perspective, using mathematical models to understand basic rules about these complex feedbacks between organisms and their environment. Five specific research topics are outlined. 1-Coexistence and evolution: what explains the diversity of life that we observe around us, how come so many species can coexist, which seem to have very similar requirements? This topic has attracted a lot of attention from ecologists, and I propose to explore the evolutionary dynamics involved in coexistence mechanisms, to understand the cases where evolutionary dynamics can prevent coexistence. 2 and 3- Mutualism and evolution: many species are involved in interactions involving cooperation, whereas ecological theory focuses mainly on competition. The first project will develop models to understand the evolutionary dynamics that lead to two species trading for two resources and the consequences on resource use and population sizes. The second project will aim at understanding the trading relationships between plants and the micro-organisms that live in their roots. 4- Diversity and evolution. This research topic will uncover the effect of diversity on species' evolutionary dynamics. 5- Ecosystem and evolution. This final topic will aim to understand when plant litter quality is going to be selected for because it modifies the environment to favour the plant over its competitor. Overall, this research program will increase our understanding of ecological and evolutionary dynamics in ecosystems, to build an understanding of long-term ecosystem functioning and be able to predict the effects of global changes on key aspects of ecosystem functioning such as primary production and nutrient cycling.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Evolution & Ecology"

"The identification of thousands of  carbon stars in Local Group galaxies, by my collaborators and I, offers a unique opportunity to employ these stars as probes to investigate several aspects of the structure and star formation history of these systems. This is the case because carbon stars are easy to distinguish among red giant stars and because they have a well defined luminosity. 



We have shown that the ratio of number of carbon stars, to the number of M giant stars (rich in oxygen rather than carbon) is a good indication of the chemical abundance of the stellar population. This ratio allows  us to map the chemical abundance along the disk of nearby galaxies.



Carbon stars are bright members of the intermediate-age stellar population, stars just a few billion years old. Therefore, maps of carbon stars and much older giant stars in the outskirts of galaxies provide information on the star formation history in low density environment. We are interested to know if stars are formed over nearly the whole life of the galaxy or just at the very beginning.

 

Since the photometrically defined  carbon stars show a narrow range of luminosity, one can obtained their distance once their apparent brightness is known. Our Milky Way contains thousands of them, They are located in the disk thus  offer an excellent tool to map the rotation velocity of the disk to great distances. We intend to obtain the radial velocity of several hundred  Galactic carbon stars to determine the rotation curve of the Milky Way up to 25 kpc from its center. This is particularly interesting since few other probes outside the solar circle can be use to obtain the rotation curve.

"Canadian aerospace industry is currently facing emerging challenges throughout their global supply chain. These challenges have forced the management to consider new objectives such as increasing the supply chain agility, reducing lead times and improving suppliers' coordination, besides the traditional objective of keeping the cost at minimum. The simultaneous attainment of these objectives will enable the Canadian aerospace industry to stand against new competitors entering their home market. 



In this research program, we propose an integrated framework that tackles the strategic, tactical and operational related problems encountered in complex supply chains operating under uncertainty.  Novel mathematical models are proposed to optimize issues related to capacity planning, supplier selection, distribution network planning, integrated inventory management, and short-term activities scheduling from a supply chain perspective. New solution techniques based on genetic algorithms, branch and bound, decomposition techniques, portfolio theory, fuzzy clustering and lean techniques are developed to solve the proposed models.



Throughout supply chains operating in an uncertain environment, there is ambiguity associated with estimation of different operating costs and available resources, and stochastic uncertainty in demand and supplier lead times. Fuzzy set theory and possibility theory will be used to represent experts' subjective judgment concerning the estimation of ambiguous parameters and stochastic models to deal with fluctuating demand and supplier lead times.

The short-term objectives are: 1) to develop an eddy-permitting sea-ice model of the Labrador Sea, 2) to apply the model with a data assimilation scheme for ocean and sea-ice simulations of the Labrador Sea, and 3) to conduct a model study of the mesoscale eddies dynamics in the Labrador Sea, and its impact on the interannual variability of heat and water mass transport in the basin.

The approach taken in this research combines observations and modeling through: 1) estimation of the ocean state and its variability by using ocean model and data assimilation; 2) statistical and energetic analysis of model simulations, and 3) analysis of the model errors by model and data inter-comparison and identifying the model improvement needed for future studies. 

Simulations with the model and data assimilation system will be performed for the recent 50 years. The processes of deep convection, seasonal and inter-annual variability of the sea will be studied.The novelty of the work lies in the use of the data assimilation procedure implemented within an eddy-permitting ocean model in order to make a best estimate of the ocean characteristics by using all available observations and an up-date ocean model. The techniques and methods developed in the project will be of broad general significance for the ongoing initiatives for ocean operational modeling. The results will contribute to establishment of an integrated approach for marine studies in the Northwestern Atlantic, as the realistic simulations will be complementary to the observing system. The high degree of realism of the model simulations are favorable for future development of a coupled ecosystem and hydrodynamics model for the Labrador Sea.

"The primary objective of this research project is to allow applications to realize the performance potential of emerging computer hardware systems, by dynamically optimizing execution paths across multiple software layers. The main challenge in achieving this objective arises from the growing complexity of computer systems and the many layers of abstraction that have been developed to help manage this complexity. Two

technology trends highlight the problem.  First, emerging micro-processors (such as Sun's multi-core, multithreaded Niagara) have subtle performance characteristics that are extremely difficult to understand and exploit, even for expert programmers. At the same time, programmers are using languages such as Java, where the code is interpreted by an abstract machine.  The productivity gains that these languages provide are based, in part, on a higher-level abstraction that frees the programmer from the unpleasant details of real hardware. Between the code written by programmers and the instructions executed by the real hardware lie many other layers, including a language-level virtual machine, the operating system, a low-level virtual machine, and a virtual machine monitor. This scenario is quite likely to arise in current web hosting centres.

     Our research explores a variety of ways to break down at run-time the barriers imposed by static layers of abstraction. As one specific project, we will explore integrating compiler-based memory management algorithms into a Java JIT compiler, so that the generated code can interact with the JVM's heap management system, which will in turn inform the operating system of candidates for page prefetch and replacement. As a second specific project, we will investigate the use of dynamically-generated execution traces within the operating system code itself (past projects have applied these techniques to user-level code only). Our initial goal will be to support enhanced profiling and performance instrumentation of the OS, followed by dynamically optimizing execution paths within the OS, with the ultimate goal of integrating user-level and system-level execution traces.","Computer software","Computing and Information Sciences - A"

"The central topic of my research interests revolves about the symmetries of Nature and the relations between these symmetries. More specifically, I study kinematical algebras such as Poincar� algebra (which underlies all relativistic theories), Galilei algebra (fundamental in Newtonian physics), de Sitter (with relativistic curved space-time), Newton-Hooke (non-relativistic curved space-time), etc. The mathematical procedures which connect these symmetries are called ""contractions"" and ""deformations"" of Lie algebras. In principle, they allow one to deduce further knowledge about some symmetries from the associated symmetries. I will apply these techniques to other types of symmetries such as the infinite-dimensional Lie algebras which occur in conformal field theories such as string theory or the critical phenomena of statistical physics.



Much of my research program is devoted to a five-dimensional covariant formalism of Galilean invariance similar to the elegant methods of special relativity. Our purpose is to better understand some low-energy collective phenomena. My collaborators and I have already utilized it to study field quantization, abelian gauge theories, arbitrary spin fields, etc. Among other projects, we now plan to generalize some fluids and superfluids models.



In parallel with the main programs, I plan to perform some phenomenological computations using a finite-temperature  finite-density field theory algebraic formalism called ""thermofield dynamics"". I also plan to consider some applications of the representation theory of Lie algebras to particle physics, in particular, to horizontal symmetries underlying the structure of fermionic families and to effective field theories.

"The McGill Hydrometallurgy group and Teck have agreed to collaborate in the area of encapsulation of arsenic waste materials. This constitutes a paradigm-shifting approach to toxic material disposal not undertaken/explored previously. The proposed work aims to address the issue of safe disposal of iron-deficient and arsenic-rich waste materials that have been historically produced or are being produced in various non-ferrous metallurgical operations. Some examples of arsenic-rich waste materials are arsenic trioxide flue dust, arsenic-rich acid plant effluents or arsenic-containing residues. The object of this research is to investigate and ultimately contribute to the development of a new generation arsenic waste stabilization technology based on the concept of encapsulation. The aim is to render the arsenic-containing material totally inert (non-reactive) to a wide range of pH and redox conditions hence allowing its safe long-term disposal-burial without the risk of breakdown and arsenic release. This is intended to be achieved via a two-step approach: (1) Conversion of unstable arsenic waste material (such as As2O3) to scorodite (FeAsO4.2H2O) and (2) encapsulation of the scorodite solids with resistant to dissolution coating layers-matrixes. The proposed research focuses on the encapsulation of scorodite. Among the encapsulating materials to be investigated are: hydroxy/fluoroapatites, silicates, calcium carbonate, and aluminum hydroxygels-materials that are not prone to reductive breakdown on one hand and on the other are stable in the neutral to alkaline range of pH conditions. The proposed research upon completion and transfer to industry of the major discoveries (in terms of knowledge and processes), is expected not only to significantly improve Canada's ability to deal with the environmental challenges imposed by the generation of arsenic-bearing wastes but also to contribute to Canada's role as world leader in developing and implementing advanced environmental technologies.

"The overall objective of this project proposal is the development of new generation solar cell technology with

the potential of rendering solar energy an economically attractive sustainable energy source. Dye-sensitized

nanocrystalline titania-based solar cells (DSSC) hold the promise of achieving this breakthough. For this type

of cells, though, to become a successful commercial reality major advances in the area of photoelectrode

material preparation and electrolyte development are required. It is indeed the scope of the present research to

address these two critical R&D issues by aiming at: (1) the elaboration of a low temperature (hence low cost)

aqueous-based synthesis method for tailor-made nanocrystalline titania material; (2) the

application/development of new coating, annealing and senstization processes for the deposition/sintering of

titania films on plastic materials hence facilitating cell manufacturing;(3) and the development of a

leakage-free gel electrolyte that overcomes the short lifespan of the present liquid electrolyte-based solar cell

design. Development of knowhow and materials/processes that can enable the fabrication of low-cost new

generation solar cell modules as proposed here has the potential to lead to new exportable advance technologies

and greater use of solar energy at home hence helping meeting our sustainable energy needs.

The overall goal of our research program is the development of an original body of knowledge and novel innovative processing concepts that can ultimately influence industrial process design and practice towards sustainability and value addition for our raw mineral/metal resources. Our efforts over the next five years will be geared in particular towards the study and optimization of new generation hydrometallurgical technologies considered for (a) the processing of complex mineral feedstocks (chloride hydrometallurgy), (b) the control of hazardous environmental pollutants (arsenic immobilization), and (c) the production of advanced materials (nano-TiO2 and battery-grade MnO2).

"Various types of data arise in almost every field. Data in the form of counts and proportions, multivariate, multilevel or clustered lifetime data, high dimensional data, spatial and temporal high throughput data often occur in public health, toxicology, epidemiology, medicine,  genetics, environmental science  and so on.   My proposed research will deal with the analysis of complex data.  One frequently encountered problem in data analysis is that the existing models fail to explain the variation that exists in data and the effects of covariates. Also, data occasionally display a mixture of properties; the data are drawn from a mixed distribution or a mixture of two or more populations. We therefore need valid procedures to detect departures from the existing model and develop an effective model to fit the data.  Further we need to consider the estimation of parameters and functions in the parametric, semi-parametric and non-parametric (functional)  regression models.  A second problem is that often the failure times of interest cannot be observed directly. Only information about whether each failure time lies in the time interval of two consecutive monitoring times is available.  In this situation, the concern is the survival probability of the lifetime variables and the effects of covariates to these lifetimes. Our goal is to establish the regression models for this kind of data, in particular, for multivariate interval-censored data.  A third problem is the need for medical cost estimation in different cases. In clinical trials comparing different treatments, in health economics, and in outcomes research, medical costs are frequently analyzed to evaluate the economical impacts of new treatment options and economic values of health-care utilization. I expect to propose an approach to deal with the estimation of the lifetime  medical cost under the different types of statisitical censoring mechanism. Other problem is to develop effective methods to analyze temporal gene expression data. I will collaborate with biostatisticians to work out this problem.

"The increasing demand for broadband millimeter-wave systems for  military and commercial applications has raised many challenges in several fields, particularly in radio engineering. One of these challenges is the design and characterization of antennas at mm-wave frequencies. For this purpose, various designs have been proposed, such as microstrip patches, CPW antennas, or slot antennas. However, these types of antennas, which fulfill the requirements in the microwave bands, do not offer sufficient performance in the mm-wave bands in terms of radiation efficiency. This is due to very high conductor losses arising from immense current densities at the strip edges, especially in the feeding networks. As an alternative to these designs, we have proposed several  research projects that aim to design new advanced mm-wave antennas. In these projects, design and experimental characterization are the two most crucial steps  for achieving high-performance. To achieve this, numerical analyses based on electromagnetic field simulations have firstly been used. Although numerical analysis provides a good guideline of the design, actual radiation pattern measurements are mandatory  for accurately characterizing antenna performance. In this perspective,  we propose a mm-wave antenna measurement setup. This measurement system  is mainly composed of three parts: an anechoic chamber, a near-field scanner and a mm-wave vector network analyzer. The first two items are already installed and available in our RF laboratory, but the third item is the missing part of our measurement system. Therefore, in this proposal, we request a mm-wave vector network analyzer to cover a frequency range up to 67 GHz.

The requested instrument will strengthen the equipment already available in our RF laboratory at INRS.  The objectives of the present application are, (i) developing and testing new efficient mm-wave high-gain and broadband antennas for future mm-wave wireless communications systems, consistently with the specific needs of the high-technology Canadian industry, and (ii) train highly qualified personnel to respond to the scientific and technological challenges of our society.","Communications equipment","Electrical and Computer Engineering"
"The objective of the proposed research program is to investigate and design innovative advanced antennas to achieve a high gain, reconfigurable radiation pattern capability and multi-band operation for future generations of wireless communications at millimeter-wave bands. This research program focuses on tree inter-related projects: millimeter-wave dielectric resonator antennas, electromagnetic band gap (EBG) materials and their applications in the design of agile EBG antennas with multi-band operation, and beamforming antenna array systems. (i)  I will pursue the theoretical and experimental studies  of high-gain and broadband dielectric resonator antennas operating in millimeter-wave bands, this topic includes antenna design, modeling and development using new dielectric materials and new architectures, ii) I will continue to investigate agile antennas with reconfigurable radiation pattern using new materials such as EBG structures or metamaterials, and we  also expect  to extend this  concept to dual- and multi- band agile EBG antennas in order to simultaneously serve different systems at different frequency bands, and (iii)  I also propose to perform theoretical and experimental investigations for developing new beamforming antenna array systems for wireless applications at millimeter-wave bands.  In this research program, I intend to capitalize on my previously successful work and continue to excel in designing new advanced antennas for millimeter-wave wireless applications.  

In conclusion, this program will contribute (i) to better understand the physical and electrical mechanisms involved in the design  of millimeter-wave dielectric resonator antennas; (ii) to foster focused research activities in electromagnetic band gap materials and their applications in advanced agile EBG antennas; (iii) to develop innovative beamforming antenna arrays, consistently with specific needs of Canadian high technology  industry; and (iv) to train highly qualified personnel to respond to the scientific and technological challenges of our modern society.","Communications technologies (satellites, radar, etc.)","Electrical and Computer Engineering"
"Speech is one of the most intricate motor behaviours in humans characterized by very fast and precise articulatory movements. The sensorimotor mechanisms that control speech and its development are not well understood. They are investigated using typical as well as disordered speech production in adults and children. The current proposal focuses on speech production in children who stutter, which is a developmental disorder, typically first diagnosed in prepubescent children, characterized by disruptions of speech fluency. Because it is characterized by both fluent and disfluent speech, the severity of which can be manipulated, it constitutes a natural model for studying speech production and its perturbations. Previous research completed by our group has shown that stuttering adults show a deficit in their ability to acquire novel motor sequences. Because this is apparent in both speech and nonspeech behaviour we have hypothesized the presence of a generalized motor deficit. This observation allows us to use nonspeech motor tasks to gain insight into processes that are important for speech production also. However, data obtained in adults may not necessarily be relevant to younger children who are still developing their motor skills. We plan to extend our earlier research by investigating speech and nonspeech motor learning in children who do and do not stutter.  A number of studies will be completed investigating children's abilities to learn novel speech and nonspeech (finger tapping) sequences. Motor practice will be presented either explicitly (children are told what to practice) or implicitly (children are not aware of the practice task). In addition, experiments are proposed which manipulate the frequency of feedback provided during task completion. Finally, a functional magnetic resonance imaging study is proposed to analyze the neural processes underlying motor learning in children.  The results from this study will allow us to contribute to the understanding of the development of speech motor control processes and to gain a deeper understanding in the processes that may underlie disordered speech.

"Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are emerging multi-hop wireless networks that can provide low cost, high speed Internet access for public and commercial applications.  WMNs may be deployed as last-mile network access in many application areas such as community networks, intelligent transportation systems, municipality networks, public safety communications and surveillance systems. Despite research advances in the area in last few years and the network deployments, several research challenges still exist. Improving the network performance, efficient and fair use of the available resources requires further theoretical research and experimental studies. So far, research work focused mainly on the design of routing and Media Access Control protocols for pure ad hoc or infrastructure-based WMNs using strict layering approaches. Cross-layer design and optimization, intelligent techniques for data management, routing and mobility management schemes have not received much attention. In the past four years, my research team has been working on various topics in mobile and wireless multi-hop networks with focus on data management, mobility management, routing schemes and design of protocols for the integration of the Internet with mobile ad hoc networks. Our previous work has built a foundation for the work proposed in this research. The general objective of the current research work is to develop and evaluate data management techniques, routing and mobility management architectures, protocols and algorithms for infrastructure and hybrid WMNs.

    The three topics data management, routing and mobility management are basically related.  Data management protocols and algorithms can exploit routing and mobility management architectures and protocols for their efficiency and effectiveness.  Furthermore, with cross-layer design and optimizations approach, lower and upper layer protocol stack information can be exchanged to optimize the overall network performance. These topics will be studied using analytical models, simulation techniques, implementation test-beds and statistical analysis.

"The objectives of my proposed research are to understand the dynamics of interactions between marine biogeochemical cycles and climate change by (i) developing new models of ocean biogeochemical systems, including planktonic foodwebs, and (ii) applying these models in the context of observational projects to analyze how these systems respond to and regulate the earth system and climate on time scales from hours to decades. The specific research planned under this proposal, to be carried out initially by my PhD student, Laura Bianucci, is to study the oxygen and carbon dioxide cycles on the continental shelve off Vancouver Island. This region is characterized by summer upwelling driven by prevailing winds from the northwest. The upwelling provides: (1) nutrients from deeper waters that support enhanced uptake of carbon dioxide by phytoplankton through photosynthesis, and (2) high concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon, leading to outgassing of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The small difference between these opposite processes determines if the shelf is a net source or sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The upwelling of deeper waters off this coast also brings up low oxygen waters. Increased biological oxygen demand at or near the bottom due to the respiration of organic carbon may lead to regions of anoxic bottom waters and mortality of bottom animals. We will develop a coupled circulation, biogeochemical, bottom sediment, foodweb model to study what processes are most important in regulating the carbon dioxide and dissolved oxygen cycles in this upwelling system.","Oceans and inland waters","Environmental Earth Sciences"

"My research focus is on modelling particles and interface phenomena in complex fluids, particularly colloids in liquid crystals and interface-driven fluid dynamics at the micro- and nano-scale. The objectives are three-fold: (1) To provide a tool for studying in-vivo microrheology of anisotropic fluid environments, such as those naturally occurring in biological systems. (2) To improve our understanding of colloidal nematic suspensions so that self-assembled structures, such as those suggested as the basis of 3D photonic band-gap materials, can be manipulated and constructed in a controlled fashion.  (3) To construct models for surface-dominated flow regimes relevant for micro- and nano-fluidic devices.

To achieve these goals I will use continuum models whose functional form and constitutive coefficients will be based on the results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.  Specifically, MD simulations will be used to characterize the interactions between objects immersed in a liquid crystal, such as nanowires, that arise from a competition between the bulk orientational order of the liquid crystal and the preferred ordering at the surface of the colloidal inclusion.  The molecular origin of the surface elasticity and orientational ordering for both solid and liquid inclusions will be explored. The results of the MD simulations will guide the design of lattice Boltzmann models.  These models will be employed to study  (1) the viscoelastic response of nanowires immersed in an anisotropic fluid and (2) colloidal suspensions of spheres in liquid crystals that form self-organized lattice structures.  Goal (3) will involve a similar mapping of molecular dynamics to continuum models for polar fluids.  It will be necessary to go beyond a standard continuum description of the fluid and to include electrostatic effects related to surface charge densities.   The resulting model will be used to explore the problem of droplet motion in microfluidic devices driven by electrowetting and other surface stress gradients at the solid-fluid wall.

"Snow cover persists for long periods of time over many parts of Canada, which significantly impacts regional climate, hydrology through snow melt, and ecology. In spite of this importance, measurements of snow cover, particularly across northern Canada, are limited by sparse observations. Satellite measurements can address this observational gap, but algorithms need to be developed to estimate physical parameters such as snow water equivalent (the amount of liquid water stored in solid form by a snowpack) from the satellite observations. Global climate models predict increases in winter season precipitation, and spring melt water is an important national resource, so we are faced with a scenario where information about snow cover is increasingly important, yet the conventional observation network is inadequate and existing satellite datasets are limited by high levels of uncertainty. This project seeks to develop new satellite derived snow cover datasets. The satellite data record extends back to 1978, so techniques developed with new data can be applied retrospectively to create time series over 30 years in length. Ground measurements with instruments similar to those in space will be acquired over a complete snow cover season to provide the required 'ground-truth' observations. These activities will position Canada to contribute important new measurements to support future international satellite missions designed specifically to measure snow.

"Clouds, transport of sand by rivers, chemical reactors producing polystyrene particles, and aerated bioreactors are examples of dispersed multiphase flow. In dispersed multiphase flows, two or more components are flowing simultaneously, with at least one of them being in the form of bubbles, particles, or droplets. Clouds are a great many tiny water droplets or ice crystals dispersed in a turbulent air flow; in rivers sand particles are carried by a water flow. In the chemical and related industries, multiphase flows come in a great variety: bubbly flows (gas bubbles in liquid), suspensions (solid particles in gas or liquid), liquid-liquid dispersions (two immiscible liquids like oil and water, one dispersed in the other). On top of being multiphase, many industrial flows are also turbulent. The complex interplay between the phases, and the turbulence is the subject of this research proposal. It is motivated by the desire to better understand, control, and design industrial processes. 

    We plan to develop highly efficient (parallel) computer algorithms to simulate multiphase flows in great detail. A natural distinction in this respect is between micro (the size of the particles, millimetres and less), and macro (the size of the process equipment, could be up to meters). Despite the great variety in dispersed multiphase flows, macroscopically speaking they have many common grounds and can be described in a universal mathematical and computational framework. What distinguishes them is their micro physics: solid particles interact differently than liquid drops, or gas bubbles. The focus will be on liquid-liquid dispersions and bubbly flows. In liquid-liquid dispersions, the turbulence largely determines the drop size distribution by initiating break-up and coalescence. For bubbly flows an even distribution of gas bubbles throughout a reactor and large (gas-liquid) interfacial area are essential process conditions. Carefully simulating the interactions between macro and micro-scale will lead to truly predictive modelling of industrial processes with positive implications for process efficiency (reduced energy and raw materials usage) and product quality (e.g. a better control over particle size distributions, or product composition).

"Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the brightest objects in the universe.  They are powered by the accretion of matter spiraling into a supermassive black hole (BH), millions and even billions of times more massive than the Sun.  In the past few years, it has been convincingly demonstrated that such BHs lurk in the centres of all galaxies at least as massive as our own Galaxy, the Milky Way.  Even more surprising, the ratio of the mass of the BH to the mass in old stars in the galaxy - the bulge - appears to be a constant.  Why should this be so?  And what mechanisms initiate activity in some galactic nuclei, and how is this activity maintained?  These are the questions that remain unanswered and that motivate the majority of my proposed research projects.  



With my graduate students and colleagues, I plan to take an accurate census of AGNs of all brightness levels using data from a deep, high-quality survey being undertaken at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (the Legacy Survey) which has important implications for how galaxies form and evolve.  We also plan to search for reasons behind the constancy of the ratio of the BH mass to the mass in the bulge by adopting new techniques with which to study data from the Legacy Survey.

 

With another colleague, I will continue to develop and calibrate a technique that will permit us to determine the surface temperature and metal content in M stars, a class of stars less massive than the Sun that comprises over 80% of the stars in the Milky Way and for which few such empirical measurements have been made.

"The sea ice habitat upon which polar bears depend is vulnerable to projected climate change. Reduction in sea ice extent, duration, thickness, and snow cover, as well as displacement of the marginal ice zone can significantly impact reproductive success, foraging, migration patterns, and survivorship not only of polar bears, but also of their marine mammal prey. The objective of this research is to identify the underlying ecological processes that affect vital population rates (births, deaths, immigration and emigration) that determine changes in polar bear abundance. It involves the investigation of life history components of polar bears and the development of quantitative descriptions of the linkages between their life history and climate, sea ice, and prey. Research activities are focussed in 3 populations (Beaufort Sea, Foxe Basin, and Western Hudson Bay). Landscape ecology principles of habitat connectivity, fragmentation, movement corridors, and habitat patch size are the proposed framework for understanding climate change related impacts. Focus is placed on adult females to assess their reproductive success relative to space-use patterns. The long-term goal is the development of descriptive metrics and predictive capacity for understanding the impacts of climate variability and change on polar bears and their prey in a spatial-temporal context. The project involves significant innovation in 4 core areas: 1) Assessing the effects of climate and sea ice conditions on spatial and temporal patterns of polar bears movements via satellite tracking in conjunction with satellite ice imagery, 2) The effects of interannual variability and directional change in sea ice conditions on the phenotypic metrics, life history traits, and population dynamics, 3) Examination of cementum deposition in teeth collected from polar bears with inferences on life history events derived from annuli widths, 4) Use of physiological parameters such as serum urea/serum creatinine, leptin, and haptoglobin levels to assess fasting/feeding dynamics and health.

L'objectif 2 consiste � identifier les transcrits qui distinguent fonctionnellement chacune des communaut�s perturb�es des communaut�s t�moins et � rechercher des indices sur la dynamique historique de leur s�lection. Ces deux travaux sont un pr�alable au troisi�me objectif dont le but principal sera de reconstituer l'histoire �volutive de g�nes fonctionnels adaptatifs au sein de la communaut�. Ce troisi�me objectif consiste � �tablir une relation entre les diversit�s taxonomique et fonctionnelle de communaut�s microbiennes, caract�riser la variabilit� des g�nes candidats dans les communaut�s perturb�es et t�moins et � tester en milieu contr�l� l'effet de la s�lection sur une communaut� microbienne issue d'un lac non perturb� sur environ 2000 g�n�rations.

"When the cells in our body use oxygen, they naturally produce very reactive molecules known as ""free radicals"" which can damage the body. However, cells protect themselves from free radical damage using other molecules known as ""free radical scavengers"". These scavengers convert the dangerous free radicals molecules into less reactive molecules that no longer harm the cell. One free radical scavenger that is common in both plants and animals is a very small protein known as Thioredoxin. However, Thioredoxin does not act alone, but must make contact with other proteins to scavenge free radicals. One of these other proteins is called Thioredoxin Interacting Protein (Txnip). Thioredoxin and Txnip interact in the cell and form what is called a dimer (meaning two proteins interact). However, it is very likely that other proteins also interact with Thioredoxin and Txnip, and that Thioredoxin and Txnip form part of a larger protein complex made up of many proteins. So far, very few proteins are known that are part of this complex. Therefore, the purpose of my research program is to find the proteins which are part of the Thioredoxin/Txnip complex. We expect to find several proteins that are part of this complex and that make contact with Thioredoxin and/or Txnip. Knowing what makes up this complex will help us to understand how plants and animals protect themselves against damage from free radicals.

"I am interested in various time-constrained vehicle routing problems which arise mostly in freight transportation. A generic definition for these problems is: given a set of tasks, a time window (interval) for each task, and a set of capacitated vehicles assigned to one or several depots whose locations may have to be determined, find a set of least-cost feasible routes for those vehicles such that each task is executed once within its time window, each route is feasible with respect to vehicle capacity, and side constraints are satisfied. My long-term objectives are: 1- to develop mathematical decomposition methods for solving to optimality such problems; and 2- to show that, for these problems, such methods can be integrated into metaheuristic frameworks to yield, in reasonable times, better solutions than those produced by the exsiting heuristics.



In this proposal, I focus on the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), the multi-depot VRPTW (MDVRPTW), and the location-routing problem with time windows (LRPTW). For the VRPTW, I will develop an exact branch-and-price-and-cut (BPC) algorithm and a large neighborhood search heuristic that relies on a BPC heuristic for neighborhood exploration. For the MDVRPTW, I will generalize the exact and heuristic algorithms proposed for the VRPTW. Finally, for the LRPTW, I will introduce two exact algorithms, one based on BPC and the other on Benders decomposition, and a two-level large neighborhood search algorithms that works at the top level on depot location and, at the bottom level, on vehicle routing. To explore the neighborhoods, mixed integer programming and BPC are used at the top and bottom levels, respectively.



The research proposal will contribute to the development of efficient software systems for the transportation industry and produce methodological advances on three related problems. Its funding will support the training of 5 master's students, 2 PhD students, and 1 post-doc fellow.

"This research program investigates new approaches for lowering the expression level of a particular gene using the natural RNA interference (RNAi) pathway.  Since controlled gene expression levels are essential for proper biological function, the ability to silence or control the expression of genes is highly desirable.  The RNAi pathway is a natural biological process that relies on short double-stranded RNAs to target gene specific messenger RNA.  The potential of harnessing this natural pathway would have enormous impact on research and medicine worldwide, including Canada.  However, the main pitfalls prohibiting the success of natural double-stranded RNAs as silencing agents are a) short-lifetime; b) toxicity and off-target effects; c) and poor cell-membrane permeability.  



The short-term goals in overcoming these obstacles are to chemically manipulate the siRNAs with stable non-natural groups.  Our hypothesis is that by selectively placing stable functional groups within the backbone of siRNAs (in place of the labile negatively charged backbone) this will make them more resistant to degradation, will increase cell-membrane permeability, and potentially increase selectivity and specificity.  Other short term goals include the biophysical characterization and a variety of cell-based functional assays.  In short, this proposal will involve utilizing a combination of synthetic organic chemistry, bioorganic chemistry, biophysical chemistry, and biochemistry.  The highly qualified personnel working on this research program will gain valuable training essential for success in their future careers.  In conclusion, the long-term goal of our research program is to accurately predict the stability and specificity profile that chemically modified siRNAs have on its ability to illicit an RNAi response.

"Mineral processing is the sector of the mining industry in which ore is sufficiently upgraded for its use in the

profitable production of metal. Typically, in a mineral processing plant ore is initially crushed and ground to

liberate valuable mineral particles from useless minerals (gangue). The next step involves the separation of

these components through physical mechanisms, the most common being the flotation process. One ofthe

commercial devices used for this step is the flotation column.  The objective ofthis project is to develop sensors and control algorithms to optimize the real-time operation of such devices based on an economic criterion. To attain this objective, a pilot flotation column will be installed in the plant of one of our partners. Numerous tests could then be carried out in this industrial environment without interfering with plant production.  The simultaneous automatic control of the variables that will be measured has never been accomplished thus far. This new acquired knowledge will help our partners improve the operation of their flotation columns.  Even slight improvements in the metallurgical performance ofthe flotation column (better concentrate grade and recovery) will provide substantial monetary benefits. Given today's context of economic globalization, the Canadian mining industry must adopt these kinds of approaches to increase competitiveness.

"Autonomous vehicles, with their remote sensing and transport capabilities, will play an ever-increasing role in civilian and military communities, as confirmed by the Minister of National Defence, who in August 2008 announced a plan to equip our Canadian Forces with new Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Typical civilian applications include search and rescue, fire detection and homeland security disaster preparedness and mitigation. Military missions can include tactical surveillance, precision strikes, battle damage assessment, etc. 



The main objective of this project is to develop and test new and robust path planning algorithms that can guide a fleet of UAVs flying in an unknown three-dimensional dynamic environment in order to fulfill a specific mission, while respecting time and spatial constraints. 



Each UAV will be stabilized by an autopilot and is equipped with sensors measuring the position of objects in space. Only objects situated within sensor range are detected by the vehicles. UAVs within communication range also exchange information they have gathered about their environment (target and obstacle locations, etc.). Each UAV is also equipped with an adaptive trajectory control unit that will be developed in this project. It will calculate on-line the best set points for its autopilot, based on its knowledge of the mission and the surrounding environment.

"Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an approach for assessing the environmental impacts associated with each life cycle stage (i.e. from raw material extraction to final disposal) of a product, process or service.  An LCA consists of four phases: 1) Goal & scope definition; 2) Life cycle inventory (LCI); 3) Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA); and 4) Interpretation (ISO 14040, 2006).  The LCIA phase is crucial and consists of assessing the environmental potential impacts. Among impact categories, toxicological and ecotoxicological impact categories, unlike the others, reflect local rather than global impacts. These impacts are thus more complicated to model due to their specific character and require spatial differentiation to be taking into account.  In the context of using LCA as a decision-making tool for contaminated site management, this problem becomes evident when comparing primary impacts (caused by the soil contamination) to secondary impacts (caused by the remediation activities themselves). Many studies in this field neglect the characterization of primary impacts due to the generic aspect of models used in LCIA.  In order to better assess primary impacts of contaminated sites, research is needed to 1) adapt LCIA global multimedia fate models to a local scale, 2) develop terrestrial effect data to avoid using aquatic data as is currently the case and 3) develop characterization factors (CFs) for mixtures of contaminants that are generally found in contaminated soils. To characterize in an appropriate way the terrestrial ecotoxicological impact category, LUCAS, an LCIA method developed for the Canadian environmental context will be improved.  This research program aims to make LCIA more relevant and scientifically defendable when assessing impacts related to contaminated site management.  Currently, the number of Canadian specialists in the LCA field is quite low, particularly with respect to the characterization of local impacts such as ecotoxicological terrestrial impact.

"The proposed research program in physics of materials under extreme conditions (pressure and temperature) represents a continuation of current experimental projects and new research initiatives at the Laboratoire de physique des solides denses (U. of Ottawa). In addition to on-site facilities, this program will make extensive of external experimental research facilities. It comprises four general research axes:

(1) Study (i) the structural stability, the crystalline structures, and the lattice dynamics of dense solids; (ii) temperature/pressure-induced phase transitions and underlying mechanisms; (iii) the physical properties of novel high-density materials. (2) Compare the measured physical properties of dense materials with computationally simulated properties to refine both the experimental and computational modeling. (3) Make intensive use of synchrotron radiation to probe dense materials by X-ray scattering. Synchrotron radiation research work will be carried out mostly at the Canadian Light Source (CLS). In fact, with the proposed project, we want to initiate and develop at the CLS a strong and structured program of research on materials at extreme conditions. (4)  In a complementary manner, develop novel experimental approaches to probe condensed matter submitted to extreme conditions using diamond anvil cells. 

The proposed research program is motivated by three main scientific problems, given as follows, which will be addressed through main axes listed above: the study of dense guest-host materials like (1) gas hydrates, for their potential as high-density/capacity gas storage, (2) their analogues Group IV clathrates, to study changes in electronic interactions at high density in these clathrate systems and also explore the potential of novel properties arising in high-density phases; We will continue, with national and international collaborators, (3) the exploration of dense forms of molecular and van der Waals solids, including dense pure oxygen and noble element/oxygen compounds.

"Cellular processes including cell differentiation, cell growth and cell division require a coordinated expression of specific sets of genes that trigger molecular pathways. While transcription constitutes a first level of gene regulation, post-transcriptional mechanisms (mRNA transport, translation and decay) are also required to properly link protein synthesis to cell needs. At the heart of these mechanisms, RNA-binding proteins such as Staufen bind specific subsets of mRNAs that code for functionally related proteins and coordinate their expression. Defects in these pathways are linked to complex human diseases such as mental retardation, myotonic dystrophy, immunoregulatory disorders and cancers. In the past years, we identified Staufen as a central component of several post-transcriptional mechanisms of mRNA regulation. However, little is known about what relevance these Staufen-mediated mechanisms have to cellular pathways and cell physiology. In this proposal, we will determine whether Stau1 regulates the post-transcriptional expression of cell cycle-associated transcripts. The major objectives of this proposal are to look for the role(s) of Stau1 during cell growth especially in relation to its capacity to bind subsets of mRNAs and to control their post-transcriptional expression. These studies will allow us to identify new pathways that control cell growth and may provide new tools for the study of cell division.","Medical and health sciences","Molec. & Develop. Genetics"

"Computers have become extremely important in many respects. They have a vital role when controlling complex systems, such as airplanes or medical apparatus. Fast computers linked to Internet let people and companies access a gigantic amount of information and make commercial transactions. The success of computers is indeed spectacular. The increased dependence on computers means that the flow of information must be precisely controlled; for instance, personal data should not be sent on the Internet without the owner's consent. Unfortunately, many programs have security flaws. These can be simple bugs that lead to undesired behaviour or bad features that are exploited by malevolent people. The goal of this research is to develop scientific techniques, based on strong mathematical foundations, to reduce the occurrence of such problems. The mathematical foundations consist mainly of the theory of control of discrete event systems (computer systems are a particular case of such systems) and of an algebraic theory known as Kleene algebra.



The basic idea is to compare a mathematical description of a program to a security policy (the comparison is made by another program, not by hand). If necessary, the program is modified to make it secure (it is thus ""controlled""). This modification is calculated by using principles of control theory. But control theory cannot be used as is, becaused it was not designed to solve this type of problem. Hence, part of the research will consist in extending control theory to handle the modification of unsafe programs in order to control them. Kleene algebra will be used for the description and extension of control theory, because it leads to compact and easily verifiable proofs. Kleene algebra is presently enjoying much attention from many researchers and it is finding more and more applications in computer science, while at the same time being studied for its own sake. This research will also contribute to the development of Kleene algebra itself and in particular to an extension called Kleene algebra with domain.

The US Army Research Office (ARO) has recently funded this project. The US proposal has identified Dr. Clarence de Silva of the University of British Columbia as the only Canadian collaborator of the planned research. The successful MURI application provides a unique window of opportunity for us to collaborate in this research project which is of significant mutual interest. The US researchers will primarily focus on dynamic sensor networking and information fusion in an unstructured urban environment for safety/security critical operations. Given these technologies of dynamically networked information acquisition and fusion, the proposed SRO project will concentrate on research to develop technologies for multi-robot cooperation in carrying out tasks critical for human safety/security in an unstructured urban environment. Specifically the SRO project will focus on: Behaviour-based Learning for Self-deterministic Cooperation of Robots; Use of Genetic Algorithms (GA) for Optimization of the Robotic Structure and Actions; Integration of GA with Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Generating Optimal Cooperation Policies; Use of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) for System Robustness and Self-organization; Soft Computing and Knowledge Based Decision Making for Intelligent Control; and Integration of US-originated Research on Dynamic Sensor Networking and Fusion. The activities will involve analytical research; computer simulation; technology development and implementation in a prototype laboratory system of multiple mobile robots; integration of the physical system together with a dynamic networking topology for communication and information fusion (developed by US researchers); practical demonstration of a realistic safety/security critical activity; and system evaluation through rigorous physical testing.","Construction, transportation and communications","SRO Program - College of Reviewers"
"Many large-scale engineering systems are networked groups of subsystems, forming for example, automated factories, ground transit systems, and healthcare delivery systems. The proposed research will make significant original contributions in modelling, analysis, design, development, and operation/control of such networked systems, by addressing the following categories of issues:  

1. A networked system may consist of interconnected multiple-domain (mechanical, electrical, thermal, fluid, etc.) components. What procedures of integrated modelling and analysis would be appropriate for them, which could facilitate design, development, operation and control of the system? 

2. A component may be able to perform multiple functions (e.g., a piezoelectric element can simultaneously serve as both a sensor and an actuator). What modifications would be needed in the above procedures in order to accommodate multifunctional components?

3. In a networked system there exist nondeterministic time delays and losses of data. How could the knowledge, as generated in activities 1 and 2, be beneficially incorporated into existing techniques of design, stability analysis, and control of a networked engineering system consisting of multi-domain and multifunctional devices? In particular, by using ""intelligence"" on component behaviour, could the sensory data be minimized and system complexity reduced, while facilitating effective control and good performance? 

    The developed technologies will be implemented in a practical and networked system in our laboratory (a networked plant consisting of a fish processing machine and robots), evaluated, and improved, for transfer to Canadian industry. The investigation will lead to improved methodologies/guidelines in modelling, analysis, design, and control of complex engineering systems, with benefits: optimality and better component matching; ease of system integration; compatibility and ease of cooperation with other systems; improved controllability and reliability; increased efficiency, cost effectiveness and system life; and improved product quality.

"Advanced multilayers and heterostructures are used in a variety of micro/optoelectronic devices while nanostructures exhibiting novel physical properties are of interest for future applications. Indeed, the demand for more flexibility in device design continues to stimulate the development of artificially nanostructured materials with tailorable properties. Our primary scientific objective is to develop a detailed understanding of atomic processes on surfaces and at interfaces in order to produce materials with predetermined properties.

   This proposal concerns texture in thin films. Its originality stems from the fact that we propose an innovative research program aimed at contributing to unifying two interrelated areas: the epitaxial growth of coherent heterogeneous structures from the vapor phase and the influence of texture inheritance on the mechanisms and kinetics of thermally-induced solid-state reactions in thin polycrystalline films. We propose: (i) To investigate the detailed effects of film texture on the reaction phase sequence and kinetics during solid state reactions. We are interested in finding predictive strategies for obtaining metastable phases. We also seek to exploit these phenomena for fabricating polycrystalline materials with predetermined microstructures. (ii) To develop an atomic-level understanding of the origin of preferred epitaxial and axiotaxial alignments in order to devise strategies for fabricating heterogeneous materials for a variety of applications. In particular, we seek to understand the role of strain, surface segregation, surface morphology, and crystal structure on the formation and alignment of nanoclusters during growth from the vapor phase using both MOVPE and MBE.

   We anticipate that the results of our research will be broadly applicable in the field of thin film synthesis in a large number of application areas. Training of highly qualified personnel is an integral part of this research program as graduate students and postdoctoral scientists involved in this research will acquire an in-depth knowledge of film growth, surface physics, as well as materials physics and characterization that prepares them perfectly for R&D careers in Canadian universities, national laboratories, and industries.

"Personalized and adaptive interfaces rely on models of the user's needs, interest, goals, and skills.  Personnalized study guides are successful examples of some innovative applications that have recently emerged.  They guide the user through a study process that can lead to an adequate preparation for an exam, a diploma, a new job, or simply a self-paced, self-motivated learning agenda.  They take full advantage of the one-on-one, personalized tutoring that a computer can offer by focusing the user's effort solely on the topics that are most relevant and require further study. One-on-one training was shown to improve student performance by a factor of two standard deviations over a classroom setting.



User models for cognitive skills assessment are critical components for such personalized, adaptive applications. Besides study guides and learning environments, they are also fundamental components for adapting explanations in intelligent help and assistants, or adapting the level of details and vocabulary in adaptive hypertext and adaptive applications in general.



The current research program's primary objective is to develop probabilistic models for skills assessment that are automatically built from test data.  We aim to construct skills assessment models from small data sets, yet with fine grained representations of skills.  The approach we advocate was already shown to outperform current approaches in terms of predictive accuracy.  In addition to being  computationally efficient and entirely automated, the approach can lead to generic, easy to use, and cost effective tools for a number of advanced and intelligent interfaces.

"The longstanding progress of conventional semiconductor technology is expected to come to a halt in the next ten to twenty years.  As the size of transistors approach the nanometer scale severe problems related to miniaturization and energy dissipation will hinder further improvement of conventional devices.  This anticipation is motivating the development of alternative devices that take advantage of the quantum nature at the atomic scale.  A notable example is the quantum computer concept, where each bit is formed by a single atom or a group of a few atoms, and the rules of quantum mechanics dictate the way information is processed.  Another interesting alternative is spintronics, where the spin of the electrons instead of their charge forms the basis for classical memory and logic, promising much lower rates of energy dissipation per device.  This research project addresses several theoretical questions related to the design and optimization of quantum computer and spintronic devices based on semiconductor, superconductor, and magnetic nanostructures.  We will investigate the physical origin of noise and decoherence affecting quantum computers based on superconducting nanostructures.  Our goal is to control the imperfections inherent to these devices in order to allow the development of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum hardware.  We will also study spin-dependent transport effects in silicon nanostructures implanted with a single or a few paramagnetic impurities.  This research is oriented towards optimizing the transduction of the spin state of the impurities into a source-drain voltage in a silicon device, with possible applications to silicon-based quantum computation and spintronics.  Another problem that will be addressed is the question of electrical control of magnetism in multiferroic materials.  These materials possess coexisting ferroelectric and magnetic order, allowing effective gate control of magnetism with possible applications to novel spintronic devices.

"How is it that although we exist in a state of continuous motion in our environment, the visual world we see in our minds eye remains still? We can move our body, our head and our eyes independently and still 'feel' as though the ground we walk on is solid and the walls around us are stable.  Somehow our brains are able to take in information through our senses and interpret this information through a complex network of neurons.  With the use of fMRI, we are able to study the signals, known as efference copy signals, generated from these neurons.  Furthermore, fMRI is the tool required to study how these efference copy signals are integrated with vision in various parts of the brain.

"Insect outbreaks, from seething swarms of locusts to writhing masses of caterpillars, can be spectacular, not only by their sheer numbers, but also by the way multitudes of individuals move and feed in concert. This pattern of collective behaviour is an emergent group property that arises from the responses of individuals to each other and to the environment.  Emergence means that interactions between individuals generate feedback loops leading to group behaviour that cannot be predicted from the behaviour of individuals.  Therefore,  studying the behaviour of groups, and how it emerges from that of individuals, is necessary to understand the ecology of group-living species. 

     The forest tent caterpillar is a group-living outbreaking forest pest across most of Canada. These caterpillars live in colonies that travel together between resting and feeding sites, laying pheromone trails behind them.  The purpose of my research is to show how individual behaviour generates the dynamics observed at the colony level, and to determine the role played by these dynamics in the species' ecology. Specifically, the questions I intend to answer are: 1. How do colonies stay together and keep synchronized?  2. How does food quality influence the timing and duration of caterpillar meals?  And, 3. How do patterns of colony collective foraging emerge from the answers to the previous two questions? 

     My research uses a bottom-up approach, starting by characterizing behaviour and determining the proximate mechanisms involved. Observations of individual caterpillars will be used to build computer models, whose predictions will be compared with the behaviour of colonies in the field. 

     This research programme will bring important insights to fundamental science in behavioural ecology by explaining how groups collectively make choices about when and where to feed.  It will also contribute to applied entomology by shedding insight into the role of group dynamics in both the individual and population ecology of outbreaking insects.

"Plants provide us with the food and oxygen we require for our survival. This dependence on plants for food production translates into agriculture being a major employer in Canada. Nevertheless, farm income is dependent on productivity and one of the major problems curtailing agricultural yield is disease caused by microorganisms. To protect crops, farmers spray their fields with organic chemicals. An alternative or complementary approach to crop protection is the development of varieties with enhanced disease resistance to pathogens. This approach has traditionally been an area of focus for plant breeders. However, molecular biologists and biochemists bring another dimension to this quest. Accordingly, they develop molecular markers useful in assisting breeders to select resistant varieties. At the same time, they focus on developing long term solutions which will require a thorough understanding of the molecular events leading to pathogen resistance. In that line of thought, the goal of the proposed research program is to generate new knowledge that will bring us one step closer to unraveling the black box that holds the molecular events leading to pathogen resistance. This goal will be accomplished by studying the arabidopsis NPR1 pathway. More specifically, proteins interacting with NPR1 will be identified and characterized with respect to post-translational modifications. The proposed research makes use of modern molecular biology and proteomics tools, including protein sequencing by tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The new knowledge generated will, in time, lead to the development of durable and environmentally friendly disease resistance in crops.","Advancement of knowledge","Plant Biology & Food Science"
"Radiation therapy historically has evolved in close symbiosis with the development of faster and more powerful computers;  advanced delivery techniques such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) would not be possible without today's microprocessors.  The quest for better radiation delivery techniques continues to this day, and commands increasingly more powerful machines to handle the calculations required by complex treatment planning algorithms. In order to keep up with the processing requirements of modern algorithms, treatment planning systems (TPS) must sometimes resort to clusters of computers to provide clinical output in reasonable time.  This architecture, although efficient, requires substantial investments in time and expertise, and can hinder the deployment of better TPS for economical and logistical reasons.  It therefore appears that an economical and powerful, yet standalone calculation platform is highly desirable in radiation therapy, and in medical physics in general.  We propose here to develop such a platform, using innovative hardware material dedicated to massively parallel calculations such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). GPUs and similar stream processors such as the Cell Broadband Engine (CBE) have already been used successfully for general-purpose calculations in many scientific fields, achieving speed improvement factors of up to two orders of magnitude over traditional implementations on Central Processing Units (CPUs). We propose to implement medical physics algorithms on stream processors such as GPUs in order to significantly accelerate tasks such as image processing, optimization and dose calculations. This, in turn, will allow the integration of more complex, more accurate and more personalized algorithms in treatment planning systems. The development of such algorithms on stream processors will benefit not only the field of medical radiation physics, but any discipline where high-performance computing is desirable.

"Recent theoretical and technological advances have led to rapid progress in the fields of Landscape Ecology and Behavioral Ecology. My research integrates those two fields of research and is right at their frontier, where new ideas are developed and scrutinized. My lab has been interested in behavioral processes that may explain why forest birds, and increasingly, mammals, occur where they do in boreal forest landscapes. What makes certain birds avoid small and isolated forest patches surrounded by clearcuts? Is it mostly because they have difficulty reaching those habitats in the first place, or simply because those habitats are of poor quality?

My students and I use a combination of simple field experiments, detailed GPS observations of animal movements and distribution, and state-of-the art statistical analysis to answer those questions both with breeding birds and wintering mammals. In the last several years, our research has demonstrated that gaps in the forest created by timber harvest and conversion to agriculture do indeed thwart bird movements and may impact their fitness by , e.g., providing fewer opportunities for breeders to find mates. But recent advances from our lab and the larger scientific community also points to possible roles of fruit-eating in clearcuts adjoining forests and social attraction among individuals previously thought to be rivals, leading to ""neighborhoods"". Those mechanisms have much potential to explain why forest birds are so sensitive to forest patch size. They will be investigated thoroughly in the next 5 years, thanks to NSERC. This research will serve Canadians by its relevance to wildlife conservation vs. timber harvest in the Boreal forest, and by an increased awareness of the intricacies of habitat selection by wildlife.

"This project is a continuation of a previous CRD grant through which we had installed and studied several fast-growing plantations of hybrid poplars in north eastern Canada. We aim to improve our understanding of nutrient requirements of hybrid poplars in the boreal zone using mineral or organic amendment, and understand the role of litter decomposition in pure and mixed plantations on soil fertility and plantation productivity. We also want to understand the specific ecophysiology of different types of hybrid poplars/aspens compared to their native parents, and relate it to fertilization and moisture levels. For regions where the use of exotic species is impossible or prohibited we want to understand the regeneration dynamics and genetic structure of natural balsam poplar stands, in order to be able to use it to devise appropriate propagation/deployment scenarios to reforest natural hardwood stands or to limit its regeneration in areas where it is not desired. The results of this project will allow the Canadian industry to use and cultivate poplars and fast-growing plantations to alleviate wood shortages and new harvesting restrictions on public lands.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"
"Natural root grafting has been seldom studied since the 1960's in North America.  It was however observed to occur in a lot of tree species, and possibly in all species for which roots have been specifically examined.  Root grafting is often viewed as a natural oddity, and its implication in forest ecology and management has been generally disregarded, although most will agree that root connections have great eco-physiological significance. 



Root grafts can act as infection networks for the transmission of diseases such as the dutch elm disease.  They can transfer, to untreated trees, herbicides and fertilizers ('backflash' phenomenon). Root grafts can also confer more wind resistance to a  forest stand, and can affect responses to thinning operations. Because they allow trees to share water, minerals, assimilates and diseases, root grafts most probably play a major role in tree biology and thus should be better understood. 



In this research project, I propose to 1) evaluate the occurrence of root grafts among common boreal tree species (jack pine, black spruce and balsam fir), 2) examine factors enhancing root grafting and dendrochronologically determine the timing of root graft formation, 3) characterize processes involved in translocation of water, nutrients and assimilates through root grafts, and 4) evaluate the impact of silvicultural treatments on tree biology and stand dynamics in relation to root grafting.

"The successfull testing of the electronic power devices and hybrid power sources designed and developed by  professors Dessaint and Al-Haddad requires an accurate representation of the loads specific to particular applications such as  more electric aircrafts (MEA),  hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), auxiliary power supplies (APU), etc. The load dynamics are of great importance on the dimensioning of the electronic power devices and validation of the energy management strategies (EMS). A programmable AC/DC electronic load can represent these dynamics precisely and therefore ensure the robustness and effectiveness of power electronics devices and the associated energy management strategy for all critical scenarios. 

The requested funds will be used to purchase six units of the Chroma 63804 series programmable AC/DC electronic load. Each unit is rated 4.5 kVA and can be connected in parallel. The 6 units will form a 3 phase load of 27 kVA. This rating is sufficient to handle all the power sources to be tested by our research team. Key features of this programmable AC/DC electronic load are constant current, constant power, constant resistance and constant voltage modes, programmable power factor (0 to 1, lead or lag), wide frequency range of operation (45 to 440 Hz, DC), inrush current and short circuit modes and phase imbalanced mode. Finally, the programmable AC/DC electronic load can be remotely controlled via RS-232 and USB interfaces and it integrates high accuracy internal measurements.  Therefore, external measurement instruments will not be required and all data can be retrieved from a single location for the design and validation purposes.

"This project proposes a more efficient and robust power supply for emergency situations in a more electric aircraft (MEA). At first, a hybrid power supply consisting of an air driven genertor (ADG) connected in parallel with a battery pack is considered for the study. Later on, the ADG is replaced by the fuel cells-ultra capacitor system. The main goals of this project are to develop a model of the hybrid power supply and to validate this model using simulation and experimental results.The methodology to achieve the desired goals is the following: The first step will be to model essential loads connected to the ADG. Bombardier will provide information regarding essential loads, flight phases and load sequencing, nominal and peak power requirement associated with the CRJ 900. Based on that information, simplified and generic load models will be developed in SimPowerSystems (SPS). The next section of the project will cover the design, modeling and simulation of the ADG-battery hybrid system. Generic battery and ADG models developed by �TS (�cole de technologie sup�rieure) will be used for the simulation. The next part of this project will be to design, model, simulate and test the hybrid system, which consists of a fuel cell stack in parallel with a battery and/or super capacitors. Generic models of the fuel cell and battery also developed by �TS will be a perfect starting point for the purpose. A reduced prototype of the system will be implemented at the �TS power electronics laboratory in order to determine accurately the model parameters and to validate the model performance. The final part of the project will focus on the modeling of loads such as the transformer rectifier unit (TRU) and the electro-hydrostatic actuator (EHA) which are present in MEA.This project presents a new application of fuel cells in aeronautics. With recent technological advances on fuel cell components (electrodes, membrane and catalysts) and pressurized hydrogen tanks, fuel cells can be considered as potential source in aircraft electrical systems. This project will be beneficial to aircraft companies not only in term of fuel consumption and maintenance, but also environmentally as fuel cells produce power with low toxic emissions.

"This project develops new computer algorithms of 'divide-and-conquer'-type for two important scientific computing applications. The algorithms are made efficient by exploiting representations of the problems on multiple levels with successively coarser resolution.

The first problem deals with the organization and retrieval of large amounts of information, for instance the importance ranking of web pages for search engine queries. Efficient multilevel methods will be derived for so-called Markov chain problems, which provide a model for importance ranking.

The second problem deals with the simulation of highly nonlinear systems of equations, for example models of complex fluid flow around airplanes or in planetary atmospheres. Efficient multilevel methods will be developed for these nonlinear systems, by explicitly isolating the nonlinear singularities from the smooth part of the solution.

The multilevel algorithms to be developed proceed in an iterative way by improving an initial guess of the problem solution over successive cycles. The improvements in each cycle are made efficient by reducing error components with different scales on appropriate progressively coarser levels in a recursive way. This approach can lead to a speedup of several orders of magnitude, compared with more conventional methods. 

The dramatically improved algorithmic efficiency of these multilevel methods will contribute to advancing technological capabilities in our increasingly information-based economy, and will help to extend the boundaries of our scientific understanding, for example in the field of extrasolar planetary atmospheres.

"    )	Our knowledge of the structure and evolution of stars has increased greatly with the advent of high powered digital computers. We have understood the basic life cycle for stars for about four decades now, but our failure to match increasingly refined observations demonstrates that we do not understand everything. For example, the traditional models predict neither the enhancement of the surface abundances of some elements which must be created deep inside the star and transported to the surface nor the correct values for all the observed oscillation periods of stars appreciably more massive than the sun.

    )	Rotation, not included in the traditional models,  has been identified as the possible reason for these discrepancies. This may come not only through the alteration of the stellar structure produced by the rotational force, but also through short and intermediate time scale motion produced by instabilities that rotation can cause. The motion produced by these instabilities transports material and angular momentum throughout the star.  The multi-dimensional calculations proposed in this research can be expected to reproduce the stellar structure adequately for a given angular momentum distribution. With some further development, it is expected that the evolution of the composition and angular momentum distributions produced through these rotational instabilities can be followed as well. This should allow us to narrow the possible angular momentum distribution possibilities that stars have. This redistribution of material and angular momentum begins early in the star's life. Later stages of stellar evolution will be affected by this and this may be the key to understanding some discrepancies between observation and models in these later phases as well.

"Increasingly stringent regulations on airborne pollutant emissions for transportation and power generation are expected in Canada following the trends in Europe and some parts of the United States.  Rising oil prices have further accelerated the search for alternative fuel-efficient and low-emission power generation systems. Although renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly important for both transportation and power generation, these sectors will rely on large-scale combustion for the foreseeable future.  Accordingly, novel combustion devices must be developed that can run on different fuels (including blended fuels), maintain optimal operating conditions and minimize airborne pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and soot.

A series of numerical investigations will be conducted to predict the behaviour of turbulent flames burning different fuel blends. Emphasis will be on including detailed chemistry in the calculations, and more accurate modeling of turbulence-combustion interactions. 

It is proposed to investigate the capabilities of our novel turbulent combustion model, CMC, in the context of non-premixed and partially-premixed combustion to accurately reproduce ignition, flame stabilization and formation of pollutants, such as NOx and soot. LES and RANS solvers will be tested and compared with respect to computational cost and the accuracy of the final predictions. The numerical results will be evaluated using a set of well-defined experimental data for high-pressure combustion in a shock tube and lifted and attached jet flames exhibiting various levels of extinction The proposed research program will focus on the accurate prediction of ignition delay and location, temperature field, flame location for lifted flames, NOx and soot concentrations. 

The results of the proposed work will immediately benefit engineers in the automotive, aero, and power generation sectors, since they will allow the prediction and investigation of flame stability and airborne pollutant emissions in novel combustion devices.

"The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) is an international multi-disciplinary scientific endeavour involving more than twenty countries and requiring an operational budget of about 150 M USD/year for 2008 and beyond. IODP explores the Earth's system as recorded in seafloor sediments and rocks and is a successor to the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP, 1968-1983) and the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP, 1985-2003), which have been among the most successful international collaborative science programs ever conducted and have revolutionized the understanding of the Earth history. IODP offers the international community for the first time access to multiple drilling platforms, including a ""state-of-the-art"" riser drill ship. IODP will allow access to regions previously off limits to the DSDP/ODP, such as the Arctic, shallow seas, and oil and gas bearing sediments. These new capabilities promise unparalled scientific insights into the earth system, and will allow us to address key questions regarding climate changes, solid earth geodynamics, and biodiversity. Phase I of IODP (2003-2008) already provided significant discoveries, notably about the role of the Arctic in moderating climate changes, the extent of marine gas hydrate reservoirs along Cascadia margins, and the drilling of the deep ocean crust to the gabbroic layer.

This application requests funds to continue and increase Canadian participation in IODP during Phase II, which begins in summer 2008. Among the IODP activities the Canadian scientific community aims at promoting and leading during Phase II, there are drilling expeditions in the Beaufort Sea and Arctic Ocean to address questions of gas hydrates and climate dynamics under a warmer globe, along the eastern and western Canadian margins to address issues of geological hazards, and at key offshore sites to investigate the deep biosphere and the earth's interior.

One addresses a critical element of the climate-ocean system: the linkage between the Arctic and North Atlantic oceans and its impact on large-scale oceanic circulation changes. The other is methodological and concerns the use of fossil algae (dinoflagellate cysts = dinocysts) from marine sediments to reconstruct changes in hydrographic conditions at high latitudes. The ultimate goal of the research is to produce the best possible reconstructions of past climate and ocean synopses during the last two million years, with special attention paid to warm episodes, to support predictive climate-ocean modeling efforts. Long sedimentary records will thus be examined to identify intervals that have been free of perennial Arctic sea-ice and evaluate the impact of reduced sea-ice and Greenland ice volume on the climate and oceanic circulation in the NW North Atlantic. Detailed analyses of sediment cores spanning the present interglacial (the last 11,000 yrs) will be made to examine natural variability of the Arctic sea-ice and NW North Atlantic hydrography, and to explore the millennial pacing and linkages between Arctic sea-ice production and freshwater-meltwater export into the North Atlantic. Finally, some attention will be given to records spanning the last centuries in order to improve the accuracy of dinocysts as tracers of sea-ice and hydrographic conditions and to evaluate the impact of human activities, particularly in estuarine and coastal areas that are affected by eutrophication. Sedimentary records to be used include cores collected during the international expeditions of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) in the North Atlantic (2004), the HOTRAX expedition in the Arctic Ocean (2005), and the International Polar Year ""WarmPast"" project in Fram Strait, which is the main sill between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. This research is conducted through collaboration for the setting of chronologies, the reconstruction of climate and ocean parameters, and climate-ocean model assessment. From a methodological point of view, my contribution mostly concerns dinocysts and their use as tracers of sea-surface conditions (sea-ice, temperature, salinity, productivity).

"The mammalian female ovary is a heterogeneous organ containing the female germ cells (eggs, oocytes) enclosed in complex structures (follicles), whose ultimate purpose is to provide oocytes capable of being fertilized and producing healthy offspring. There are multiple stages of follicle development and differentiation through which ovarian follicles must pass before producing a mature oocyte. Through signals that come from within or outside the ovary, a steady state of follicular development and growth is established with respect to numbers and types of growing follicles. But the majority of follicles stay dormant, in the earliest stages, waiting for their turn.  The mechanisms underlying early follicle development remain poorly understood. Thus, the long-term goal of the proposed research program is to elucidate the mechanisms involved in inter-cellular and inter-follicular interactions that maintain steady-state populations of ovarian follicles. Investigations will explore the role(s) of members of the Transforming Growth Factor-beta superfamily of growth/inhibitory factors and their receptors in regulating ovarian follicular development. This is being accomplished by manipulating follicle populations using both mouse ovaries cultured outside the body and exposing mice to things that specifically kill certain stages of ovarian follicles.  Studies are also examining which enzymes are active in the oocyte which maintain its health.  The research program will provide greater understanding of molecular signaling involved in ovarian physiology, which will impact both our basic concepts of reproductive biology and the tools we have for use in the clinical setting.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Integrative Animal Biology"
"Vibrio  parahaemolyticus is a significant cause of gastroenteritis resulting from the consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish. V. parahaemolyticus accumulates in bivalve invertebrates, particularly oysters and mussels. There is a large amount of diversity within V. parahaemolyticus isolates, and the aresenal of factors required for virulence is not well understood. V. parahaemolytics does not cause disease in adult oysters, and is thought to be part of the oyster normal flora. The V. parahaemolyticus genome encodes two type III secretion systems. Type III secretion systems are mult-protein complexes used by Gram negative bacteria to inject proteins directly into the host cell. They are commonly found in animal and plant pathogens, and are considered important virulence factors. Surprisingly, data from our lab indicates that one of the type III secretion systems, the CI-T3SS, is found in both disease-associated and environmental isolates. This led us to hypothesize that the CI-T3SS is involved in colonization and survival within oysters. In this proposal, we examine the interaction between V. parahaemolyticus and the oyster immune system. Bacteria that live in close association with a host need to avoid recognition as foreign by the immune system. The oyster immune system is comprised of phagocytic cells called hemocytes. Our data suggests that V. parahaemolyticus evades phagocytosis, which could enable it to survive within the oyser. We will therefore examine whether the CI-T3SS plays a role in avoiding phagocytosis. A second aim is to determine whether the CI-T3SS is required for persistent colonization of the oyster. Collectively, these studies will allow us to better understand the marine lifestyle of V. parahaemolyticus. As virulence in V. parahaemolyticus is not well defined, methods for eliminating V. parahaemolyticus from oysters before they go to market is an important strategy to decrease the risk of disease. Understanding how V. parahaemolyticus persists in oysters will enhance our ability to develop these tools.","Medical and health sciences","Cell Biology"
"The upstream oil and gas industry in Canada emits about 2000 metric tonnes of benzene to the atmosphere per year. This is a cause for concern because benzene is carcinogenic. Current regulations for benzene emission from glycol dehydration units in this sector are not being enforced due to a lack of suitable emission reduction technique. The problem lies in the fact that the emission comes from a large number of small sources, making conventional technology unfeasible.

A promising technique to reduce benzene emissions from small sources is biofiltration. Biofiltration is the biological degradation of a pollutant from a waste gas mediated by microorganisms in a medium like compost or peat. An increasing number of laboratory studies on biofiltration of benzene and related substances have been reported recently. Based on a simulation model I published recently (De Visscher and Li, 2008), the effective use of biofiltration for reducing benzene emissions from glycol dehydration units offers much promise. The remaining question at this point is that few studies have studied biofiltration at the high benzene concentrations that occur in this type of waste gas. Based on my experience on methane biofiltration and my design expertise, I plan to confirm the feasibility of this process in the lab, and to design a full scale benzene biofilter. A Calgary based manufacturer of environmentally responsible storage tanks has the capability to construct the biofilter housing, and will be involved in the scale-up of the biofilter once the concept is proven in the lab. If successful, it will be possible to reduce benzene emissions from glycol dehydration units by 90%.

Based on air dispersion modeling I plan to determine the environmental impact of improved benzene emission reduction on the air quality in Western Canada. Based on risk analysis it is then possible to calculate the social cost saving of the resulting improved air quality. By comparing this social cost saving with the cost of treating the benzene emissions, it will be possible to determine rationally if this technology is economically viable.

"I intend to pursue a broad research program in combinatorics, encompassing a variety of topics from arithmetic combinatorics to colourings of graphs.  Though the subject matter is varied, there is a common theme running throughout: the search for structural explanations to exceptional behavior.  Such structure theorems are among the most useful in combinatorics, since they provide us with very strong information when they apply.  



Perhaps my favorite research topic is the study of small growth/expansion in groups and graphs.  Here the central problem is quite easy to state in its most basic form: if A,B are finite subsets of a (multiplicative) group G and |AB| is small relative to |A| and |B|, what can we say about the structure of A,B, and G?  Two famous theorems give us powerful answers to this question in special cases.  Frieman's Theorem (a founding theorem in arithmetic combinatorics) gives us a rough structure for subsets of integers A for which |A+A| < c|A|.  Gromov's Theorem (a founding theorem in geometric group theory) shows that every finitely generated group of polynomial growth has a finite index subgroup which is nilpotent.  A major problem in this area is that of unifying these two theorems.  Although this goal appears quite far off, there are a variety of more tractable combinatorial problems to solve along the way.  



I also intend to pursue some structural problems in graph theory.  One particularly interesting topic is that of perfect matchings in cubic graphs.  Many famous theorems, such as The Four Colour Theorem, Edmond's Matching Polytope Theorem, and Lovasz' Matching Lattice Theorem, give us useful information about this topic.  However, our understanding of the behavior of small numbers of perfect matchings is still quite limited, and I believe there is progress to be made here.  In addition to this topic, I intend to investigate structural digraph theory, and some problems in graph colouring, and topological graph theory.

"There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that eating habits in animals are greatly affected by learning early in life. Researchers have proposed that this type of learning may have two outcomes: first, if eating habits learned early in life are very different from what is needed later on in life, inefficiencies in ingestion may occur, and second, it may be possible to manipulate past dietary experience in a manner that positively shapes the dietary habits of the animals to improve production, efficiency and health. Despite increases in milk production due largely to improved genetics and nutrition by dairy cattle, these animals continually experience a high incidence of metabolic conditions. One of these conditions, rumen acidosis, may be directly linked to their feeding behaviour. Those feeding behaviours, which may result in acidosis, are strongly influenced in adult ruminants by environmental factors such as food availability and social conditions. It is very possible that these factors may also be very influential for young ruminants, in particular in the learning of feeding behaviour. The domesticated intensively-raised immature Holstein dairy animal is an ideal model to study the learning of feeding behaviour as all aspects of their rearing are manipulated through human intervention. Research in the area of dietary learning has been almost exclusively limited to rodent models with little research addressing domesticated food-producing animals. The limited work on ruminants has focussed primarily on extensively-raised animals, such as sheep and beef cattle. The long-term objective of the proposed research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the learning of feeding behaviour in immature dairy cattle. Short term objectives are to 1) evaluate how access to food sources impacts the learning of feeding behaviour, 2) evaluate how environmental factors impact the learning of feeding behaviour, and 3) determine if learned feeding behaviour, arising from early life experiences, persists through weaning and through the growing phase of life. The results of this research program will provide novel biological insights into factors affecting the learning of feeding behaviour in growing dairy heifers and the long-term implications of this learning.

"Surface interactions are ubiquitous in all aspects of life: the air-lung interface enables breathing; the cell surface governs whether drugs can interact with and penetrate bacterial membranes; the aerosol/particle surface governs cloud formation and the chemistry of reactions of pollutants; the surface of a material defines its functionality (e.g. biocompatibilty or ultrahydrophobicity). These are all controlled by weak, non-bonding interactions between molecules. 



Thus, knowledge of interfacial structure and the nature of interactions between surface-active components allows us to understand, predict and control interfacial processes. We have three main areas of research: First is the fundamental understanding of the biophysical nature of cellular processes and the role on interfacial lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions. We then use our knowledge of the lateral organization of lipid films and their specific binding properties for the design of functional materials, in particular nanopatterned films and coatings with biocompatible properties and/or the ability to tether specific protein substrates. Finally, knowledge of reactions at interfaces has led to our development of a new experimental approach for determining the contribution of surface reactions in the processing atmospheric aerosols. The changes in interfacial properties ultimately govern their participation in atmospheric processes such as the scattering and absorption of incoming solar radiation, and cloud formation. This will build on our recent progress in studying lipid raft formation in biological membranes, ozonolysis at surfaces and (nano)structured surfaces.



This research will use state-of-the art structural surface chemistry techniques to address areas of key importance to health, the environment and the materials of everyday life.

"The phloem (or bast) fibres of crops such as hemp and flax are remarkably strong and long, with a tensile strength greater than steel, on a per-weight basis.  We are interested in learning how flax and hemp develop such long, strong cells, and how the properties of these cells might be optimized to make environmentally friendly textiles and building materials from flax stems, which are now largely treated as a waste product on the approximately 800,000 hectares of Canadian farmland that grows flax for its oil.  The length of phloem fibres is affected by an interesting process called intrusive growth, whereby cells grow in between surrounding cells.  Although intrusive growth is relatively well characterized in animals, for example, during nerve development, it is less common in plants.  Previous work in our laboratory has used techniques called microarray analysis and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to identify genes associated with fibre development in flax and hemp.  The genes we identified are mostly involved in the development of the fibre cell wall, and we are currently characterizing some of these genes in detail.  In the proposed research, we would like to look more specifically at the genes that control the length and number of fibre cells that develop in the phloem of flax and hemp. We will again use microarray analysis, as well as various types of mutant screening to identify these genes, and subsequently characterize their function.  One immediate outcome of the screening process will be the identification of flax varieties that are easier to harvest, which will reduce the need for environmentally undesirable practices such as straw-burning.  In the long term, our research will lead to an improved understanding of how plant cells develop and communicate, and this information will help breeders develop flax and hemp crops with optimized fibre properties for new industries.","Plant production and plant primary products","Plant Biology & Food Science"
"There are three primary objectives of this research: (1) to develop new tools and sensors for sampling the coastal and open ocean, (2) to use data collected to expand our understanding of circulation dynamics on the shelf and in the Northwest Atlantic and (3) to apply the data collected, and the understanding and models developed, to problems of ocean ecosystem dynamics. The time scales of interest range from the near-inertial to the seasonal and the interannual.

    )	The approach of this research is to integrate observational oceanographic studies with numerical modeling. Key features of the work are the development of new approaches to sampling, integration of the data and models, and the use of the models to interpret the data. The primary geographic focus of sea studies will be the continental shelf of the Northwest Atlantic: (1) the fjords and coastal embayments of Newfoundland and Labrador (2) the Northeast Newfoundland shelf and (3) the banks on the continental shelf of the Northwest Atlantic. Historical data will be supplemented with new data from dedicated research cruises and mooring deployments and from the use of new sampling systems such as ocean gliders. Numerical models of the physical dynamics, coupled with biological models of production of phytoplankton, zooplankton and ichthyoplankton, will be tested against observations. Modelling will be central to developing understanding of both the physical and biophysical dynamics. This research should also lead to operational tools for further study and for ocean management. 

    )	The novelty of this work lies in the combination of the experimental, data analysis and numerical modeling approaches. This work will integrate new observational techniques with models to strengthen our understanding of coastal ocean dynamics in a region where the seasonal signal is the strongest, at mid-latitudes. We seek to bridge the gap between event forcing and the seasonal and interannual response to resolve problems of coastal oceanography and to explore the application of such understanding.

"This research program aims to develop technical solutions that will improve the quality and acquisition speed of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). One way to achieve these improvements is to make the large magnets on which MRI is based much stronger. However this solution comes at great financial cost. This research program aims to take advantage of recent improvements in data acquisition systems that have allowed MRI scanners to receive using greater numbers of multiple antenna-like sensors (""array coils"") than ever before (think of megapixels in a digital camera). Array coils with large numbers of elements make optimal use of existing MRI field strengths and offer improvements in image quality and acquisition speed over those from arrays with fewer elements. However, building such large arrays is a challenging task due to the need to connect individual cables to each of the array's loop-shaped elements. The additional cables further contribute to ""crosstalk"" between the loops (think of trying to listen to one conversation from a distance in a room crowded with people). As the loop dimensions shrink the amplifiers connected to the loops are no longer ideal as current design methods assume. The objective of this research program is to optimize the performance of large arrays for MRI and take full advantage of existing MRI field strengths by improving the design methods and using fiber-optics to eliminate the problems caused by the increasing number of cables.

"Electronics - suitably adapted for applications in liquids - have tremendous potential for yielding low cost, high performance, compact, integrated devices for biological and chemical applications.  Our general goal is to tap into this potential and push the frontier of electroanalytical chemistry.  Given 1) our interdisciplinary expertise (we have group members who have degrees in chemistry, physics, biophysics, electrical and nano engineering and we have established collaborations with experts in biomolecular systems) and 2) our track record studying nanostructured electronics, we are strategically positioned to make a significant contribution in this field.  



To demonstrate the utility of circuit methods in chemistry and biology in a dramatic way, we will build and study circuits with an important critical element: bacteria.  In a series of experiments, we will study circuits with a single bacterium and circuits with arrays of individual bacteria.  Circuit boards will be fashioned using optical lithography and will then be used to trap and study the bacteria in liquids.  Electronic studies of a single bacterium have not been conducted before and promise to set a new benchmark for sensitivity.  Questions we will address include: Can we distinguish between a live and dead bacterium? Can we monitor bacterial response to various chemical stimuli? Can we identify the type of bacterium?  We anticipate that our work will lead to significant advances in electroanalytical chemistry, potentially providing new insight into microbiology as well as improved bacteria sensors.

"This research proposal is concerned with the analysis and optimization of systems performance over their life-cycle: from the design stage to the recovery and reuse stage. In a context of increased competition and rationalization, performance gains can ensure competitiveness, profitability and increase customer service. Particularly, this research program focuses on modeling and optimizing the performance for systems subjected to random failures in an environment-friendly context. Systems performance is defined and evaluated as one or the combination of several of the following indicators: reliability, availability, maintainability, energy consumption, quality, etc. This performance is affected by the system's design, production and assembly processes, distribution, operating environment, integrated logistics, maintenance, etc. It is therefore required to model the system in order to identify the main factors which reduce its performance and develop decision-tools for the selection of performance improvement actions. Research actions will be dedicated to defining the performance factors and their assessment at different stages in the life-cycle. Which should, subsequently, help analyzing and modeling the system behavior. This research program consists of 6 main topics: 1-Development of performance monitoring, assessment and optimization models. 2- Reliability and availability modeling for multi-components systems subjected to random failures. 3-Provisioning strategies integrating the recent development of connective technologies. 4- Maintenance strategies combining the use of new and reconditioned replacement parts. 5- Development of decision-making models and tools for the selection of optimal recovery options for retired systems. 6- Life Cycle Engineering.

perform a high-throughput comparison of the proteins from the two conditions. Candidates will be

bioinformatically analyzed to delineate their biological functions in the context of DS, and will be further

validated with clinical samples. The novel markers may have the potential to increase the predictive value of

"Seabirds make up less than three percent of all the bird species in the world, testifying to the rigours imposed by a life predominantly at sea. Feeding far from land and bringing food back to feed the chick imposes on seabirds a suite of characters that occur separately in some other birds but are found together only in seabirds, leading to the recognition of a ""seabird syndrome"": high survival (long lifespan), low reproductive rate, prolonged period of sexual maturation, colonial nesting, monogamy, biparental care, and sexual monomorphism (males and females similar). 

Frigatebirds are quintessential seabirds but lack two components of the ""seabird syndrome"":  equal sex ratios and sexual monomorphism. Males and females differ markedly in size (females are larger) and in appearance - males are iridescent black with a large red inflatable throat pouch used in a spectacular courtship display; usually courting males outnumbered prospective female mates. All five species of frigatebird are different from all other species in this respect, and yet exploit the same demanding lifestyle. 

This proposal sets out to explain at least part of this puzzling paradox, focusing on two questions: why are the sexes so different? What leads to the unequal adult sex ratios observed in these species? Possible reasons include different diets or feeding areas, which we will explore using telemetry and biochemical (stable-isotope) analysis of blood samples; different roles in nesting, promoting agility (and thus small size) in the males (which collect all the nesting material while in flight, demanding extreme aerial agility); and the different costs of raising large (female) versus small (male) chicks. This research will contribute to a better understanding not only of seabird biology but also of the evolutionary processes leading to different parental roles in birds and other animals.

"Vibrio cholerae causes the often-fatal disease cholera, which has a long grim history and still affects many millions of people, mostly in the developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America.  In this dangerous human pathogen, the circulation of sodium is intimately related to virulence.  Therefore, investigation of sodium circulation in this bacterium is very important from both scientific and medical point of view.  The sodium circulation in V. cholerae relies on specific proteins called Na+/H+ antiporters.  These antiporters are usually single membrane proteins removing toxic sodium ions from the cell in exchange for external protons. 



     The proposed program is focused on the study of Vc-Mrp and Vc-NhaP1, two unusual Na+/H+ antiporters from V. cholerae.  The first (Vc-Mrp) is a very complex multi-protein transport system which expels not only sodium or lithium, but also potassium from the bacterial cell and, most intriguingly, also enhances the resistance of bacteria to bile, thus possibly boosting colonization of the gut by V. cholerae in the course of infection.  The proposed research will help to clarify if Vc-Mrp is actually a novel type of so-called multi-drug resistance pump. The second (Vc-NhaP1) is genetically similar to Na+/H+ antiporters, but its elimination by genetic means renders bacteria sensitive to potassium rather than sodium, suggesting that it may actually be a potassium transporter contributing in a completely different way to the ion homeostasis in V. cholerae. 

 

     Proposed studies will advance our understanding of Na+ circulation in V. cholerae in relation to its pathogenicity and help to identify new prospective targets for anti-cholera remedies.

"We study possible signatures of dark matter particles in cosmic rays. The majority of cosmic rays observed on Earth is generated by supernovae and their remnants, and by active galactic nuclei. However, there is a prospect that dark matter particles contribute to some extent to the cosmic ray flux. Dark matter particles may eventually decay or annihilate, and these events would generate cosmic rays. 

The search for dark matter in cosmic rays is a particularly interesting problem, because cosmic rays provide a particle physics ""laboratory"" with energies per particle which exceed energies in our most powerful terrestrial laboratories by a factor of 100 million. We study promising extensions of the Standard Model of Particle Physics which make predictions for the masses and abundances of dark matter particles, and calculate expected cosmic ray fluxes from reactions of these particles. In a related research project, we also develop a novel method to determine the dark matter and energy content of the universe from the quasar catalog provided by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

"This proposal will support new investigations into the theory of computational intelligence and machine learning, and their application to modeling software reliability. Our principal theoretical contributions will be in the new area of ""complex fuzzy logic,"" a recently proposed generalization of fuzzy logic. Complex fuzzy logic is a novel multi-valued logic, whose truth values are complex numbers. Little is currently known about the properties of this logic, or how it might be applied. Our program of research will address both of these questions, by developing both the mathematical-logic foundations of complex fuzzy logic, and inductive learning algorithms that apply complex fuzzy logic to practical problems. We believe that complex fuzzy logic will be particularly effective for time series forecasting. Our research into machine learning will focus on stratification, a method for reducing skewness in machine learning datasets. Stratification algorithms delete samples from the majority class and/or add examples to the minority class, removing or reducing skewness. We will investigate generalizations of various stratification algorithms, and their implementation in the high-performance computing environments commonly used in business intelligence.

  Our theoretical contributions will be applied to modeling certain aspects of software reliability. We will investigate the use of stratification algorithms for software defect prediction. There is virtually no existing work on the use of stratification in software defect prediction. We will provide new evidence in this area through extensive experimental investigation. Another aspect of software reliability is software reliability growth modeling (SRGM). In previous work we have investigated the use of chaos theory for SRGM. We will continue that investigation, and we will also apply our new inductive learning algorithms for complex fuzzy logic. These approaches are highly novel, and we expect that our methods will significantly improve upon current SRGM techniques. Our contributions will benefit the Canadian intelligent systems industry by providing new theoretical guidance and a cohort of HQP trained in intelligent systems.

"The human shoulder is a complex joint that is the site of different sorts of tissue damage. The nature of this damage depends on how various tasks cause specific tissues to be exposed to physical loads. Determining how this occurs is important but not straightforward. To address the problem, my research program has developed a computerized shoulder model that provides unique insight into the exposures associated with daily activities. Although the model has unique capabilities, further improvement in describing these exposures is possible, particularly if experimental data is leveraged in the process.

    )	My group will accomplish this through four major focus areas: 

1) Strategic model development, focusing on more realistic muscle and ligament representations.

2) Extended model validations for meaningful activities, including rigorous sensitivity analysis and evaluating both maximal and overhead exertions.

3) Development of a new joint-specific muscular coactivation approach to help predict muscular activity,  initially for the elbow, and then for the shoulder.

4) Creation of a sophisticated, innovative 3-D muscular activity map for manual activities.

    )	Pursuing these research themes will improve exposure assessment for shoulder tissues. Without accurate estimates of shoulder exposures, it is impossible to identify situations that could lead to debilitating injury. Unless we acquire this knowledge, we are powerless to design environments or activities to limit risks of damage or injury. This research has the power to provide improved, highly relevant exposure estimates and move the field of shoulder biomechanics towards new and important insights into the function and nature of shoulder loading and injury mechanisms. It directly benefits Canada by improving the health and productivity of all Canadians at home and work through developing fundamental knowledge of the complex shoulder.","Biomedical engineering","Mechanical Engineering - A"

"We propose the completion of a Crustal Formation Age Map for the Grenville Province. This work uses Nd isotope analysis to estimate the time when different segments of the Canadian Shield were first created as microcontinents above subduction zones. These microcontinents were subsequently amalgamated together in collisional orogenies, (ancient mountain belts) to form the continents as we know them.

The Grenville geological province of the Canadian Shield was involved in a major continental collision about a billion years ago, analogous to the modern Himalayas. The extent of metamorphism associated with this collision defines the geological extent of the Grenville Province. However, like the Himalayas, the continents involved in this mountain-building event were much older than the collision itself. In our previous work, we have shown that the Grenville Province contains several large crustal terranes, each covering tens of thousands of square km, and with ages of ca. 2.7, 1.9, 1.75, 1.5 and 1.25 billion years.

The total area of the province is ca, 500,000 square km, so it takes many years of work to map the age structure of such a vast area, even at a reconnaissance level. We have made much progress in this work over the past 20 years, and another 5 years will see this project approach completion, including mapping the boundaries between these terranes so that they can be identified on the ground.

In order to unify this large body of data into an accessible form for other researchers, and to facilitate the production of a Crustal Formation Age Map, we are entering all of the Nd isotope data into a GIS data base. This will allow digital contouring of age data for comparison with other geological evidence of crustal structure. The final result will be a much improved understanding of the geological evolution of this part of the Canadian Shield, including an improved understanding of its potential to host economic ore deposits.","Earth sciences","Solid Earth Sciences"

"The weedy shrubs and small trees known as hawthorns (the genus Crataegus L., in the rose family) have

well-established uses in natural health products (NHPs), and a handful of Eurasian species have demonstrated

efficacy in treating symptoms of chronic heart failure. Until recently, however, almost nothing was known

about the NHP potential of native North American hawthorns, of which approximately 50 occur in Canada.

Currently, almost all hawthorn-based NHPs manufactured in Canada are produced from imported raw materials

obtained from Eurasian species. The NHP industry uses the ratio of flavonoids to vitexins as a standard

indicator of raw material quality. Our preliminary work has demonstrated that by this criterion the leaves,

flowers, and fruits of hawthorns from the southern interior of British Columbia can meet or exceed the quality

of imported hawthorn raw materials. However, accurate morphological identification of hawthorn species can

be challenging, not the least because it usually requires information from collections of both flowers and fruits

from the same individual. Typically these collections cannot be made less than two months apart. We propose

to lay the foundation for the agroforestry exploitation of native hawthorn species by developing methods for the

analysis, traceability, and authentication of NHPs derived from Canadian hawthorn species by using DNA

barcodes and microsatellite fingerprints, by deploying new methods of chemical analysis, and by developing

and optimizing methodologies to aid in their production. Because little is known about either hawthorn NHP

functional components or their mode of action, this project will document these aspects by seeking to (1)

confirm heart and cardiovascular protective properties in an established rodent model and (2) elucidate their

mode of action. Close collaboration with our industry partner, the West Kootenay Herb Growers Cooperative,

will ensure that our efforts are focused on enhancing its ability to exploit Canadian biodiversity in an

environmentally and socially responsible way.

"The discovery of catalytic ribonucleic acids (RNA) redefined the role of RNA in biochemistry. Despite the significant progress in RNA structure determination the detailed mechanisms by which RNA mediated catalysis is achieved and their evolutionary origins remain elusive. At the same time RNA is a very attractive target for the development of new tools and technologies due to the ease with which novel RNA-ligand interactions and catalytic functionalities can be developed via in vitro selection approaches.

Here we propose to investigate the chemical basis for the catalytic potential of RNA and its potential applications as biosensors and analytical tool development. 

We will initially use two RNA systems for the proposed studies, the natural VS ribozyme, and the in vitro selected malachite green binding RNA aptamer, which we have recently engineered in to a primitive ribozyme. The specific aims of the research proposed here are:

(1) Expanding the catalytic repertoire of a small RNA.  

(2) Understanding the relationship of assembly and catalytic competence in the VS ribozyme.

(3) Investigating the potential for RNA based biosensors by combining the catalytic potential of RNA with its highly specific ligand recognitions capabilities. 

In a broader context the project proposed here will lead to new insights into the role RNA might have played in the origin of life. The studies will also help to lay the groundwork for a systematic design of new ribozymes and aptamers with altered specificities that can be used as novel tools in biochemical analytics, synthetic chemistry, and nanotechnology.

"Construction of long (to 60km), large (>10m) diameter tunnels for rail, road and hydraulic networks is a $30 billion industry worldwide. Many of these tunnels traverse highly foliated or laminated ground conditions. Other tunnels, in hard rocks, experience induced anisotropy (spalling). These conditions, combined with anisotropic stresses can generate high anomalous loads and moments in liners and arch support. Canadian companies are involved in many of these overseas projects and a number of projects encounter similar conditions in Canada (Niagara-Beck tunnel, La Ronde Mine, Highway tunnels in B.C). This proposal combines a synthesis of international experience, behavioural testing and state-of-the-art numerical analysis, to better constrain ground response predictions and optimize support design in order to provide competitive benefit to Canadian tunnelling and mine development. The research plan involves 7 new graduate theses (4 MSc, 3 PhD), plus the completion of  3 thesis projects already in progress, organized into 5 project themes:

A) Optimize conventional tools to analyze rockmass and tunnel liner response in laminated/sheared ground in the Niagara-Beck (Ont) and Driskos (Greece) tunnels. (1MSc+1PhD)

B) Develop and validate models for initiation and development of induced anisotropy (spalling) in hard massive rockmasses under high stress. (1MSc+1PhD)

C) Develop field assessment techniques for mechanical parameters in laminated rockmasses and combine with lab testing to provide input for anisotropic strength and post yield deformation parameters. (1MSc+1PhD)

D) Develop constitutive models for anisotropic yield, flow and dilation. Compare 2D/3D model performance against tunneling case histories including Lyon-Turin, Italy and Yacambu, Venezuela. (1MSc+1PhD)

E) Establish the state-of the-art for mine development ground-support design in naturally and induced anisotropic rock and develop advanced integrated design guidelines for large tunnels through analysis of case histories incorporating new technologies from tasks A-D.

"Starless cores represent the initial conditions of star formation and observational characterization of these cores is critical to understand stellar evolution.  For example, recent observations have shown a striking similarity between the starless core mass distribution and the stellar Initial Mass Function, suggesting that stellar mass (and subsequent stellar evolution) is determined by physical processes within parent clouds that form cores.  My recent research has focused on detailed observations of several starless cores, yielding new constraints for models of core formation and evolution.  This proposal seeks ONLY support for a graduate student at the University of Victoria to become involved in exciting new projects only now possible with upcoming instrumental opportunities.  These projects will include obtaining unprecedentedly large samples of starless cores from nearby star-forming molecular clouds with the new JCMT instruments SCUBA-2 and HARP and the new HSO instruments PACS and SPIRE, allowing definitive conclusions to be finally made about core structures, dynamics and masses.

"Recent large-scale neutrino experiments like SNO and SuperK confirmed evidence for neutrino oscillations that can only occur if the neutrino is a massive particle. However, the nature of the neutrino involved in the process is still unclear (Dirac, Majorana), as well as the absolute neutrino masses and their ordering. Good access to these questions can be gained through neutrino-less double beta decay.  If an uncontroversial detection of such a decay can be discovered, it is clear that lepton number conservation is broken, however it would be still unclear what mechanism leads to this form of decay.  The search for such a decay is presently a hot topic of research and is being carried out or planned in a number of experiments, such as EXO, MAJORANA, GERDA, CUORE, COBRA, NEMO-III and SNO+. The 0beta decay rate depends on the neutrino mass but, also on a complex nuclear matrix element, making the extraction of the effective neutrino mass heavily dependent on the nuclear model. The present program is geared towards the measurement of the EC branching ratios (BR), one of the one-leg branches needed to test nuclear models and matrix element calculations. We propose such BR measurements using the TITAN ion trap facility at the TRIUMF ISAC facility. The measurements will be carried out by an international collaboration. It will make use of the existing TITAN system, together with a novel isobar separator system provided by the University of Giessen & GSI Darmstadt. This will ensure mono-isotopic, hence background free samples, can be stored in the EBIT Penning trap. During the decay, electrons will be confined by the magnetic field of the trap. Beta-detectors are provided by the collaboration partner TU Munich, and K-shell X-rays from EC will be detected by seven X-ray detectors located around the trap, provided by the University of Muenster. This new measurement scheme will be providing orders of magnitude background suppression and thus an ideal low-BR measurement environment. The experimental program is accepted by the TRIUMF experimental evaluation committee with high priority (E1066) and is ready for beam taking in 2009.","Physical sciences","Subatomic Physics"
"The mass of the atomic nucleus is one of the most fundamental properties of such many body systems. Precise mass measurements serve as a testing ground for nuclear theory and models and stimulate their further improvements. They are required for weak interaction studies in nuclear beta-decay, and for sensitive tests of nuclear structure at the extremes. Moreover, in the field of nuclear astro-physics, atomic masses are needed for an understanding of the synthesis of the heavier elements in the universe.   

TITAN (TRIUMF's Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear science) is a multi-ion trap system installed at the radioactive ion beam facility ISAC. TITAN is able to carry out mass measurements of very high precision, with delta m ~1 keV, (or a relative precision of 1-10-8) even for isotopes with short half-lives (a tenth of a second) and for isotopes very far from the valley of stability. TITAN is installed at the TRIUMF National Laboratory for Particle and Nuclear Physics, and is uniquely positioned to carry out some of the most demanding high precision experiments in nuclear physics. 

The uniqueness of the system lies in the combination of different kind of ion traps, a combination nowhere else available, and the coupling of this system to ISAC as a source of the most intense radioactive beams of very exotic nuclei worldwide. ISAC is by now operational for more than 5 years, and has proven to deliver a broad variety of radioactive species with unsurpassed production yields. The production of the most exotic isotopes, like 11Li is over a factor 50 higher than elsewhere.

Experiments with TITAN are starting in 2007.

"The TRIUMF Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear science (TITAN) facility is a multi-component ion trap system that provides unique research possibilities in the fields of atomic, nuclear, neutrino and particle physics. The system is set up for maximum performance with short-lived radioactive nuclei, and hence provides an ideal tool for experiments at ISAC, the world's premier exotic beam facility, located at TRIUMF. Proposed experiments to be carried out with TITAN include high precision mass determination for aid in testing the Standard Model of Particle Physics, to test the behavior of nuclei far away from the valley of stability, to gain better understanding of halo nuclei, atomic nuclei with a 'neutron skin'. Other experiments will use the unique features of TITAN to measure precisely for the first time transition matrix elements of nuclei that are of key interest in the search for neutrino-less double beta decay. TITAN will also provide unprecedented possibilities for laser spectroscopy, to gain information of the structure of nuclei. TITAN allows experiments on the forefront of fundamental research and provides unique science opportunity for the Canadian and international research community.

"The research program that this application will support is the examination of nutrient bioavailability and primary production in Lake Simcoe. Lake Simcoe is the largest inland lake in Ontario and the ice-fishing capital of Canada. It is also the source of drinking water to 8 municipalities and is under the threat of increased nutrient inputs. To date, primary production has never been measured on Lake Simcoe, and there has been no assessment of the microbial food web. Algae, or phytoplankton, form the base of the food web in lakes and understanding their primary production will determine the possible fish production in the lake. The main objective of this research program is to determine the limiting nutrient(s) to the phytoplankton communities in Lake Simcoe and the differences in primary production. This is being assessed with a thorough, year-round examination of microbial biomass, physiology and metabolism. If we can understand what controls the cycling of C, perhaps we can predict and mitigate the seasonal hypoxia and restore the cold-water fisheries to Lake Simcoe. This program currently involves 7 highly qualified personnel (HQP) including a postdoctoral fellow, 2 masters students, 2 undergraduate summer students and 2 technicians. This application is for four independent pieces of equipment required for the proposed research. The YSI Sonde is a field instrument used to profile the water column of lakes and it was selected due to its use in large lakes such as Simcoe where profiling is needed to deep depths under adverse weather conditions. The Water PAM is a specialized fluorometer used to assess the variable fluorescence of phytoplankton communities in water and is used to examine phytoplankton physiology and provide estimates of production. The isotope analyzer is a specialized, inexpensive and efficient tool to measure stable isotopes. The spectrophotometer will be used to measure dissolved nutrient concentrations in water.","Oceans and inland waters",Geosciences

"1. The Attentional Blink.  Attentional limitations in vision are revealed the attentional blink (AB): When two visual targets are inserted in a stream of distractors displayed in rapid sequence, accuracy is nearly perfect for the first target (T1) but is dramatically reduced for the second (T2).  Two basic facts about the AB are: (a) the processing of T2 is delayed while the system is busy processing T1, and (b) during the period of delay, T2 is vulnerable to masking by a trailing stimulus. If T2 is not masked, the delay of T2 processing still occurs, but the AB deficit is absent.  Theories of the AB have accounted for (a) but not for (b).  In the planned research, I will examine the proposition that, during the delay, a representation of T2 is stored in a labile memory buffer where it is vulnerable to masking and decay. I plan to use the AB deficit as a tool of convenience to study the characteristics of the labile memory buffer. The ultimate plan is to describe the characteristics of that memory buffer, and to examine its relationship to other short-term memory systems such as iconic memory and working memory.



2. Decomposing the N2pc.  Attentional selection of a target presented among distractors can be indexed with an event-related potential (ERP) component known as the N2pc (an enhancement of the posterior N2 wave at electrode sites contralateral to the target). Our current work has revealed two components of the N2pc: a novel contralateral ERP component that appears to reflect direct suppression of the cortical representation of the distractor (distractor positivity, PD), and a component associated with target processing (target negativity ,NT). We will employ interference techniques (masking, TMS) guided by time-sensitive brain-imaging techniques (EEG, MEG, beamformer) to describe the feed-forward and reentrant processes that lead from the registration of a visual stimulus to its conscious awareness.

"Despite major progresses, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in developed nations.  In order to propose new therapeutic and preventive interventions, there exists a need to understand the foundation of the mechanical and structural changes of cardiovascular organs due to pathology. In particular, overpressure plays a major role in initiating cardiovascular diseases. The present proposal will use a combination of continuum mechanics, computational methods, computer vision and statistical techniques, and material characterization testing to investigate the effect of high pressure on the structure, function and remodeling of the left atrium. The left atrium is becoming the new frontier of heart failure treatment. Despite its clinical relevance (more than 900,000 strokes/year are due to atrial fibrillation in North America and Europe), however, fewer data are available on the mechanics of the atria than are on hand for the ventricles. The characterization of changes of the left atrium due to pressure overload will contribute to the understanding of remodeling due to hypertension. This has been studied extensively for the left ventricle but has not yet been studied in the atrium.

"Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation is a valuable method for the fast design and development of digital controllers for multi-motor power electronic drives. In this method the digital controller is tested by interfacing with a real-time digital simulator that models various components of the plant that includes multiple machines, power electronic conversion apparatus, and various loads. Since the controller will be required to operate, upon successful commissioning, in the real environment, it is important that the real-time simulator models the plant as accurately as possible. This project intends to develop highly accurate models for multi-motor power electronic drives to be used in hardware-in-the-loop simulation and control using state-of-the-art digital hardware.  The main objectives of the project are as follows: (1) To develop detailed device-level real-time models for multi-level power electronic converters. (2) To develop a real-time finite-element based machine model to interface with the power electronic drive. (3) To develop a robust algorithm for real-time parameter estimation of induction machines (4) To implement real-time vector control algorithms in a HIL configuration with a real-time digital simulator. (5) To validate the the HIL simulation using an experimental test setup.



Multi-motor drives are widely used in many demanding industrial applications and processes such as electric vehicles, paper and textile manufacturing, electric traction, and commercial and military ships and aircrafts. Accurate real-time models of  multi-motor drives optimized for HIL application will significantly enhance the rapid prototyping of advanced control algorithms to improve drive performance and increase energy efficiency. Furthermore, such models decrease total development time and cost, while  increasing test coverage and product reliability off-setting some of the inherent risks related to physical prototype testing.

"Electrical power systems are large and complex interconnected systems containing myriad of heterogeneous equipment.  Sophisticated power electronic technologies such as High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) links and Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) are playing a vital role in modern power systems for efficient generation, transmission, distribution and utilization of electrical power. Real-time digital simulators are utilized for the design and testing of power electronic apparatus and associated digital controllers before their commissioning in the host power system. For a rigorous testing and an insight into the impact of the power electronic apparatus and its control strategy, there is a need for extensive modeling of the host power system over a wide range of operating conditions.  Currently available real-time simulators are not able to model the power electronics apparatus in great detail while accommodating a large power system at the same time. 



This research proposal focuses on a hybrid approach for real-time simulation of large-scale power systems with embedded power electronic apparatus. The research program has three main objectives: (1) To develop novel parallel processing algorithms for real-time transient stability simulation of realistic-size power systems, and interfacing them to the detailed electromagnetic or device-level models for power electronic apparatus. (2) To demonstrate the feasibility of such algorithms using hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation. (3) To experimentally validate the real-time implementation using pertinent laboratory test systems.



This research is highly innovative with the potential to generate very accurate and cost-effective solutions, with the ultimate objective of ensuring a secure and reliable electric supply to the end user. Individuals trained in this program will be a valuable asset to the Canadian electric power industry as well as the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry.

"The need for energy has an impact on the nation's politics, economy, environment and sustainable development. It is therefore crucial to have a broad array of technological solutions available to meet the future energy needs of the country. Thermal energy storage (TES) systems are promoted as a potential solution due to their increased energy efficiency, environmental benefits and appropriateness for industrial, commercial and residential settings, amongst others Recently, utilization of TES systems has increased drastically for both heating and cooling applications, and is becoming essential in thermal applications to offset the mismatch between demand and supply and provide less expensive energy solutions. 

      The overall objective of the proposed research program is to investigate the energetic, exergetic, economic, environmental, sustainability and life cycle performance of TES systems. The specific project tasks are: (i) to study energetic performance through energy analysis and develop energetic performance criteria, parameters, labels, such as efficiencies, performance coefficients, energetic renewability ratio, energy loss ratio, etc., (ii) to study exergetic performance through exergy analysis and develop exergetic performance criteria, parameters, labels, such as efficiencies, performance coefficients, exergetic renewability ratio, exergy loss ratio, etc., (iii) to study economic performance through cost accounting and find the most cost effective applications and operating strategies, (iv) to study environmental performance through various environmental impact measures (e.g., global unrest, impact ratio, global impact factor, environmental effectiveness) to address the impact caused on human health and welfare, environment, ecology, etc., (v) to study sustainability performance through various sustainability parameters (i.e., sustainable index) based on the respective criteria defined by indicators, e.g., parameters, which quantitatively determine mutual relation between different options under consideration, and (vi) to assess life cycle performance for all systems, components, processes, and subprocesses, etc.

"Tectonic stress is a fundamental parameter in the Earth sciences, comparable with topography, gravity, heat flow and other data. Stress observations are important for both academic research (e.g. geodynamics, plate tectonics) and applied sciences (e.g. hydrocarbon production, mining and civil engineering). Earthquake parameters are one of the most important and valuable source of information about the tectonic stresses, and especially their focal mechanisms. The purpose of the present program is to define the focal mechanisms and other dynamic parameters of earthquakes in Ontario and western Quebec from 1995 until now, and to obtain a detailed image of the stresses in the earth crust using stress inversion methods at two different scales - regional and local.  The high-resolution 3-D image of the stresses will be correlated with 3-D structural images of the earth crust, based on the seismic velocity inversion. This research is expected to contribute towards an understanding of the nature of the neotectonic processes in eastern Canada and their relationship with mantle processes. It will produce important information for a future seismic hazard re-assessment based on domains with different tectonic regimes. The research will also contribute towards providing information about the local state-of-stress at some critical facilities (Nuclear Waste Disposals, etc.). 

The methods developed for local stress inversion will be implemented for mining design purposes at smaller scale and a methodology for automatic estimation of the spatial and temporal variation of the local stress field in mines will be produced. This methodology can be used by mining authorities all over the worlds for a rapid evaluation of hazards and mitigation measures, as well as for the design of the existing mining excavations. As a result of the program at least 5 highly qualified personnel will receive world-class training in seismology and seismotectonics.

"This proposal is for developing and evaluating new statistical methods needed in cancer clinical trial practice, which will enable: 1) identifying cutoff points in predictive biomarkers or build gene signature classifier for cancer treatment selection; 2) better estimating treatment effect; 3) improved planning and analysis of clinical trials, and 4) study its implication in health economics. These methods will be implemented in the frame work of Cox regression models with change-point(s) problems. 

Oncology Clinical Trials usually evaluate the efficacy of a new treatment based on population average of treatment effect . But patients are different, and most cancer treatments benefit only a minority of patients to whom they are administered, especially for targeted therapies. So it is imperative to develop effective statistical methods that can predict which patients are likely to benefit from which drug. It is hypothesized that the pretreatment gene expression profile of cancer possesses the information about the sensitivity to cancer therapy, and the information can be extracted transcriptional profiling and multigene signature predictors of response can be developed through statistical data analysis and be used for tailoring individualized treatment. The project is seeking to develop methods to determine the cutoff point(s) of a predive biomarker, find pharmacogenomic classifier using gene expression profiles as tools for treatment selection, i.e, to treat patients according to the level of the biomarker or/and the expression levels of the gene signature. Other relevant inference issues in analyzing cancer clinical trials will also be explored, such as, estimate the primary treatment effect within subgroup; health economic analysis, such as cost-effectiveness analysis.

Research topics will also be used for graduate students and post doctoral fellow training

development of RTE software. For instance, IBM, the global leader in model-driven software development (MDD) tools, is offering a successful RTE software development tool based on MDD.



The goal of the project is to advance the state of the art in the Canadian industry with respect to the ability to develop RTE software using MDD. The results of the research will allow tool vendors to devise more effective RTE software development tools. In turn, the embedded systems industry will benefit from these improved

tools which would allow them to build more complex RTE software with less cost.



Our technical objectives are to develop innovative techniques that make it easier for tool users to build correct RTE models via improved execution and debugging capabilities and to maximize the utility of RTE models via more powerful analysis techniques. The proposal addresses key challenges faced by the industrial partners and the results will ensure the continued competitiveness in the RTE software market. The project will also provide funding for 2 Ph.D. students, 1 Postdoctoral Fellow, 2 M.Sc. students, and 2 undergraduate students.

"The cost of software development is already very significant in many industries. This trend is very likely to continue as many future technologies and products depend  on more complex software to provide additional features in the face of, e.g.,  increased demands for more decentralized control or evidence-based certification. For instance, by 2010 even low-end automobiles may be controlled by more than 100 million lines of code. 



Most engineering disciplines manage to reconcile the complexity of the product with stringent correctness requirements by building and analyzing models. For software development, model-driven development (MDD) has the proven potential to allow us to build tomorrow's software substantially more efficiently and reliably. 



The proposed research will advance the state of the art in MDD. By leveraging existing engineering techniques in novel ways we will enlarge the scope of MDD and increase its rigor. By developing concepts and techniques for the more effective testing and analysis of models we will allow users of MDD to increase the utility of their models. 



The research will provide training for 3 Ph.D. students, 3 M.Sc. students, and 2 undergraduate students. Students will acquire state-of-the-art software development skills using the most recent techniques and tools. Since the research will involve the application of engineering knowledge to software development, participating students will acquire a unique ""bicultural"" education. Interaction with industry will give students a chance to influence future products and to gain valuable industrial experience.

"Older adults often fall. Falls have an effect on seniors' quality of life and them being able to live alone. Falls cause 85% of all injuries that send Canadian seniors to the hospital and 90% of all hip fractures; and, result in 40% of nursing home placements. The purpose of this research is to build a ""near-falls and falls detection system."" The system is worn by an older adult and collects data about the person. Doctors and others can then use the data to assess a near fall (an almost fall) or fall. Being able to correctly detect near falls is important for a few reasons: (1) many almost falls over time raises an older adult's fall risk; (2) knowing what happens when a senior almost falls gives doctors and others key data to prevent a future serious fall; and, (3) ways of assessing an almost fall and fall rely on the person being able to recall the event. Canadians are getting older. The research results will play a role in the care of older adults in the areas of preventing and treating falls, improving quality of life, and decreasing injuries and death, and may result in less hospital visits, fewer disabled seniors, and health care cost savings.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Biomedical Technologies"
"The current trend toward a new class of products called convergent system integrates many functions (voice, video and data) and many different technologies (digital, RF, analog and optical) into one. This trend can be visualized with four approaches: system-on-chip (SOC), multichip module (MCM), system-in-package (SIP) and system-on-package (SOP). The architecture in 3-D integrated circuits provides a convergent system, the many-in-one package, with good performance and less power. There must be interconnections between the dies or chips within the system for communication purposes. Wireless interconnection has been proven outperforming the wire communication in the ICs since it provides high speed with more compact and lower cost for multi-function IC's.

     This proposal develops wireless communication links for in-chip (i.e., in one package) using the emerging technology in wireless communications: the ultra wideband (UWB). This type of communication link provides numerous benefits for data transmission between different portions of the chip or between the dies in the 3D structure of a package. The wireless communications insides the package replacing wires not only reduces silicon area, power consumption and dissipating heat but also minimizes crosstalk and signal propagation delay. Freedom from connecting wire makes 3D packaging much simpler as the precision and robustness of the connecting wires are eliminated. 

     Results from this project change the design approach for the new trend of system design. The use of this new technology reduces chip area, power consumption, cost, and difficulty in IC packaging. A spin-off benefit from this proposal is the UWB technology can be used for chip-to-chip communications in a printed circuit board or in a 3D board-to-board communications.

"Genetic diversity differentiates individuals within a population. It has fundamental importance in allowing a species to survive to changes in environmental conditions. This is applicable to a virus trying to escape an immune response, to any species under the threat of a pathogen, to bacterial populations facing starvation or antibiotics, or even to cancer cells within a tumor competing for limited nutrients, to name just a few. Genetic diversity normally accumulates slowly over the years from uncorrected mistakes at replicating the cell's genetic material. However, some species have acquired mechanisms to boost the rate with which these changes occur by having ways of actively producing and tolerating mutations. Since high mutation rates can also be detrimental (cause death or tumors) these mechanisms are not always active but usually induced by stress or infection.

One way of creating genetic diversity that has been recently identified is by enzymes that act as mutators by directly changing the chemical structure the genetic material, thereby changing the message encoded. We study the evolution of this unique type of enzymes. Our hypothesis is that these enzymes evolved stepwise from metabolic enzymes that can transform free bases by acquiring first the ability to bind and then to attack nucleic acids. We aim to understand how these enzymes acquired this useful but dangerous activity as well as the mechanisms and circumstances by which they contribute to genetic diversity in different species. We will do so by studying related enzymes from evolutionary ancient species, like unicellular protozoans, and comparing them to those from more recent species such as worms or vertebrates. We expect to understand the molecular and structural bases of DNA editing, the selective pressures that maintained this dangerous enzymes during evolution and the biological roles they came to fulfill.

"The occurrence of type 2 diabetes is elevated in older adults and is accompanied by several co-morbidities.  Type 2 diabetes is the impairment of glucose use by muscle tissue. Because insulin is central in the passage of glucose into muscle cell and muscle tissue is a big utiliser of glucose, it is thought that a larger muscle mass is beneficial to the action of insulin.  Nevertheless, several research results suggest that other muscle characteristics need to be regarded.  Determining those muscle characteristics that are important in the action of insulin would help direct our research towards pertinent and efficient interventions to improve the action of insulin and prevent type 2 diabetes.   Overall, our research will help decrease the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in older adults and associated health problems.","Medical and health sciences","Integrative Animal Biology"

"Mustard is a major Canadian food crop. It grows in dry areas unsuitable for other cash crops. The Canadian

mustard growers initiated the ""Mustard 21"" program to increase the revenues from mustard from $ 70 million

to $ 570 million by 2021. Traditional food uses for mustard are saturated, but there is a huge potential for using

the protein for human food, while recovering the oil for industrial uses. Biodiesel is such industrial use.

Mustard oil is high in erucic acid, which makes it an excellent lubricant in high temperature applications. To

capture the edible and industrial components an integrated processing system is proposed. Three technologies

will be integrated. Enzyme assisted aqueous extraction will be used to recover a protein solution, an edible

residue, which is suitable for food applications, and a protein stabilized water/oil emulsion.

Prof. Diosady et al. have patented technology for the purification and recovery of high quality (and value)

protein isolates from alkaline aqueous extracts of mustard and canola seed, while Prof. Boocock has patented

and commercialized biodiesel technology based on the dissolution of both the polar and non-polar components

of the trans-esterification reaction. We believe that a combination of these technologies will allow us to break

the emulsion formed during aqueous extraction and release the oil for transformation to biodiesel without

further co-solvent.

We will develop an effective ""biorefinery"" for mustard seed that recovers the high valued food and

nutraceutical ingredients without contact with organic solvents, and will recover the oil as a superiour quality

biodiesel that may command a significant premium over conventional soy or canola-based biodiesel.

We will work with the support two innovative Canadian firms: Hermann Laue Spice Company in the protein

area and Biox Corporation in the biodiesel area.","Alternative energy resources","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Energy"
"It is clear that a healthy diet can significantly reduce the chances of developing devastating chronic or fatal diseases, including cancers,cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoprosis and neurodegenerative diseases. The new Canada Food Guide recommends a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables. The diet of most Canadians falls short of this high standard, and at least a third of the world's population, living in developing countries have no realistic hope to obtain such a diet. While Canada is a rich country, due to its geography and climate, itis very difficult, and expensive to provide the recommended fresh foods. Food fortification promises a way to provide the critical, active nutritive ingredients present in fresh fruits and vegetables. To produce affordable functional food products containing active micronutrients and nutraceuticals,technology is needed for protecting these reactive compounds through manufacturing, distribution, retail and in-house food preparation, followed by controlled release at the desired site in the digestive system, and ensuring their efficient absorption into the body.We propose to develop integrated nutrient delivery technology for the protection, tergetted delivery, controlled release and enhanced absorption of active micronutrients and nutraceuticals through food systems.We propose to develop microemulsion based delivery systems for hydrophobic and hydrophilic active ingredients. We will immobilize the micronemulsions in glassy polymer coating, protecting the active ingredient, until released in a selected area of the digestive system. In this program we will develop microemulsion systems specifically for hydrophobic and hydrophilic active ingredients separately. When successful, we will test the concepts of incorporating one or more active ingredients in each of the microemulsion phases followed by microencapsulation.The products will be tested in typical food carriers. Three doctorate and some 12  undergraduate students will be trained.","Processed food products and beverages","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Food and Bioproducts"
"The sharp rise in demand for liquid fuels, and the subsequent increase in oil prices led to renewed interest in biofuels. Unfortunately competition for biodiesel and bioethanol has resulted in a sharp rise in food prices, and a shortage of some food staples that form the basis of the diet of the poorest people in developing countries. A number of currently unused of uneconomical feedstocks could be processed to make both fuel and food without putting further pressure on existing food supplies. 

     I propose to develop an integrated processing approach for the simultaneous extraction of oil, protein and phenolic components and will test this approach with three different types of feed stocks: 

1.   brassica carinata, a drought tolerant seed native to Ethiopia, that presently is unsuitable for    food use due to harmful components in the oil. While the oil is a promising industrial oil, its use is uneconomical without recovering the value of the food components; 

2.   freshwater krill, which is an underutilized aquatic resource and a nuisance in B.C.; and

3.   algae, which are proposed as carbon sinks for powerplants,  

      The proposed process will consist of enzymatic aqueous extraction of protein directly from the feedstock and recovery of isolated protein as well as water soluble active components in parallel with recovery of the oil directly or as an emulsion. The emulsion will be dissolved in an ampiphilic solvent, which will be used as the solvent for the catalytic transesterification of the oil to fatty acid esters that meet biodiesel standards. The solvent system will be recycled, and the dissolved solids prepared as animal feed.

    The proposed process goes beyond biorefinery schemes in not only fractionating the feed components, but also performing the transesterification reaction as an integral part of the process. If successful the process will provide alternate protein and renewable energy sources of great potential economic value to Canada as well as to developing countries

"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a biologically active phospholipid that has been shown to produce many responses in a variety of cells including proliferation, morphological changes, migration and cell survival or apoptosis. Although LPA has been shown to play a role during neural development, its effect on post-mitotic, adult central neurons remains unknown. The biological effects of LPA are mediated by the G protein-coupled receptors LPA1, LPA2 and LPA3. The robust expression of LPA1 in the mature brain suggests a prominent role of LPA in the maintenance and function of adult neurons. Furthermore, we recently demonstrated that adult retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the neurons responsible for the transmission of visual information from the retina to the brain, express high levels of LPA1 receptor in vivo and in vitro. In this application, I propose to study the biological response of RGCs to LPA in adult mouse retina dissociated cultures. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that LPA modulates the cellular and process morphology of adult RGCs and that these changes may have an effect on neuronal survival. The following aims are proposed:

1) To investigate the effect of LPA on RGC morphology and process outgrowth. 

2) To establish the effect of LPA on RGC survival. 

3) To identify the intracellular signaling pathways activated by LPA that mediate its biological effects. 

In the short term, this study will address a fundamental cell biology question by defining the role of LPA signaling in adult RGCs. The long-term goals of my research program are to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate RGC survival and process extension in an attempt to build a correlation between neuronal morphology and viability. Funding of this program will provide plenty of opportunities for training of highly qualified personnel.

"POlphyry Cu(-Mo-Au) deposits are crustal scale magmatic-hydrothennal systems involving immense volumes of fluid circulation through and altering a crustal rock mass. We propose herein a 3-year collaborative project to examine two separate but related aspects of the crustal-scale porphyry Cu hydrothennal system, each of which derives from a different fluid component. These components are (1) the broad-scale thennally driven far-field alteration outside the magmatic plume within what is known as the propylilk halu and (2) the quartz-sericite-pyrite veins which records the escape ofthe magmatic-hydrothermal fluid from the porphyry Cu deposit. Each feature extends kilometers above and lateral to a porphyry system. 

Since initial broad scale alteration and geochemical studies were completed in the 1960's and 1970's, there has never been a systematic study ofthe subtle variations of the far field alteration and veins and an attempt to place these in a 3-D context using modem analytical teclmiques including short-wave infrared mineral mappin! and the ability to analyze a large selection of elements with detection limits that are less than the average crustal abundances for those elements. Using the Red Chris Cu-Au system and Highland Valley CuoMo system to address the lateral variations and the Yerington CuoMo system to address the vertical changes, we ar undertaking a 3-year project to build a hydrodynamic model for the subtle far-field alteration from which will derive exploration techniques that can be applied in areas oflimited outcrop to understand and distinguish chemical and temperature gradients that will help exploration in terranes with extensive cover, such as western Canada. This proposal seeks specifically to support a graduate student as part of a 181'ger collaborative project. We envision a better understanding ofthe subtle to not-so-subtle interaction between the rising magmatic-hydrothermal plume, the surrounding rocks, and thermally driven fluid circulation in a porphyry environment.

"    )	It is well known that Boreal Shield ecosystems in the Sudbury area are sensitive to environmental pollution related to nearby mining activities and urban development.  To date, environmental studies in the Sudbury area have focused on water quality and ecological modeling, soil contamination and effects on terrestrial biota, in most cases emphasizing industrial pollution and recovery since the 1970's.  A limited number of lake sediment studies using fossil organisms have extended the record of acidification and metal contamination, demonstrating variable lake response and raising questions concerning ecosystem function within and beyond lakes. This  research will combine established methods in paleolimnological and surface process study (e.g. radiocarbon dating, sediment budgeting, geophysical survey etc.) with more novel approaches (e.g. geochemical fingerprinting and microtextural analysis of natural and anthropogenic particles in soils and lake sediments).  In so doing, the work will consider impacts other than acidification, industrial metal contamination and municipal pollution, for example, deforestation,  fires, agriculture, consequent soil erosion, hydrological change, and more recent urban expansion.  As the cumulative effects of environmental pollution begin to abate, the effects of larger scale climate change are beginning to be felt as well, and rates of change are expected to increase.  It is therefore critically important that multidisciplinary research of the type proposed here be carried out as soon as possible, before evidence of past change is lost, so that appropriate adaptation strategies may be developed if necessary.  In conjunction with its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol, the Government of Canada has identified research into climate change scenarios, impacts and adaptation as a national priority.  Given Sudbury's international recognition for environmental restoration work, the proposed research will support Canada's international reputation for environmental management while facilitating the exchange of information, expertise and appropriately trained personnel.","Earth sciences","Environmental Earth Sciences"

"Given a function (in some class and on some domain), it is convenient and useful to approximate it by simpler objects, for example by polynomials (algebraic, trigonometric or spherical).  Many aspects of the relations between how well we approach the function and how smooth that function is will be studied.  



The relations between various measures of smoothness and different levels of a given measure will be investigated.  



As the smoothness of a function and its distance from a simpler class of functions are building blocks in approximation theory, I expect parts of the research will be used by other scientists in approximation theory, allied fields and whoever is interested in quantitative estimates.



In the last few years I worked successfully with several post-doctoral fellows (presently with A.

My papers are clearly of interest to some as they are often cited (Math Sci Net mentions about 300 citations by over 100 authors in the last six years) and they are also often downloaded (e.g. in the Journal of Approximation two of my papers were in the top 10 of downloaded papers for a few months).

"The overall goal of my research programme is to understand the working parts, the cells and molecules, of fish immune systems. Most current immunological knowledge is derived from mammals but because fish and mammals last shared an ancestor 400 million years ago, it is not possible to transfer this knowledge to fish immune systems. We focus on three key features of fish immune systems: mechanisms that tell the immune cells where to go within the body, mechanisms help the immune system identify invaders to the body, and mechanisms which turn the immune system on and off. For the first area of focus we study important immune system molecules the chemokines, chemical attractants for immune cells, and so far we have identified two genes that make these from rainbow trout. We are now investigating when and where these genes are turned on and which cells that they attract. For the second area of focus we have cloned several genes and are now investigating how the proteins they produce interact to identify pathogens. In the third area of focus we are examining how fish kept in cold water turn off their immune system to conserve energy. The knowledge gained from this research will help the aquaculture industry develop vaccines and prevent them losing millions of dollars worth of fish to disease. Since humans have all of the same genes and proteins, but regulate and use them in a different manner, this research will also provide some background information that will help us understand our own resistance to diseases.",Aquaculture,"Integrative Animal Biology"

"The long-term objectives of my laboratory's program in environmental toxicology are: 1) to understand the environmental factors that modify the impacts of toxic chemicals on biota and, 2) to develop methods to assess contaminant impacts on free-living organisms.  An understanding of modifying factors is crucial for the application of laboratory toxicology data to the field, or the application of field data collected at one site to another, during site-specific quantitative environmental risk assessment (QERA) of contaminants to protect the environment.  While looking at the effects of various modifying factors over my career, it has become evident that what we are really looking at is how environmental factors modify the bioavailability of a chemical; how exposure concentration, time and assimilation/depuration kinetics interact to achieve a critical (threshold of toxicity) chemical concentration in the organism.  Models developed using this approach provide a deterministic link between hypothesis formulation and testing in environmental toxicology.  We have used this approach to characterize the kinetics of mercury in Lake Victoria, the toxicity of Cd in sediment to benthic invertebrates in both the laboratory and the field, the toxicity of tributyl tin oxide to aquatic invertebrates in freshwater, and the toxicity of metals in sediments from metal-impacted lakes.  In the future we will examine dietary vs. waterborne toxicity of metals to invertebrates, the ability to predict acute and chronic toxicity of copper to aquatic invertebrates, the toxicity of nanoparticles to aquatic biota and the interactive toxicity of ultraviolet light, products of combustion and metals to fish.  Overall, the work contributes to our basic understanding of the impact of environmental contaminants, and to sound scientifically-based Canadian environmental regulations.

This simple perspective integrates a wide range of theoretical ideas and empirical phenomena. The proposal spans three lines of research: Experiments on choice of action, experiments on the action cueing, and experiments on the control of action. In the first line of research, research participants select from several possible actions, and the nature of their choice is examined as a function of the current context and what has been done in the recent past. In the second line of research, cues are provided that potentially facilitate the retrieval of prior episodes, and the effect on response time is measured. And in the last line of research, the use of retrieval cues to control cognitive processing in different tasks will be studied. The focus in all of these is on the role of memory retrieval of prior episodes and how the nature of the memory retrieval cue affects that process.","Social sciences","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences"

"This research program will examine the special relationship between our sense of smell and our emotions. Odours can elicit mood shifts and evoke emotionally loaded memories. The main goal of this program is to examine several factors that influence our judgments about whether or not we like certain smells and how these emotive judgments are represented in our brains. In the first series of studies, odour mixtures made of varying proportions of a pleasant and an unpleasant smell will be used to determine whether our physiological responses (such as skin conductance) to odours correlate with their pleasantness and also what brain structures respond to increasing odour pleasantness. In the second series, I intend to further explore previous findings that we judge and respond to odours based not only on their physical characteristics but also on our beliefs about their source. For example, our perception of and physiological response to an odour will be very different depending on whether we believe it emanates from carrot juice or mouldy vegetables. Brain correlates of this phenomenon will be explored using electrophysiological and blood flow measures of brain activity. Finally, we know that when we become familiar with certain odours, our reaction to them diminishes: pleasant odours become less pleasant and unpleasant odours become less unpleasant. In the last series of experiments, several questions related to this phenomenon will be explored: Is this effect stronger in food than non-food odours? Is the effect long-lasting? Does it occur in the nose or in the brain? What brain structures are associated with this shift in judgment?

"The primary goal of this research is to develop methods for the synthesis of biologically active compounds related to natural products that possess antibacterial and anticancer properties.  



One class of natural products of interest in this group is the anticancer antibiotics called the kinamcyins.  This research group has played a major role in elucidating the unusual chemical structure of these compounds which incorporate a rare diazo group with surprising chemical and biochemical properties.  Biological and biochemical testing suggests that these compound likely have a novel mode-of-action which suggests that they might offer advantages in treating cancers that are resistant  anticancer agents that are currently available for clinical use.



This research proposal also outlines several new chemical strategies for constructing nitrogen containng cyclic heterocyclic compounds such as analogues of antitumour antibiotic FR900482.



Additionally, this project will explore novel chemical transformations recently uncovered in his group for constructing complex carbocyclic systems, some of which are found incorporated in the carbon skeleta of complex bioactive natural products.



Based on the history of trainees who have been trained in this area in this research group in the past, it is expected that these projects will provide a solid training ground for careers in a variety of industries dependent on skills in organic synthesis and an appreciation of the biological significance of organic molecules, such as in the pharmaceutical industry.

Nanomaterials are currently considered a new frontier as the control of solid dimensions at nanometric level brings about entirely new surface properties. Catalytic and electrocatalysis are essentially dependent on surface chemical properties, so that the potential applications of nanomaterials in these two fields look extremely promising.

The project proposes to study new preparation technique for two series of materials (nanoparticles and mesostructured molecular sieves). In each case the structural and surface properties of the produced materials will be correlated with the parameters of the synthesis procedure. Then the appropriate solids will be tested for activity in a variety of catalytic and electro-catalytic processes.

"Dans notre laboratoire, les projets sont r�partis en trois sous domaines distincts correspondants � trois cat�gories de nanomat�riaux: mat�riaux hybrides m�soporeux bifonctionnels, nanoz�olithes et nanocomposites � base de nanoparticules. Ces mat�riaux pourront �tre utilis�s dans diff�rents secteurs industriels (par exemple le raffinage du p�trole) et la protection de l'environnement (par exemple, les pots catalytiques des automobiles ou encore les piles � combustibles). Contrairement � ceux que nous d�veloppons, les catalyseurs homog�nes employ�s dans l'industrie sont souvent corrosifs et nuisibles pour l'environnement. 

Chaque projet a pour but de pr�parer un nouveau type de mat�riau et de contribuer au d�veloppement de  nouveaux proc�d�s catalytiques performants.

Dans le premier projet,  les performances catalytiques de mat�riaux m�sostructur�s hybrides seront �valu�es � l'aide la r�action d'alkylation entre une ol�fine et une paraffine branch�e. Ce type de r�action est notamment utilis� dans le raffinage du p�trole.  

Les deux autres projets sont bas�s sur deux approches originales r�cemment d�velopp�es dans notre laboratoire permettant de produire des nouveaux types de nanoz�olithes et de nanocomposites. L'int�r�t de produire des mat�riaux de taille nanom�trique est l'apparition de nouvelles propri�t�s inexistantes dans le cas des mat�riaux conventionnels. La premi�re approche, relative � la pr�paration de nanoz�olithes avec la surface externe hydrophobe, pourrait �tre appliqu�e � la synth�se de quelques 140 familles de z�olithes connues � ce jour. 

La seconde approche permet de produire des nanocomposites � base de nanoparticules ayant des propri�t�s catalytiques tr�s prometteuses. Un des aspects cruciaux de ce projet consiste � remplacer les catalyseurs � base de m�taux nobles employ�s actuellement par des oxydes mixtes nanocristallins beaucoup moins cher mais plus performants. Les nanocatalyseurs d�velopp�s dans ce projet auront un fort potentiel dans de nombreuses applications dont le r�le dans la protection de l'environnement est incontestable.","Manufacturing processes and products","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng."

"This proposal seeks funding for the purchase of a three stage (4He, 3He, and 3He) absorption refrigerator from Chase Research that will achieve 250 mK base temperatures, allowing the McGill cosmology group to test and develop new technology for mm-wave detection with Transition Edge Sensor Bolometers.



The McGill Cosmology Instrumentation Laboratory, led by Prof. Dobbs, is at the forefront of technology development for the new generation of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments that are reaching the field now. The group's existing cryogenic test facility is in use 100% of the time testing and characterizing detectors and readout components that are being deployed for these experiments, including the South Pole Telescope, APEX-SZ, EBEX, and POLARBEAR. These experiments are already producing forefront cosmology measurements, including the first detection of distant galaxy clusters using a distortion of the CMB called the Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect. The commissioning of the new cryogenic facility that will be enabled by this proposal will allow Dobbs' group to maintain its leadership in the development of new technology by enabling the testing and design of new instrumentation in parallel with the characterization of the devices that are being fielded now. The equipment will be used extensively for the training of highly qualified personnel, as the primary users of will continue to be graduate students and postdocs.

"Precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background polarization may allow cosmologists to detect the signature of inflationary gravity waves, providing an image of the universe when it was a tiny fraction of a second old. A new generation of instruments, detectors, and electronic readout systems are being developed to perform these measurements. Though ground based instruments are being commissioned now, the definitive measurements will likely take place from space platform instruments.

The electronics for reading out focal planes consisting of kilo-pixel arrays of cryogenic bolometric sensors has been a key technological challenge for this type of instrument. Canadians have demonstrated an international leadership role in this technology development. Dobbs, the PI of this proposal, has co-developed a technique with collaborators at Berkeley that uses Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices for first stage amplification and multiplexing the detector signals in the frequency domain. Dobbs' group at McGill University recently developed a prototype low power digital version of the room temperature backend electronics for use on a mm-wavelength polarization sensitive telescope, called EBEX, that NASA will fly to the top of the atmosphere aboard a high altitude balloon platform. This system is designed to read out many cryogenic detectors on a single set of wires. This greatly reduces the heat load on cryogenic stage, complexity of the system, and overall cost.

This proposal seeks funding to further develop the system for satellite platforms while creating a partnership between academia (McGill University), industry (COM DEV), and the Canadian Space Agency. The target application for this technology is space platform instruments for mm-wavelength cosmology observations. It is also directly relevant for several applications including magnetic medical imaging, nuclear forensics, x-ray micro-calorimetry, and earth observation from space.

"In a world of rapid growth of commercial wireless services, accommodating the explosive demand for spectrum access, efficiency and reliability becomes increasingly technically challenging. Furthermore, implementation of advanced information services for military applications in a crowded electromagnetic spectrum is a challenging task for communication engineers. A solution is provided by flexible cognitive and intelligent radios, capable of sensing and adapting to the environment. With software defined radio (SDR) products today, cognitive and intelligent radio is just the next step, and not a leap, in radio development.



The objective of this research program is to develop a conceptual framework and a set of efficient algorithms for cognitive and intelligent radio systems, with both commercial and military applications. Dynamic spectrum sensing, opportunity sharing, radio access with high spectral efficiency, and blind signal recognition, which includes blind separation of multiple received signals, blind parameter estimation and equalization, and blind modulation classification, are topics proposed to be investigated. 



This work is crucial to cope with the scarce electromagnetic spectrum resource in commercial and military radio communications, and vital for decision involving electronic warfare in military operations. Results of this research will facilitate the understanding of methodologies and techniques which can be used to solve challenging open research problems pertaining to the cognitive and intelligent radio systems. The suite of algorithms devised in this research will serve as an engine for SDR to be used in such systems. 

The proposed research falls in the area of intelligent systems technologies for advanced telecommunications and security sectors, which, according to the federal Department of Industry, represents a priority direction of R&D investment in Canada.

"The controlled manipulation and organization of colloidal particles (i.e., particles with size smaller than 1 micron stably suspended in a fluid) into one-, and multi-dimensional ordered structures represents the first step towards the fabrication of a large number of miniaturized products of great technological importance. Structural attributes such as long-range order, high packing density, high surface-to-volume ratio, and reproducible shape and dimensions are highly desirable in applications ranging from miniaturized sensors and actuators, to nanoreactors, catalysts, photonic crystals, and high-density magnetic recording media. However, the organization of colloidal particles, particularly nanoparticles (size<100 nm), into ordered structures devoid of defects and extending over length scales much larger than the particle size remains a big challenge.

The goal of the proposed research is to develop a methodology that utilizes externally applied non-uniform electric fields for achieving template- and contact-free organization of nanoparticles into well defined, multi-dimensional ordered structures with prescribed length scale and composition. This goal will be accomplished through a systematic research approach, which is characterized by a rational transition from 2D to 3D structures and from micro- to nanoparticles. Experiments and computational work will be combined in order to gain fundamental understanding of the effect of numerous, frequently opposing, forces that govern the transport, positioning, or assembly of (nano)particles suspended in a liquid medium inside a non-uniform electric fields. 

The proposed project will train 5 highly qualified personnel (2 Ph.D., 2 M.Sc., and 1 PDF) for professional careers in the areas of Nanoscale Engineering and Colloid Science. The proposed research will lead to significant advances in the field of nanotechnology through: (a) the fabrication of nanostructures having hierarchical order and (b) the development of novel process design tools for the efficient use of electric fields in large-scale manufacturing.

"The last decade has seen a sea change in the use of computational methods in mathematics. This is true both for applied mathematics, where computation has become an essential modeling tool in life sciences, physics, and engineering, as well as for pure mathematics, where computation has become increasingly important for studying partial differential equations or complex geometric and abstract objects. The computational facilities in the Math Department at UBC have not been updated in line with these developments, and are now lacking far behind the minimum standards for a department of this size and national importance. Therefore, we propose to both upgrade our servers used for centralized computational tasks such as large algorithms and visualization, as well as acquire individual workstations for smaller computational tasks. Our graduate students will be the main beneficiaries of this upgrade. Computational skills are highly desirable in today's job market, and the equipment requested in this application would support this kind of training, which requires more computational resources than the department currently has.","Mathematical sciences","Mathematics and Statistics"
"The origin of diversity is the mystery of mysteries according to Darwin. Millions of species exist today, but the detailed mechanisms generating this diversity are still unclear. The traditional model of speciation is based on geographical isolation: if subpopulations of an ancestral lineage become geographically subdivided (e.g. through fragmentation due to climatic changes), they embark on different evolutionary trajectories, and hence diversify. Here the initial process of splitting the gene pool is not adaptive. In contrast, in the process of adaptive speciation, the splitting of the gene pool is itself an adaptation. The past decade has seen growing interest in such adaptive diversification, because both empirical and theoretical studies have documented its feasibility. The paradigmatic theory of evolutionary branching has popularized the notion that diversification can be driven by ecological interactions such as competition for resources. Using the bacterium E. coli, I have developed a microbial model system to test the theory of adaptive diversification due to evolutionary branching. E. coli offers many advantages, including the possibility of evolving it for thousands of generations and creating a fossil record by freezing intermediate stages. Our evolving E. coli populations have undergone diversification due to competition for carbon resources. Based on molecular, physiological and ecological experiments, my research aims at fully analyzing all aspects of the process of adaptive diversification in this model system, documenting the evolutionary changes prior, during and after the diversification event. We are also studying the origins of diversity in a different microbial system, in which diversification occurs in the context of the general problem of cooperation, leading to coexistence of cooperators and cheaters in the production of a beneficial substance. Another main focus of our research is the mathematical modeling of our experimental model systems based on ""reaction kinetics"" of individuals, describing individual growth, reproduction and survival using the knowledge gained from our experiments. Finally, we plan to investigate how predation affects diversification in both the experimental and the mathematical model systems.

"My main research interest is the development, analysis, implementation, and application of numerical methods for analyzing the solution behavior of nonlinear equations. I have worked on dynamical systems, especially those modeled by ordinary differential equations, and I am also interested in nonlinear elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations.



My work is motivated by the fascinating changes of behavior exhibited by solutions to nonlinear equations as parameters are varied: There is tremendous satisfaction in devising new numerical algorithms that help increase our understanding of these phenomena. Recent applications range from a classification of elemental periodic orbits of the Circular Restricted 3-Body Problem, which is relevant to space mission design, to the computation of invariant manifolds, which explains an apparent discontinuous response in a cardiac pacemaker cell model.



I try to make the numerical methods available for use in widely varying research areas. A notable success has been the development of the research software AUTO, which continues to evolve in cooperation with researchers in a world-wide network.



I will further develop high-order accurate, adaptive discretizations of elliptic PDEs, resulting in software to track solutions, and determine their bifurcations, even in near-singular applications. Another focus is continuation techniques for periodic orbits (including infinite period orbits) and invariant manifolds in dissipative as well as conservative systems. Important applications will be studied.

"In cold regions, there are two periods of significant challenge with respect to the operation of water resources infrastructure: freeze-up and breakup.  The focus of the current proposal is on freeze-up.  The motivation for this focus arises from the significant impact, both social and financial, that freeze-up processes can have on water resources infrastructure in cold regions.  In particular, as a body of water begins to freeze-up active frazil ice particles form.  These ice particles can attach to infrastructure and plug a water supply intake or shut down a hydroelectric plant.  They can also attach to the river bed or an ice cover and cause flooding.  While our understanding of frazil ice processes is evolving, very few researchers pursue frazil ice research, so progress is slow, and consequently many questions remain.



This proposal will address three interrelated objectives.

1. Frazil Ice Formation and Evolution

2. Frazil Ice Formations: Anchor & Skim Ice

3. Numerical Modeling of Frazil & River Ice Processes



The short to medium term objectives of this proposal are to improve our understanding of active frazil ice and skim ice through a further laboratory experiments.  The long term objective is to improve the numerical modeling of these processes in order to more effectively manage and operate Canada's water resources infrastructure in cold regions.

"Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are expressed in cells throughout the animal kingdom. PTPs are responsible for removing phosphate groups from the amino acid tyrosine in proteins. They are important to reverse the addition of phosphate groups to proteins as a regulatory mechanism in the cell. The contribution of PTPs to the development and function of the mammalian nervous system are virtually unknown. The purpose of this research grant is to study the role of PTPs during the early development of the nervous system. We will study aspects of new cell formation from stem cells in the brains of mice that have been genetically engineered to produce inactive PTP. Experiments will be completed to determine how PTP affects the division of cells and the death of cells during brain development. These experiments are important because the information will inform us of the biological pathways that control the production of new cells in the brain. The results of this grant have broader implications for progress toward therapies that stimulate new growth in the brain affected by disease or injury.

considerable new opportunities for tracking humans and supporting Location-Based Services (LBS). These

technologies can be used to wirelessly transmit a person's location to a central server for storage and display.

Research has shown that the resulting data can provide a highly accurate trace of personal or vehicular

movements over a day or longer. Over the past five years the applicant has pioneered development of a

patent-pending system for processing this data to automatically detect human activities and a wide range of

their attributes. This includes detection of stationary activities by start/end time and location (geo-coordinates

and even building names), movements, trips and physical activity (walking, running, biking, driving), and

environmental attributes (indoors, outdoors, natural environments, highways, etc.). The proposed project

involves six key technical enhancements to this system in support commercialization opportunities in three key

sectors: Healthcare and elderly activity living facilities, Weight-loss and wellbeing, and location-based services

(LBS). Moving to the wider commercial market requires enhancement in the core activity detection algorithm,

reduction of the power consumption associated with all-day GPS tracking, and improved data security and

privacy protection measures. This proposal outlines a clear solution to this, utilizing accelerometer devices

embedded in the latest Smartphones, and industry leading data security and privacy best-practices. These

developments will be integrated into existing BlackBerry and browser-based display interfaces, forming

prototype products to be pilot tested in an elderly care facility and weight-loss clinic. The Wilfrid Laurier

"The theme of our research is the investigation of the formulations that are the basis of mechanics and approximate solutions by the finite element method. We look into the theoretical foundations of mechanics, the modeling of mathematically difficult problems, variations and extension of finite element techniques. This gives understanding of the mechanics that can then be applied to the needs of industry. With this goal in mind, we are proposing the study of two specific problems.

Tube bundles are found in many critical components such as heat exchangers, condensers, and nuclear steam generators.  Traditionally, these tubes wear made robustly and the equipment had rather modest performance demands, and flow-induced vibration problems were rare. However, designs with higher performance and efficiencies resulted in tubes being more flexible and were subjected to higher flow rates. Thus, flow-induced vibration problems became commonplace and their study became an important area of research. Our goal is to provide the analytical capacity to help in designing new generation heat exchangers and to assess operating nuclear steam generators.

The other problem deals with the vibration of Satellite's antennas. The design requirements of these antennas are driving the satellite size to dimensions that can not be launched into space using current technology. This problem has dictated a revolutionary change in current satellite design. Instead of using large rigid antennas, new satellites may have inflatable ones. Inflatable satellites possess many advantageous properties such as ultra-lightweight, small stowage volume, high strength-to-mass ratio and low overall space program cost.  Typically, space structures have vibration problems due to low structural stiffness and the lack of air damping in the vacuum of space. Our goal is identify these vibrations and techniques to control them.

"Two-phase flows and specifically sprays have been acknowledged as an important phenomenon integral to many technological and natural systems. Among them are fuel sprays (in engines, burners, and boilers), agricultural sprays, inhaled drug delivery systems, thermal spray coating, etc. One of the most effective instruments available for characterizing the droplet velocity distribution in such systems is a Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). All the three velocity components can be measured and recorded using a Stereo PIV where stereoscopic imaging of particles provides global measurement of three orthogonal velocity components. Two cameras are positioned to view the light sheet obliquely, and the captured particle image displacements contain the influence of all three velocity components. Data reduction techniques then identify the true image displacements and extract the instantaneous 3D velocity vectors for the whole area. 



The application of the proposed equipment is for the research on the complex three-dimensional phenomenon of dense suspension of nanoparticles in high speed flows, fuel spray flow in elliptical nozzles, and atomization of bio-diesel fuels. By measuring the particle velocity distributions, we will develop correlations relating these parameters to the spray nozzle design, the inlet flow conditions as well as the powder loading. Such correlations will not only be used by industry, but will allow us to validate our numerical results and better understand the relationship between various governing parameters and the spray characteristics. The results of this study will facilitate manufacturing of key aerospace, automotive, clean energy, and biomedical components, all of which are important to the Canadian economy.

With vast amounts of biological sequence data now available for DNA, RNA and proteins, the need for fast computational tools is crucial.  There is a substantial research drive to develop new tools which aid in prediction of the function of molecules and construction of evolutionary relationships and histories, for example.



Many of the projects to develop new computational tools for bioinformatics problems are developed with the sole vision of improving the state of the art of biological software. However, many innovations have shown that tools applicable to areas including programming language design, natural language processing and natural language translation are applicable to bioinformatics as well.



This program of research will examine novel solutions to problems in bioinformatics by using existing tools from computer science. Using the theory of formal languages, where sequences of symbols are viewed as words in an abstract language, we will investigate problems from bioinformatics, including the prediction of RNA structure and the modelling of the rearrangement of DNA in single-celled organisms called ciliates.  By reusing existing tools in computer science for biological research purposes, this research program will help view new and established areas in bioinformatics as asking questions about similar problems and having similar solutions.

"Over the past funding period we have made significant progress in several areas related to heterogeneous atmospheric chemistry of aqueous, ice and ""urban grime"" surfaces. We have developed fluorescent probes for determining pH at interfaces and used these to track reactions there; we have demonstrated the ice-surface sensitivity of glancing-angle Raman probes and started to use these to interrogate the quasi-liquid layer; we have quantified the influence of various monolayer organic coatings on ozonation reactions at the air-water interface; we have started to explore and quantify photochemical and especially, photosensitized reactions occurring at interfaces. In many, if not most of these endeavours, we have been the first group to report the technique or its use in atmospheric chemistry. 

During the next funding period we intend to advance these early results beyond the proof-of-principle stage, and provide quantitative kinetic and photochemical parameters for use in atmospheric models. We will couple our surface spectroscopic probes with gas phase product analysis, via mass spectrometry and/or optical spectroscopy in optimized absorption cells, to make quantitative measurements of, for example, photochemically driven nitrogen oxide release from ice and ""urban grime"" surfaces and of the photochemical and oxidative halogen release from liquid and frozen seawater surfaces.

Surrounding the central theme of resource utilization efficiency, new challenges are arising for wireless network and system operation to be control efficient, link adaptive, and nodes collaborative. 



In response to these challenges, this proposed research program aims at developing the enabling technologies and methodologies to maximize resource utilization efficiency per node and across the network for improved wireless communications and heterogeneous networking. This proposed research will discover the fundamental limitations and trade-offs, as well as develop effective schemes, for link adaptation under feedback exploration, energy-constrained signal processing through distributed and collaborative schemes, and cognitive scheduling policies in resource-limited networks, such as wireless mesh networks and sensor networks. This research will be vital to the future advance of wireless communication technologies that overcome resource limitations and foster the widespread use of infrastructure-less networking in areas of public safety, education, and sensing, across Canada and around the world. In addition, the proposed research will contribute to the training of highly qualified personnel by providing excellent opportunities for students to conduct their advanced study under this program.

"Research in organic chemistry is a fundamental and central endeavor that impacts the many fields of science which require the design and synthesis of molecules.  The advent of powerful synthetic methods will dramatically enhance our capability to discover life-saving therapeutics, invent materials with useful and unusual properties, as well as investigate biology at the molecular level.  In the chemistry department at the University of Toronto, the Dong Research Group is engaged in developing innovative strategies to address modern challenges in organic synthesis.  Our main approach involves harnessing the unique reactivity of transition metal-complexes to transform readily available materials into useful organic products.   Some of our long-term goals include finding new ways to functionalize carbon-hydrogen bonds, used carbon-dioxide as a raw material, and construct nitrogen-containing heterocycles.  Importantly, we plan to produce methods which are more selective, more efficient, and environmentally friendly compared to the state-of-the-art.  Aside from the practical significance, our studies are expected to result in fundamentally interesting and novel chemical reactivity.  Ultimately, we will engage in understanding the mechanism of action for these transforms, as well as applying them to make molecules of interest to natural product synthesis, materials science, and chemical biology.  The graduate students and postdoctoral research fellows in our group will be trained in the art of organic synthesis and acquire the skills needed to be tomorrow's innovators in academia and the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industry.

"This research proposal investigates enabling ultra-wideband (UWB) technologies for low rate wireless personal area networks (WPAN). Recently, UWB has been proposed in the IEEE 802.15.4a Working Group as a physical layer candidate for low rate, short range wireless networks.  In the low rate application domain, UWB can easily achieve a transmission speed much higher than that of Bluetooth due to its large bandwidth. The primary features of UWB include low cost, long battery life, multipath immunity and the ability to have communications and simultaneous precision ranging capabilities. Overlaying with the frequency bands of existing radio systems, UWB allows more efficient use of the scarce spectrum resource. The intended applications include smart home and personalized services, consumer electronics, family communications/supervision of children, industrial and building automation, tracking and logistics, asset tagging and management, search and rescue, security, medical applications, and military applications, etc. 



This proposal focuses on key design issues for UWB low rate systems, such as modulation and channel coding, synchronization, ranging and location, co-existence with current wireless systems, multiple access and cross-layer design. The Principal Investigator has recently proposed a novel transmitted reference pulse cluster technique for low rate communications. It has many advantages over existing methods and will be further developed into a complete system in this proposal.   Moreover, an experimental UWB transceiver testbed will be built to validate the theoretical system design in realistic indoor residential and office environments. The anticipated outcome of the research will have considerable impact on the low rate UWB device design and will accelerate commercial development of these UWB devices.

"Telecommunication service providers are racing with time to offer a complete package of services termed triple play that bundles telephony, the Internet and television (TV).  Internet Protocol TV (IPTV) is the key new service that differentiates the current voice and data domination.  The fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network is one of the most promising last mile broadband access techniques that provide sufficient bandwidth to deliver triple play services.  To allow consumers enjoy broadband personalized IPTV services anywhere and anytime without rewiring their houses, this proposal aims at integrating innovatively the FTTH technology for last-mile access networks with the high data rate ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for wireless home networks.  The integrated FTTH/UWB networks offer great flexibility to end users to access the network content. 



In the proposed research, we will design an interface between FTTH optical network termination and UWB access nodes, propose network planning and topology control guidelines, develop efficient resource management schemes, and enhance network protocols and algorithms for UWB-based broadband home networks, based on the ultra-wideband propagation channel measurement and physical layer UWB transceiver implementation.  The study will be conducted through theoretical design and analysis, simulation, experiments and hardware implementation. Multiple transmission mediums in addition to wireless, such as coax cables and power lines, will be measured and analyzed as candidates for in-home distribution. The outcome of the research will help the service providers to better understand the potential of UWB home networks for IPTV services, more infrastructure options to deliver better triple play services to customers, and new prototype designs of the equipment to be deployed at customers' premise. This research will benefit the Canadian telecommunications industry in terms of technology advancement and consumers with new communication and multimedia experience.

"Root nodules of legumes have intracellular bacteria that can fix nitrogen gas into a form of nitrogen that the plant can use. Hydrogen gas is a byproduct of the nitrogen reaction, claiming about 33% of the energy that flows to the enzyme. Legume nodules produce a large quantity of hydrogen gas, and release this into soils. For example, in Canadian alfalfa crop alone, we have estimated that there may be as much as 2.4 thousand million liters of hydrogen gas released to Canadian agricultural soils every year. This hydrogen gas production can use up to 6% of the net gain of photosynthetically derived energy of the entire plant. We do not understand why evolutionary processes, plant breeding of agricultural crops, or selection of optimal nitrogen fixing bacteria has not reduced this energy loss in all legumes. Legumes are ideal crops to use in rotation with other crops (especially cereal crops), resulting in a significant increase in the growth and yield of the subsequent crop. Only about 25% of the increase in the growth of the non-legume crop can be attributed to improved nitrogen nutrition. The remaining 75% of the effect have eluded explanation. We are proposing that the hydrogen released by nodules stimulates and support growth of certain soil hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria. These bacteria in return promote plant growth. The purposes of this study are to 1) analyze the soil bacterial community structure changes in  these soil communities by T-RFLP, and characterize the ""unculturable"" nodule/H2-enhanced bacterial populations by screen PCR library according to the T-RFLP results; 2) culture hydrogen oxidizing bacteria from hydrogen-treated soil and the rhizosphere of HUP- nodules; 3) assay these microbes (and previously isolated microbes) for a multitude of growth-promoting traits under controlled greenhouse conditions, and finally 4) inoculate cereal crop seeds with promising bacterial strains, and assay for beneficial effects under field conditions. The long-term goal of my research is to understand the relationship between the plant roots and soil microorganisms, especially the ones promoting the non-legume crop plants, to provide the practical protocols or inoculants for agriculture.","Plant production and plant primary products","Plant Biology & Food Science"

"My research examines how ions such as sodium, chloride and potassium are transported across cells of organs that are responsible for maintaining appropriate ion levels in the blood. This is a fundamentally important process for all living animals because blood ion levels affect the function of the nervous system, the heart, and most other organs. I am focusing on how ion transport occurs in anal papillae of mosquito and midge fly larvae, and how these processes can be regulated via the nervous system when larvae are subjected to a changing environment (from freshwater to salt-water and vice versa). This routinely happens in the natural habitats of mosquitoes through heavy rainfall and evaporation. Anal papillae are sac like organs that project out from the rear end of the animal. These anal papillae help mosquito larvae to survive under freshwater conditions by taking ions from the water and transporting them into the haemolymph (insect blood). Many mosquito species are capable of surviving in salt-water and the role of the anal papillae in these mosquitoes is not well understood. Therefore I am studying 2 closely related mosquitoes, one of which lives in freshwater and the other in salt-water. In addition, I am examining the midge fly larvae because their anal papillae receive direct inputs from the nervous system. Through these studies I will train students in physiological techniques that are applied in basic, medical and pharmaceutical research in both academic and private sector settings. My research will contribute to the understanding of ion transport mechanisms of transporting tissues and their regulation by the nervous system, fundamentally important processes for all animals. In addition my research can lead to the development of new and specific ways of controlling mosquito populations that transmit diseases such as West Nile Virus and Malaria.

The goal of this research is to develop novel and efficient analytical techniques for separating, identifying, and quantifying bacterial lantibiotics. The other objective is to investigate the association of metals with lantibiotics and the potential utilization of these metal-lantibiotic complexes for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Lantibiotics are a diverse group of heavily modified antimicrobial peptides produced by a wide range of bacteria. They constitute a new group of antibiotics that are being found to ward off infectious diseases against which classic antibiotics are ineffective. Lantibiotics have been used in treating skin infections, for combating pathogenic microorganisms in food, and several have also been characterized for their anti-tumour, anti-cancer and anti-viral activity. Analysis of lantibiotics will be essential for optimization of fermentation, product isolation, process control, determining their optimal dosages, and for determining their concentration in body fluids. Furthermore, an optimized separation of lantibiotics will be advantageous in the screening of food products for drug residues. Studies have indicated that upon chelation with metals, biologically-active compounds become more active in slowing or stopping the growth of cancer and in hampering the growth of bacteria. In addition, their therapeutic potential is enhanced on complexation with metals. With growing interest in lantibiotics as alternative therapeutic agents to classic antibiotics, it is important to investigate how the binding of metal to lantibiotics might expand their therapeutic potential, and possible use in the diagnosis and treatment of pathogenic organisms. To gain this understanding, capillary electrophoresis will be used to investigate the binding properties when metals associate with lantibiotics as well as binding of the metal-lantibiotic complex to target bacteria. This analysis will provide a comprehensive understanding of lantibiotic structure, diversity and modes of action, thus providing an invaluable tool to pharmaceutical, medical and agricultural industries.","Medical and health sciences","Anal. & Phys.

"The expansion of agriculture and industry over the past 150 years would not have been possible without the mobilization of essential nutrients like nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) from the atmosphere and the biosphere. The acceleration of these ""biogeochemical"" cycles has led to increased loading of nitrogen and phosphorus to rivers worldwide, threatening coastal ecosystems and endangering human health. For example, the export of nitrogen by rivers like the Mississippi to the ocean leads to the development of large areas of low-oxygen water, like that observed in the Northern Gulf of Mexico, damaging fisheries and altering the basic function of the coastal ecosystem.



My research team is using state-of-the art numerical ecosystem models to analyse the effect of climate change and land use change on the flow of nutrients and sediments through large river systems like the Mississippi (in the U.S.), the Huang He (Yellow River) and the Mackenzie (in Canada) and the consequences for the coastal environment.  We hope to identify the key ecological and chemical processes that control the nutrient loading to waterways, the sensitivity of those processes to predicted future changes in temperature, rainfall and demands for food and fuel, and the types of policies and management that could minimize damage to the environment.

"The aurora is a beautiful manifestation of interesting physical processes that occur in near-Earth space. Due to interest in the aurora (1) as a 6plasma physics phenomenon, (2) as a tool with which to remote sense geospace, and (3) as an integral part of those dynamics, auroral observations have been seen as centrally important to the Canadian space science program for more than four decades. In 2000, researchers at the University of Calgary developed a bold plan to build a vast array of highly sensitive, multi-spectral All-Sky Imagers with overlapping fields of view spanning much of central and northern Canada.  Over the last seven years, this plan has become a reality, and we are now operating almost 50 instruments across Canada with which we image the aurora in fundamentally new ways. This proposal is for funding for carrying out science with the data from this new imaging array. With this research, we will be exploring geospace dynamics as well as plasma physical processes that are important not only on geospace, but also astrophysics. There are practical benefits as well, as we develop new imaging techniques that are being utilized in industry and develop a better understanding of the near-Earth space environment.

"My research program centers on the geometry, topology, and physics of Calabi-Yau manifolds, and is heavily motivated by string dualities. My work has implications for string-theoretic physics, establishes new results within mathematics, and builds bridges between important questions in physics and deep mathematical conjectures. Doctoral students in mathematics and physics have been, and will continue to be, active participants in all of my research projects. These projects lie in four interrelated areas:



(1) Modular forms play a crucial role in describing many string dualities. By explicitly solving the Hodge Conjecture for several key families of K3 surfaces, we have opened the door to a classification of K3 surface fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds, with applications in both geometry and string theory. 

(2) A major component of my research involves topological aspects of the best-known string duality, mirror symmetry. On the one hand, I will study the Integrality and Divisibility Conjectures, which relate the underlying integral variations of Hodge structure and topological K-theory of mirror pairs of Calabi-Yau manifolds. On the other hand, I have recently established a direct connection between physical predictions from local mirror symmetry and the main motivating conjectures in algebraic K-theory. 

(3) My ground-breaking computation of Kaehler-Einstein metrics on toric surfaces, using a numerical implementation of Hamilton's Ricci-flow, has set the stage for applications of similar techniques to geometric and physical questions. Of particular interest is the case of renormalization group flows in string theory. 

(4) Finally, my work on the geometry of supersymmetric compactifications of M-theory has evolved into a long-term collaborative quest to classify all ""off-shell"" supersymmetric theories. Our multi-faceted approach blends representation theoretic, combinatorial, formal algebraic, and cutting-edge computational techniques. Supercomputers are now being used to study supersymmetry.

The University of Alberta Site of the Pacific Institute for Mathematical Sciences (PIMS) proposes to create a Collaborative Research Environment (CoRE) to facilitate research in the mathematical sciences across Western Canada.  In mathematics, active collaboration requires a shared workspace, typically common blackboards in face-to-face meetings.  New electronic whiteboard and collaboration hub technology, developed by SMART Technologies of Calgary, will be purchased and installed in a dedicated space within the Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences at the University of Alberta.  This will make possible effective real-time mathematical collaboration with other PIMS sites.



Establishing the PIMS CoRE at this time is crucial to the continued success of the PIMS-funded International Graduate Training Centre in Mathematical Biology (initially funded from 2007-2012).  It will also be a key new tool to achieve the scientific objectives of faculty, postdoctoral scholars, and graduate students in the PIMS-Alberta Collaborative Research Groups (CRGs), both present and future.

"There is increasing concern to provide ways to support older adults who want to live independently in their homes as they age. Many home care clients are elderly and live alone with only a few visits a week from healthcare providers. As a result, both clients and health providers feel isolated with unique challenges for health service delivery. Home care expenditures in Canada have increased more rapidly than all other areas of the healthcare system, with the exception of drugs. The demography of the Canadian population suggests these costs will escalate significantly over the next two decades. Cost effective solutions are needed to manage these spiraling costs and to address the social challenges of providing care to older adults who want to live

independently in their homes. The purpose of this study is to investigate a user interface design and data fusion strategies for integrating bio-physiological information about home care clients in their daily lives with a decision support system that will provide homecare clinicians with better scheduling capability, assessment of client activity in and out-of-home, and timely access to decision support. Specifically, the project focuses on the integration of non-intrusive approaches, a cellphone-based GPS-supported monitoring system and a web-based software application that equips clinicians with real-time client information on handheld units. A prototype display will be developed following interviews with homecare nurses to map information flow for a

number of patient specific conditions/scenarios. The display will be modified based on feedback from a panel of independent nurses who will select the most effective qualities of the display. A variety of simulation exercises will then be completed in a simulation laboratory to further refine and evaluate the system. At the conclusion of the simulation study, the system will be implemented in 'live' homecare settings for the purpose of determining the feasibility and safety in the field. The study findings will provide valuable information about the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating bio-physiological information obtained through non-intrusive monitoring with decision support technologies to support safer patient care practices for seniors.","Information and communication services","Collaborative Health Research Projects Selection Panel"

"Memory deficits appear in a variety of neuropathologies and in normal aging. Many of these deficits are related to damage to the medial temporal lobe. In the late 1970s and 1980s, one of the medial temporal lobe structures, the hippocampus, was especially associated with learning and memory. In the 1990s, significant progress was made in specifying the function of the cortices surrounding the hippocampus. It appeared that some of the functions previously assigned to the hippocampus were in fact fulfilled by these cortices. In the recent years, a number of theories proposed that the hippocampus is mainly involved in episodic memory, i.e. the creation of lasting event-context memories. The present research program is aimed at investigating in rats the distinct functions of the hippocampus itself and of a neighbouring structure, the subiculum, which has been much less studied at the behavioral level. One of the objectives of the program is to examine how the hippocampus and the subiculum contribute differentially to the automatic recording and retrieval of the multiple cues that make context-specific events and that are the basis of episodic or episodic-like memories. Another objective is to examine how the hippocampus and the subiculum contribute differentially to the automatic recording of sequences of events or episodes. Two neurobiological techniques are used in the proposed experiments: selective lesions of the hippocampus and subiculum as well as their subregions and reversible inactivation of the same structures by microinfusions of muscimol. A variety of behavioral paradigms are used, including new spatial and contextual tasks, appetitive trace classical conditioning, serial tasks where the rat has to learn where and when an event took place and what was this event. By combining these neurobiological techniques and innovative behavioral procedures, we hope to contribute to the characterization of the functions of the hippocampus and the subiculum in episodic-like memory in spatial and nonspatial tasks.

"Evolutionary transitions that occur repeatedly over the course of history are of inherent interest to biologists. One such transition involves a fundamental change in the way organisms reproduce and has occurred at least 100 times in the flowering plants alone: the evolution of separate sexes from hermaphroditism. During this transition, individuals cease being able to reproduce as both female and male parents (i.e., hermaphrodites) and instead act solely as mothers or fathers to their offspring (i.e., dioecy). Why should individuals give up one of their sex roles to become specialist females or males? Biologists going back to Darwin have thought about this question, but two key issues remain unclear - issues that can begin to be resolved using the combination of modern molecular genetics and experimental manipulations that characterizes the research proposed here. First, the importance of ecological conditions in evolutionary transitions to dioecy is widely recognized but poorly understood. I will provide the first empirical investigation of the effects of environmental conditions on a key step in the evolution of dioecy - the evolution of males - using experiments and genetic analysis of the native plant Sagittaria latifolia. This species is unusual in having both dioecious and hermaphroditic populations, making it an ideal experimental system. Second, there is evidence that dioecious lineages contain fewer species than hermaphrodite lineages, but the processes responsible are largely unknown. Much can be learned about the effect of combined vs. separate sexes on patterns of diversity using lineages that have undergone rapid diversification in their sexual systems. The Canary Islands radiation of Echium appears to be such a lineage, with one quarter of species having dimorphic breeding systems. Using genetic and field studies of Echium, I will investigate the historical and contemporary processes that shape the evolution of combined vs. separate sexes. The combination of approaches proposed here will provide (a) novel insights into the evolution of dioecy, and (b) training for students in high-throughput molecular genetics, and advanced experimental design and statistics - highly sought skills across a range of biological careers.

"The proposed research plan aims to develop a new comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of microbial contaminants in drinking water sources. The proposed research will focus on monitoring and hydrodynamic model calibration and validation for key microbial contaminants: Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Campylobacter, cyanobacteria, and cyanotoxins. It is hypothesized that densities of microbial contaminants in source waters will be influenced primarily by changes in watershed conditions from snowmelt or precipitation events and will respond to changes in nutrient and sediment fluxes. Knowledge of the dynamic interrelationships between environmental factors and microbial contaminants will facilitate the prediction of baseline and peak occurrences of pathogens and cyanobacterial toxins. The ability to predict densities of microbial contaminants in surface waters will assist with the selection of water treatment processes and will guide treatment plant operations.  Furthermore, the development of a model will help planners with making important decisions for source water protection that impact both ecosystems and human health.

"My research investigates how the brain makes decisions. Most research into this issue examines the brain processes involved in choosing actions that are guided by sensory cues such as when navigating a traffic light. Green means go. Red means stop. Many of our every day decisions, however, are not as straightforward because no option is uniquely 'correct'. This is particularly true in competitive situations in which the outcome of our actions depends not only on our own choice but that of opponents. Common examples include a game of tag, a penalty-shot in hockey, placing a bet in poker, and investing in the stock market. I pioneered an approach to studying the brain processes underlying strategic decisions which involves applying tasks developed by economists in the neuroscience laboratory. We both measure and alter brain activity while subjects compete in strategic games like 'rock-paper-scissors'. If activity within a brain region predicts upcoming choices (i.e., 'mind-reading'), this provides correlational evidence that it is involved in strategic decision-making. Furthermore, if upcoming choices can be altered through manipulation of activity within a brain region (i.e., 'mind-control'), this provides causal evidence that it is involved in strategic decision-making. Using these two techniques we are currently investigating which brain regions become activated to control strategic actions. Other experiments examine how multiple brain regions that are involved in choosing strategic actions become coordinated when multiple motor systems are involved (e.g., eye-hand coordination). Understanding the brain mechanisms involved in choosing strategic actions can help explain why people often appear to behave ""irrationally"" according to current economic models. Neuroeconomic models could, in turn, lead to more realistic policies for regulating such institutions as financial markets, insurance markets and lotteries to name but a few.

"GEOACOUSTIC INVERSION: Seabed geoacoustic parameters, such as sediment layering structure, sound speed, density, attenuation and scattering strength, strongly affect the propogagion of ocean acoustic fields. Hence, knowledge of these parameters is required to understand and model sound propagation in shallow-water environments, as required for many sonar applications (as well as geotechnical and geological purposes). Estimating seabed parameters from ocean acoustic measurements provides an economical and convenient in situ alternative to direct sampling (e.g., coring), with a sensitivity relevant to sonar. However, this requires solving a strongly nonlinear inverse problem that is inherently nonunique (i.e., a range of solutions can acceptably fit the data). A variety of geoacoustic inversion approaches have been applied, with varying degrees of success, including the inversion of full-field acoustic measurements, acoustic reverberation, seabed reflectivity, ambient noise, and ship noise. These approaches differ in their ability to estimate various geoacoustic parameters and to resolve parameter variations as a function of depth and/or range; however, the efficacy of these approaches has not been examined in a systematic or rigorous way. The overall objectives of this proposal are to develop and quantitatively study and compare the above-mentioned approaches to geoacoustic inversion. A key component of quantitative analysis of geoacoustic inversion is estimating the uncertainties of the recovered parameters, which indicates the information content of the data and provides an objective basis for comparison of different data sets. Further, only with quantitative uncertainty estimation can issues such as resolving parameter spatial variability or frequency dependence be addressed in a meaningful manner (e.g., differentiating uncertainty from variability). Parameter uncertainty estimation in nonlinear inversion is itself a challenging research problem. This proposal is based on a Bayesian inference formulation and a numerical (statistical) sampling approach, under development, that builds up probability distributions for the unknown seabed parameters based on the data and available physical constraints (prior information).

"Many significant advancements in biological science have followed technological advancements in analytical chemistry, which afford new opportunities for sample analysis. Proteomics is a perfect example of this, where advances in mass spectrometry, separation science, and computational analysis have permitted the comprehensive characterization of proteins. In doing so, one can essentially obtain a 'molecular' description of an organism, and therefore provide an improved understanding of biological pathways, assist in drug design, and also provide molecular fingerprints which identify a particular state of an organism (a.k.a. disease biomarkers). Current challenges in proteome analysis continue to evolve, as new technologies are created. What was once a problem of ionization and interpretation of mass spectrometry patterns, proteomics now focuses (among other aspects) on further increasing sample throughput to enable the analysis of clinically significant sample sizes. The characterization of protein modifications, quantitation of changing protein expression, and the validation of mass spectral data also continue to be topics of continued research in this field. 

          The current application focuses on the development of innovative technologies incorporating separations and mass spectrometry for improved analysis of proteome samples. Proposed is the development of a unique platform for comprehensive and comparative profiling of proteome samples.  This analytical strategy will therefore be applicable to clinical biomarker discovery or for fundamental investigations of protein samples. The approach is based on extensive proteome prefractionation, which will be accomplished using uniquely designed gel-free separation systems. Integration with mass spectrometry is afforded by a novel approach to protein digestion. The techniques also provide new opportunity for targeted analysis of enriched protein samples. These technologies will provide greater throughput, sensitivity, and selectivity of the detection platform, and also increase the validity of the data interpretation and analysis.

"Perinatal (i.e. around the time of birth) brain development is a complex and highly dynamic period in all mammals, including rats and humans.  The brain growth spurt in particular, which occurs in late 3rd trimester in humans but in the first 3 postnatal weeks in rats, is a time of massive changes in brain chemistry and in the connections formed between neurons, that will ultimately determine brain function.  The complexity of the brain growth spurt also makes it a window of vulnerability for the developing organism, in which seemingly minor trauma or chemical toxicity can result in developmental abnormalities that later manifest in neurological disease.  Many of society's most important neurological disorders are often neurodevelopmental in origin, including epilepsy, cerebral palsy, autism, and schizophrenia.  Schizophrenia is a psychiatric diagnosis that describes a mental illness generally characterized by impairments in the perception or expression of reality, often in the context of significant social dysfunction. Many believe that damages to the developing nervous system may lay dormant until maturity and then be expressed in the symptoms of schizophrenia. Understanding disease and developing new therapies requires animal models that mimic the origins and the ultimate presentation of the clinical condition.  Thus, development and characterization of new models in which hypotheses can be tested can provide insight into mechanisms of human neuropathological diseases. We have previously shown that early alterations in excitatory transmission, during critical periods of brain development, produce lasting changes which are suggestive of some of the symptoms manifested in schizophrenia. The focus of the proposed experiments is to better characterize these changes with respect to their relevance to schizophrenia.  Results from these studies will offer a better understanding of the relationship between changes in perinatal glutamatergic signaling and lasting alterations in neurobehaviour and brain circuitry relevant to schizophrenia and other neurological diseases.

"The evolution of the land plant habit has culminated in the vast array of vascular plant species that now dominate terrestrial ecosystems and are essential in providing food, fibre, and energy for human activities.  Key evolutionary innovations were likely required for the adaptation of land plants to the terrestrial environment, including evolution of metabolic pathways for defense, communication, and structural purposes. Furthermore, development of cellulose and lignin-rich secondary cell walls in xylem and secondary xylem (wood) was required in vascular land plants for structural support and nutrient/water transport. The focus of this proposal is on the nature and regulation of key processes such as natural product biosynthesis and fibre/secondary cell wall/wood differentiation and formation in model plants (Arabidopsis, moss, poplar) and commercially valuable (poplar, spruce) trees. Specifically, our experiments will investigate newly discovered genes encoding enzymes for a potentially novel class of natural products required for pollen viability and genes encoding enzymes for the biosynthesis of the signaling compound jasmonic acid, required for response to environmental stresses such as insect attack. We will also study regulatory genes such as transcription factors and receptor kinases involved in programming cells to differentiate into xylem and fibre cells rich in cellulose and lignin, and study a class of cell wall localized chitinase-like proteins that appear to facilitate cellulose deposition into cell walls. This research will provide basic information about these unique aspects of plant function and suggest how these processes might be modified, with potential practical spin-offs in plant fertility control and resistance to insect pests. The work on regulation of secondary cell wall formation and fibre/xylem differentiation has important implications for understanding the formation of biomaterials (fibre and wood) that will be increasingly important as energy and carbon sources in the coming decades and may suggest new ways to manipulate and/or select for plant and tree genetic variants that will be more amenable for biomass and/or biofuels applications.

Studies are proposed for both uncoated and coated paper which integrate process engineering research and materials engineering research. The overall objective is to understand the structure of both types of paper, the processes of drying and coating paper, and how these interact to impact on paper properties and paper quality. 



Uncoated paper is a complex fibrous material while coated paper has the additional complication of having a composite layered structure. The description of paper structure and paper drying involves mathematical modeling and process simulation at the microscale within the sheet interior and in the plane of the sheet.  



The results of this microscale modeling of paper structure and papermaking processes are expressed for application and use in the form of computer software.

"My research focuses on systems aspects of carbon capture and storage and in particular on the development of models and optimisation strategies to reduce CO2 emissions.  Over the past decade our group has developed simulation, design and optimisation models for:



- CO2 capture from point sources (fossil fuel generating stations, cement plants, H2 plants, oil sands processing plants and oil refineries)

- transportation and storage of CO2 in the Province of Ontario

- solid oxide fuel cells (detailed CFD models and balance of plants models)

- IGCC plants fuel by coal and pet-coke for production of electricity and hydrogen

- large scale fleet-wide models (Ontario's fleet of electric generating stations, Alberta's oil sands plants). 



These models can be combined with costing and optimisation models to develop optimal fleet-wide or regional strategies involving the incorporation of conservation, new technologies for power generation and carbon capture & storage. 



I wish to pursue two research problems related to carbon capture and storage in the next five years; they are the development of:



1. large-scale, fleet-wide planning models incorporating CO2 reduction targets  



2. optimal dispatch schedules for a fleet of electric generating stations with CO2 constraints present.

"With rapid advances in technology, system complexity and increased signal speeds, significant demands are placed on Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools to provide the same efficiency and accuracy. Innovations in fabrication process technology have significantly reduced the feature sizes of integrated circuits and increased packing densities of chips. Aggressive design objectives such as system on chip or system in package coupled with increased operating frequencies require multidisciplinary design methodologies such as electrical, thermal and electromagnetic analysis to accurately model high-speed integrated circuits. Furthermore, advances in process technology have introduced novel integrated sensors and actuators, popularly referred to as the micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). The design of MEMS requires knowledge of multiple engineering principals such as electronics, mechanics, optical, thermal and fluids. As a result of these technological advancements, the underlying algorithms of traditional EDA tools have become ineffective and in some cases obsolete in addressing the multidisciplinary nature and computational complexity of modern designs. 

    Currently, multidisciplinary systems such as integrated circuits and MEMS are not handled appropriately by simulators and stand as one of the major bottlenecks in design. The proposed research will develop advanced modeling and simulation algorithms to reduce computational complexity of system design. This will be achieved by extending the scope of macromodeling and model-order-reduction algorithms to efficiently link distributed, electromagnetic and MEMS modules in a unified simulation environment.

"Mathematical models for the marine environmental sciences embody theoretical notions of how these systems operate. Models are well established for ocean currents, and are emerging for ocean biology. These mathematical models are typically large and complex, and generally solved numerically on a computer. Technological advances have led to a measurement revolution for marine systems in the form of new sensors for physical, biological and chemical variables, as well as new observing platforms such as satellites, automated ocean observatories, and underwater autonomous vehicles. The environmental data coming from these instruments is complex. A major challenge is how to effectively use the information coming from both model predictions and observations to optimally determine the state of the ocean (a problem that has come to be known as data assimilation).



This research program is concerned with applying advanced statistical methods to the data assimilation problem. Mathematical modeling and measurement technology have far outstripped the development of statistical methods for combining models and data. This proposed research program intends to address this knowledge gap through the development and application of advanced statistical methods that fuse these different sources of information. These approaches rely on computational Monte Carlo methods and Bayesian reasoning. They provide a new class of general statistical methods for addressing the data assimilation problem for marine environmental systems, and ultimately contribute towards improved marine environmental prediction.

"We propose to explore how variations in the physical environment, which cause year-to-year changes in the amount and type of micro-algae (phytoplankton) produced in an marine ecosystems can affect the amount of zooplankton produced in these same regions.



Zooplankton represent the key link from the bottom of the food chain to higher trophic levels, such as fish.  Thus, understanding the various physical and biological factors that regulate zooplankton production from year to year can provide insights into how future changes in ocean climate may ultimately affect the amount (and the quality) of food available to fish in Canadian waters.



This research program will involve a combination of laboratory and field studies designed to explore the factors that regulate zooplankton production.  Field studies will be conducted in the Strait of Georgia and the open northeast Pacific Ocean, while laboratory work will be conducted at the University of Victoria.

"Urinary tract infections are among the most common bacterial diseases of humans and animals. Most of these infections are caused by uropathogenic strains of the bacteria Escherichia coli. Over half of all women and approximately 10% of men experience at least one bladder infection, the most common type of urinary tract infection. The treatment of urinary tract infections caused by uropathogenic E. coli is complicated because these bacteria spend part of their life cycle within the epithelial cells that line the bladder, protected from the immune system and from many antibiotics. Because only a few of the currently available antibiotics penetrate bladder epithelial cells, the increasing occurrence of antibiotic resistant uropathogenic E. coli infections leaves few, and in some patients, no appropriate drug choices for treatment. Treatment failure can result in infertility, kidney infection, bloodstream infection, and death.  The failure of traditional antibiotic therapy to cure resistant uropathogenic E. coli infections prompted us to explore novel alternatives, such as the metal gallium. Gallium is known to accumulate at sites of infection in the body, and has strong antibiotic activity. We aim to determine if gallium compounds arrive at, and eradicate the bacteria living in bladder epithelial cells during a urinary tract infection. Using conventional laboratory techniques, it is very difficult to accurately determine the chemistry and location of drugs within cells. However, the intense, highly focused x-rays generated at the Canadian Light Source synchrotron can be used with a powerful microscope to analyze the chemistry of tissue samples. Using this method, we will be able to visualize gallium distribution in bladder epithelial cells in mice, and we will be able to determine if the gallium actually enters the bacteria that are hidden in the bladder cells. This will provide valuable insight into how gallium compounds can be used to provide an effective alternative to traditional antibiotics for treating infections that affect millions of Canadians.","Medical and health sciences","Collaborative Health Research Projects Selection Panel"

"Throughout our life, we learn new sequences of movements (e.g., playing the piano, typing, swinging a golf ball) so that these can be performed in a fast and automatic fashion after extensive practice. The advent of neuroimaging techniques that allow mapping brain activity in vivo during learning have led to a growing description of which human brain regions globally contribute to learning such motor skills. Nonetheless, current research does not provide yet a precise picture of how the activity of these brain structures are dynamically shaped by motor sequence practice, especially in the first step of learning during which the memory trace is created. The main objectives of this research program are thus to employ innovative, state of the art neuroimaging techniques in healthy humans to better comprehend how this crucial initial phase of learning dynamically shapes and alters the functioning of the numerous brain structures known to be engaged in motor skill acquisition, and in motor sequence learning (MSL) in particular. Furthermore, although a plethora of studies have already investigated the brain plasticity related to this form of memory, this field of research has completely neglected an important part of the central nervous system which lies between the brain and the motor effectors (e.g., muscles of the hand): the spinal cord that can be found within the vertebras. Functional activity within the latter has recently been shown to be modulated by a variety of motor tasks, but no researcher has yet looked at the role of the spinal cord in motor sequence learning. Through a multimodal electrophysiological-imaging approach, we thus propose to address this question. I expect that, for the first time, this work will increase our knowledge base on the interaction between brain and spinal cord in MSL, and that it will have major clinical applications for patients requesting rehabilitation.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences"

"1995 marked astronomical history with the detection of the first planet outside the solar system. A decade later, more than 200 exoplanets have been detected indirectly by measuring the tiny wobble movement of the star induced by the gravitational influence of a revolving planet. While these discoveries have greatly advanced our knowledge of exoplanets in general, progress remains limited by our inability to take direct images of these fascinating objects. Direct imaging of exoplanets, though very challenging, will help understand their nature and determine their frequency in the solar neighbourhood. The ultimate goal of this endeavour is to determine the ubiquity of the solar system and the prevalence of life in the universe.  

Cousins to Jupiter-like exoplanets are brown dwarfs, those ""failed"" stars that do not have enough mass to ignite thermonuclear fusion reactions in their core as normal stars do. Brown dwarfs are the missing link between the least massive stars and gas giant planets like Jupiter. Since the coldest brown dwarfs have surface temperatures similar to exoplanets, studies of cold brown dwarfs can shed light on exoplanets in general. However, both exoplanets and cold brown dwarfs are very difficult to detect. The former are much fainter than their parent star and the latter are very faint and rare.

This proposal is to continue and expand on an ongoing research program aiming to: 1) detect exoplanets around nearby young stars through direct imaging using novel and well-proven high-contrast imaging techniques on the 8m Gemini telescope and 2) continue the first infrared proper motion survey targeted at finding new nearby brown dwarfs using the recently commissioned wide-field infrared camera CPAPIR which is currently the IR camera with the largest field of view in the world. These surveys will likely unveil new imaging detection of exoplanets and find the coldest brown dwarfs.

"Bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli cause a wide array of diseases in humans and domestic animals. E. coli is a highly adaptive bacterial species that is both a member of the normal intestinal flora and a versatile pathogen associated with numerous types of gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal diseases such as urinary tract infections, meningitis, septicaemia, and haemolytic uremic syndrome.  

The spectrum of diseases caused by different types of E. coli strains is due to the acquisition of specific virulence genes that are absent from the non-pathogenic strains. Current knowledge suggests numerous putative virulence systems may be commonly used by pathogenic E. coli to cause diseases in either humans or livestock. However, the specific mechanisms by which pathogenic E. coli cause extra-intestinal disease in humans and animals are poorly understood. The long-term objective of our research is to identify and further understand the key factors that permit pathogenic E. coli strains to cause extra-intestinal disease. The short-term goals of our research are to determine the specific role of putative virulence genes from a Escherichia coli strain that causes extra-intestinal disease in poultry. Importantly, many of the uncharacterised pathogen-specific genes we have identified from the avian pathogenic E. coli strain are also present in E. coli strains causing human extra-intestinal disease. By using molecular biology techniques, we have identified pathogen-specific genes that are expressed by an avian E. coli strain within the extra-intestinal tissues of infected chickens.  Once these potential virulence regions are identified, we inactivate or delete these specific regions and determine if they contribute to the capacity of the strain to cause disease in chickens. We anticipate our research will lead to better diagnostics to differentiate extra-intestinal E. coli pathogens from non-pathogenic E. coli strains. Further, discovery of novel proteins required and produced by pathogenic E. coli during infection may lead to the development of effective vaccines against this important pathogen of humans and livestock.

"The increasing impact of human activities on the physical and natural environment has resulted in many unplanned land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes. Activities such as urbanization, deforestation and industrial development are now strongly associated with urban sprawl, while natural hazards such as forest fires and insect infestations have generally reduced the quality of the natural landscape. LULC change processes are difficult to predict as they are influenced by many complex and non-linear interactions between variables from human and biophysical systems. The long-term goal of this research program is to advance scientific understanding about the structure and mechanisms of LULC change processes for improving spatial prediction and decision-making. Complexity science and GIScience will be used as the theoretical foundations to develop dynamic and realistic land transformation models. The main objectives are to develop: (1) novel agent-based modeling (ABM) and CA approaches within geographic information systems (GIS) and Web-GIS frameworks; (2) soft computing approaches for handling and processing complex geospatial data sets at multiple spatial and temporal scales; (3) parallel processing methods and algorithms for robust geosimulations of large geospatial datasets; and (4) calibration and validation methods to generate reliable and useful models for spatial decision-making in planning and management contexts. Linking the developed approaches and tools to stakeholder collaboration methods will narrow the gap between modeling at a research level and meaningful real-world applications. This research contributes to expanding the scientific knowledge of LULC change processes and to advancing the field of GIS and GIScience to include dynamic capabilities using innovative spatial modeling approaches. The implementation of spatial decision support systems and tools based on the LULC models will further aid collaborative environmental planning and management. Scientists, planners and policy-makers in forestry, agriculture, and urban land-use will benefit from this research by having objective and scientific foundations on which to make effective decisions.","Land development","Environmental Earth Sciences"
"Ribosomes are the organelles that synthesize proteins in all living organisms. These ""machines"" are constituted of large RNA molecules and multiple proteins. The key components of ribosomes are the ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) as they are directly involved in the different steps of protein synthesis.

     The biogenesis of ribosomes is a major cellular process, and it is a prerequisite for cells to grow in size and proliferate. In eukaryotes, this process takes place in the nucleolus, a prominent compartment of the cell nucleus. The majority of nucleolar factors actually function at various steps of the intricate pathway that leads to the production of mature rRNAs.

     My laboratory is interested in the cellular and molecular events that lead to the production of mature rRNAs. More specifically, we focus on the cleavage reactions that remove extra sequences from precursor rRNA molecules. Our objective is to define the role of nucleolar factors that interact with small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins that are essential for the cleavage reactions.

     We are using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to take advantage of its well-characterized genetic, biochemical and molecular biology tools. We are currently studying the protein Dbp4 and two other factors that apparently help Dbp4 in its function. Dbp4 is a putative RNA helicase that could act as a molecular motor to rearrange RNA-RNA or RNA-protein interactions during the cleavage steps. Importantly, Dbp4 and its associated factors are conserved among species and they are essential for growth, indicating that they perform crucial cellular functions. Human homologues of these proteins are involved in embryonic development and cancer (the homologue of Dbp4, DDX10, has recently been identified as a ""cancer gene""). Understanding how these three proteins function in the cell will contribute to the elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying critical cellular processes in all eukaryotes and open new avenues for the treatment of human diseases.","Advancement of knowledge","Molec. & Develop.

"In the eastern Canadian boreal forest it is well documented that even-aged management is shifting the land base into a much younger mosaic of forest cover types, considerably reducing the mature to old-growth portion of the age-class distribution of natural forests. Provided the increasing context of human influence in this ecosystem, older forest cover types (> 100 years) are likely to become habitats of concern from a biological conservation standpoint. The persistence in time of a reduced proportion of the land base in older forests should also affect populations of species associated with these habitats or their attributes. Better knowledge of the response of older forest species is thus critical in the assessment of the sustainability of boreal forest bird communities. In the last decade several studies have documented the occupancy (presence-absence or relative abundance) patterns of boreal birds in older forests. Findings converge towards the fact that boreal birds' responses to habitat loss and fragmentation induced by timber harvesting were not as strong as those in temperate forest ecosystems, perhaps because land conversion is low and total forest cover does not change. Much less is known about the effects of loss of older forests on reproductive activity of forest birds. In this research program we measure and compare in dynamic natural and managed landscapes: (1) the reproductive activity of open-cup (ovenbird in boreal mixed-wood and golden-crowned kinglet in black spruce forests) and cavity excavators (woodpeckers) in forest remnants and undivided forest tracks (2) habitat quality of forest remnants and larger forest tracks as resource patches with regards to both foraging and nesting requirements of cavity excavators (3) the probability of persistence of these target species in reduced older forest habitat given their population size (density of territorial males) and reproductive performance (reproductive and nesting success).

"Hydrometallurgy of Base and Precious Metals



This proposal outlines a program to continue research and development in a number of important areas related to recovery and processing of base and precious metals.

The pressure leaching of nickel sulfides is the first area of investigation. Pressure leaching is an alternative to conventional smelting processes and involves direct extraction of nickel and by-product metals into a water-based solution.  The metals are then recovered from solution by a number of processes.  The behaviour and control of elemental sulfur will be studied.  Surfactants can be added to disperse sulfur from mineral surfaces, allowing leaching to proceed.

The recovery of metals and cyanide from gold mill effluents will be investigated.  In this work, the use of organic solutions (solvents) containing tailored chemical extractants, or ion exchange resins, will be used to selectively extract target metals and cyanide from waste solutions from gold mill effluents.  This will allow by-product metal recovery and cyanide recycle, ensuring economic and environmental benefits.

The formation of iron precipitates under high temperature and pressure conditions will be studied with a view to preparation of ferric sulfate rich solutions for mineral leaching.  This approach has been developed for application at a copper processing plant in Laos.  In this work, a deeper understanding of the formation and releaching of the basic precipitate will be undertaken with a view to development of new applications in metal extraction and recovery.

"The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a molecular biology technique used to amplify target regions of DNA.  It can also be used to amplify target regions of RNA, if preceded by the reverse transcription of RNA to DNA.  PCR allows for the easy detection of even trace amounts of DNA or RNA in a sample.  Recently, the addition of dyes and probes that fluoresce only when incorporated into DNA during PCR allows for the real-time quantification of PCR products.  This innovation has proven extremely useful, for example, in understanding how cells turn genes on and off according to metabolic needs and in response to environmental stressors by providing a quantitative measure of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts.  Further, melting of the PCR products following the final PCR cycle allows for, by fluorescence, the separation of genotypes and the identification of mutations.  These newest applications require a special PCR thermocycler that has optics for fluorescence excitation and emission detection, i.e., a ""real-time PCR machine"".  We are requesting a real-time PCR machine, the Rotor-Gene RG6, to utilize these innovations for our student-oriented research programs in ecotoxicology (Drevnick and Couture), biogeochemistry (Laurion), and wastewater treatment (Brar and Tyagi).

"During the past 200 years, humans have contaminated the surface of the Earth with mercury.  When mercury reaches surface water (oceans, lakes, rivers), it can be transformed to methylmercury, which accumulates to high concentrations in fish and causes toxicity.  Consumption of contaminated fish is the major way humans are exposed to methylmercury and it is detrimental to health.  All provinces and territories in Canada, except Nunavut, have fish consumption advisories due to methylmercury.  The first objective of this research will be to study the environmental processes that influence the transformation, or ""methylation"", of mercury to methylmercury.  In British Columbia, we will study what determines how much mercury in the air is eventually available for methylation in lakes.  In Quebec, we will study how the delivery of sulfate (acid rain) to lakes influences methylation.  In Nunavut, we will study how the warming of lakes may actually cause some methylmercury to be transformed back to inorganic mercury.  Ultimately, we wish to understand these processes well enough to be able to recommend management practices to reduce methylmercury concentrations in fish to the point that restrictions on consumption can be lifted.  The second objective of this research will be to study the effects of methylmercury on the fish themselves.  Fish are valuable resources, not only for humans but also intrinsically for ecosystems, and it wasn't known until fairly recently that methylmercury causes toxicity in fish, too.  We will study how methylmercury affects the reproduction, growth, and survival of important fish species (walleyes, northern pike) in lakes of Quebec.  This information will be useful for the proper regulation of sport and commercial fisheries that are contaminated with methylmercury.

"In my research, I incorporate detailed models based on the physics of interaction between light and surfaces to (a) understand images and video and hence the underlying lights and surfaces that created them; and (b) use these same effects in reverse to create realistic scenes in graphics.  



I have developed a method  for generating (Computer Graphics) and understanding (Computer Vision) images using {\it whole spectra}, rather than just the usual Red, Green, and Blue of ordinary images. At the end of the day, in fact our visual equipment uses R, G, and B, but on the way, light is transmitted as a whole spectrum, including some red, green, etc., as well as every colour in between. So far, I have created a medical imaging application, for seeing inside volumes, that transforms magnetic MRI data into computer graphics. Since whole spectra are now available, some of the organs, bone, skin etc. can take on a unified colour (or no colour) while other organs are highlighted, and this can happen in real-time, while we use a slider.  I propose using the method to tackle difficult physics-based imagery such as the beautiful effects involved in insect iridescence, diamond facets, and the like.



In Computer Vision, I have been looking at ways to {\it remove shadows} from images. This is very useful for such tasks as having a robot grasp an object without trying to grasp its shadow, tracking

people in a security situation, etc. But it can also be used as simply a touch-up tool for images -- removing dark shadows on a face in a digital photo, say.  Shadows are useful in themselves, not just to be removed: they provide a profound cue about shape and lighting. I set out approaches in this proposal that help in the difficult issue of how to ""re-light"" images, by changing the shadows.

"To meet growing demands for fish products and encourage healthier diet choices by Canadians, the aquaculture

industry has been growing at an annual rate of 8-10%. Growth has brought challenges to the industry,

including the need to decrease reliance on declining global supplies of fish meal as the major protein source for

carnivorous fish such as salmon and trout. Plant ingredients have potential as feed ingredients for carnivorous

fish and developing this opportunity has the added benefit of creating another market for Canadian producers

of crops such as soybean, canola and peas. Unfortunately, plant ingredients cause intestinal inflammation in

salmonid fish, which has a negative impact on fish growth and health. The negative effects of plant ingredients

on salmonid fish may be due to direct interactions of ingredients with the intestine or they may be indirect

effects, resulting from feed ingredients causing changes in the complex intestinal microbial community that in

turn affect intestinal physiology. By studying the effects of various individual plant ingredients and mixtures

on fish growth, intestinal health and the intestinal microbial community, components of the ingredients

responsible for the negative effects can be identified and insight gained into the mechanisms responsible.

Results of this work will determine the type and degree of processing of plant ingredients required to reduce

their negative impact on fish growth and health. An understanding of the mechanisms at work in the

interaction between diet composition and intestinal health will lead to the formulation of improved, sustainable

diets for the aquaculture industry and in the future selection and formulation of diets including new plant

ingredients.

"The research program is the area of extracting information from multichannel audio. Themes include (1) surround sound with microphone arrays, (2) audio signal processing from arbitrary microphone arrays including arrays made from smartphones, and (3) processing of signals from hydrophone arrays in underwater cabled ocean observatory networks VENUS and NEPTUNE.   Applications range from film sound design to teleconferencing to sound environment monitoring to marine biology. The unifying theme is multichannel audio signal processing. The research uses real-world measured data and is guided by interaction with end users.

Theme (1) is to create better sound for film and games. The objective is to develop methods to obtain natural surround sound corresponding to a real acoustic environment (as seen on-screen), while retaining the intelligibility and the correctly perceived direction (location, angle of arrival) of the various sound sources, including voices, musical instruments, and foley effects. A longer term objective is to explore enhancements of theatre sound such as binaural recordings from headsets or folding headrests at each seat.

Theme (2) is inspired by the arrival of smart cellphones with GPS location abilities. The objective is to explore the limits of what can be achieved with microphone arrays made up of multiple smartphones in an arbitrary and changing configuration, enabling auditory scene analysis including the identification, separation, localization, tracking and enhancement of multiple sound sources (voice and other).

Theme (3) is motivated by the opportunities for scientific discovery in the huge volume of audio data available from VENUS and NEPTUNE underwater observatories. The objective is to develop algorithms and tools to find rare events such as marine mammal activity in a large dataset which is mostly noise.

"Steel plate shear walls are a lateral load resisting structural system that has been developed to an advanced stage primarily based on research that focuses on its expected performance under severe earthquake loading. Although the system is undeniably well-suited for high seismic regions, other important potential applications have largely been neglected, such as use in protective structures, industrial structures, and structures where the inherent system redundancy can be used effectively to mitigate potential progressive collapse scenarios. The primary objective of the overall research program is to explore untapped applications for steel plate shear walls in the majority of the regions of Canada, where seismic design considerations are less critical. The initial step in this process is to develop means of rationally relaxing the costly detailing requirements for steel plate shear walls that have been deemed necessary by codes and standards to achieve very high levels of ductility and cyclic robustness. As a major advancement toward achieving the overall program objective, less-stringent design requirements will be developed during this research project for application in low and moderate seismic regions, and their efficacy will be verified in the laboratory by a large-scale physical test designed accordingly. The major benefit of the outcome of this research project to the Canadian construction industry, building design professionals, and building owners will be a well-defined means of designing steel plate shear wall systems economically to take advantage of their inherent seismic performance in low and moderate seismic regions, without costly and unnecessary detailing stipulations.

"Our DNA provides the genetic blueprint for the production of thousands of different proteins that in turn mediate all of the biochemical reactions in our bodies. The current equipment grant application originates from a group of scientists whose fundamental research programs absolutely depend upon the ability, under various experimental conditions, to study the expression levels of particular biomolecules (such as proteins and DNA) in biological systems. Thus, funding is requested for the purchase of a ""biomolecular imager with fluorescence capability"" which constitutes a sensitive, reliable, and highly-flexible instrument for identifying and quantifying individual biomolecules in cultured cells as well as in tissue samples.

"Cells in the body are under constant attack from radiation and chemicals (known as ""mutagens"") in the environment that damage DNA, thus leading to the formation of harmful mutations which alter the genetic code, in turn destroying the function of important proteins. Fortunately our cells possess various ""DNA repair pathways"" that can remove segments of damaged DNA before these segments can be converted into mutations. As such, the major goal of my laboratory has been to better understand the mechanisms surrounding how human cells repair their DNA.



""Ubiquitination"" is a process that directly modifies the chemical structure of proteins, thereby influencing their stability and function. Only during the past 3-4 years, it has been demonstrated that ubiquitination plays a major role in coordination of DNA repair processes. It is important to realize that this coordination often requires that the ubiquitination-type modifications on DNA repair proteins be reversed at some point. In fact there is a family of about 79 proteins in humans, logically referred to as ""deubiquitinases"" (or DUBs for short), that essentially reverse the changes to proteins caused by the ubiquitination process. To date this family of important proteins is only very poorly characterized. To significantly remedy this situation, we will make use of the most current information about the human genome, and state-of-the art technology, to identify and characterize those cellular DUBs involved specifically in the cellular response to environmental mutagens such as solar UV and X-rays.

"The transport and fate of pathogens can be highly influenced by their relationship with suspended and bed sediment particles. Specifically, the pathogen relationship with flocculated particles (composite particles that are held together by physical, chemical and biological means) is important as this association is central to controlling the mobility of pathogens within the aquatic environment and often results in the downward flux of pathogens to the bed sediment. As pathogens can live for prolonged periods within sediments, it may represent a reservoir of pathogens for subsequent remobilization and transport to potentially high risk areas. As such, pathogen dynamics are likely to be strongly linked to aquatic sediment dynamics. It is suggested that the growth and survival of pathogens within aquatic sediments should be of concern to public health officials because of the potential contribution of pathogens to the water column from this source. Current sampling strategies by health departments are based on an assumption that bacteria are entirely planktonic (free-floating) and do not account for the significant concentration of bacteria in sedimentary compartments and the influence that different energy regimes (e.g. currents and waves) may have on pathogen mobilization. There is the potential that this may lead to an inaccurate estimate of risk posed to public health by pathogens and that consideration may be warranted for the possible modification of sampling strategies to reflect the pathogen/sediment association.

"Microwave Pretreatment of Waste Activated Sludge to Enhance Its Anaerobic Digestion



Recent and current work has focused on microwave (MW) pretreatment of biological solids produced in wastewater treatment processes to render them more amenable to anaerobic digestion which reduces the quantity of residual solids for ultimate disposal on the land or for incineration. 

The work proposed is a continuation of the previous work based on the demonstrated improvements that were achieved with MW pretreatment temperatures up to 100oC. Higher temperatures and a wider variety of pretreatment conditions will be studied in the current research to maximize the digestion efficiency (both the rate of digestion and the ultimate amount of digestion that can be achieved) after pretreatment. More basic research will be conducted to understand MW induced transformations to exploit their potential for digestion improvement.

The benefits of the technology include stability of process operation, greater pathogen reduction, higher biogas (methane) yield, lower solids production, and improved sludge dewaterability resulting in a technology that is more economical, easier to operate, and less harmful to the environment. Biogas is able to be captured from anaerobic digestion at a wastewater treatment plant. Greenhouse gas emissions are reduced and reduction of contamination of natural waters occurs through improved digestion of waste solids. Anaerobic digestion is commonly used around the world.

"All animals must acquire energy through their feeding activities but obtain food resources from their environment in different ways depending on 1) the species 2) feeding ecology differences among populations living in different environments and 3) individual variation in feeding behavior within a given environment. Bioenergetics and bioenergetic models provide a method to establish the energy balance (kilojoules of food consumed per day relative to total daily energy needs or field metabolic rate) in animals and when coupled with biomass/production estimates allow an assessment of the trophic impacts, or the ecological footprint, of a given population on its environment. This type of information is needed to validate theoretical models of food web structure and to test the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem stability. Developing methods to measure animal bioenergetics in natural environments also has applications to establish the implications of fish stocking programs, invading species or fluctuations in key prey items in an ecosystem. Characterizing bioenergetics parameters (e.g. growth and food consumption) also allows assessment of the relative health of a population. Many stressors (e.g. toxic chemicals, nutrient enrichment, habitat loss and global warming) manifest themselves as bioenergetic effects and can provide an early warning of impacts of stressors on the population. This proposal will evaluate the use of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) as tracers of energy acquisition and feeding rates in free living aquatic amphibians and fish. Legacy pollutants such as the long-banned PCBs are globally distributed, exhibit reduced toxicity on account of decreases in environmental concentrations, and provide good tracers of ecological structure and bioenergetics. The described methods will use laboratory studies, pond-studies (mesocosms) and natural lakes and several indicator species including: leopard frogs, green frogs, bullfrogs, sunfish and rainbow trout to establish the method of POPs as bioenergetic tracers and evaluate the potential application of this technique to ecosystem management and ecosystem health assessment practices.

"Since the creation of the integrated circuit, more than 4 decades ago, a tenfold increase in computing performance has been achieved every 5 years. The most significant impact of this trend is the continuing decrease of cost-per-chip which has led to significant improvement in economic productivity and overall quality of life though the proliferation of computers, communication and electronics in general. This outstanding improvement is essentially due to the scaling down of the CMOS technology (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor). The aim of this project is not to replace CMOS circuits for general purpose Boolean logic but rather to develop enhanced CMOS technology by adding new functionalities through heterogeneous integration of new nanodevices. The objective of this project consists in stacking Single Electron Devices (SED) (transistors or memories) on existing CMOS technology and providing the tools to make use of such hybrid SED-CMOS technology. The advantages of such an approach are numerous and address major concerns of the industry: larger integration density (3-D vs 2-D), reduced interconnect lengths (to overcome SED fan-out issues), non invasive technology (CMOS fabrication process is not disturbed).

This outstanding improvement is essentially due to the scaling down of the CMOS technology (Complementary Metal Oxide Silicon). The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors anticipates that to continue this trend, innovative solutions must be introduced for post-CMOS technology within the next 10 years. To achieve this, a tremendous research effort on emerging devices or materials must be deployed to bring these technologies to an acceptable maturity level. These emerging research devices will need to be compatible with existing CMOS technologies in order to be heterogeneously integrated with CMOS circuits and capitalize on the established semiconductor industry. Also, these devices have to address the issue of power dissipation (<100 W/cm2) to be considered for a viable solution. We have developed a radically new approach for the fabrication of single electron transistors (SETs) one of the emerging research devices proposed for post-CMOS technology. This engineering breakthrough has allowed us to achieve SET with low impedance and extraordinarily small capacitances (paving the way for high-speed memories and logic devices), and concomitant reliable operation 100�C above room temperature.  This research program will address the issue of energy consumption by capitalizing on the previously developed high power efficiency single electron device platform; 1) to heterogeneously integrated SET with CMOS technology; 2) to investigate new functionalities in single photon detectors and image processing; 3) to increase performance of logic and memory devices.

Being able to predict what will happen in the near future, with reasonable confidence, is an essential skill of humans and computers alike. Knowing what will come next allows people to plan ahead and use their resources efficiently and effectively. For computers to be useful tools, they must emulate this practice. Computers must plan ahead, predicting a user's needs and finding any items that may satisfy them.



As with humans, computers can learn from past experience. But most research so far has assumed that the experience directly carries to the new problem.  In recent times this assumption has become under increasing scrutiny. This project explores the impact of removing this assumption. 



If the change from past experience to a new problem is too large prior experience will not be useful. So some idea of the range and type of changes that a learning system will experience has be obtained. How well existing systems cope with these changes needs analyzing. This will lead to new variants of such algorithms or totally new algorithms that are robust to these changes.



This proposal requests funds solely to support graduate students. It represents a good research topic for new researchers. Those trained in this area will have strong potential as researchers in academia or industry.

"The Arctic remains one of the Earth's least understood environments and yet it is often regarded as an early warning system for many aspects of climate change. There are also the issues of ozone depletion and ultraviolet radiation, and changes in air quality.  The international scientific community unanimously recognizes the acute need for direct observation and measurement of conditions and processes in the Arctic. Many countries have assigned high priority to Arctic research and the current International Polar Year (IPY) effort is a result of this concern. Canada has a particular stake in Arctic research because much of the Arctic land mass is within Canada. However, the opportunities for doing research in the high Arctic are very limited because of the difficulties of maintaining a viable research site.  This proposal is for the funds necessary to maintain the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL) located at a site approximately 15 km from the Meteorological Service of Canada's Eureka weather station and only 1,100km from the North Pole. There is no comparable site in the world. The purpose-built laboratory is unique in its ""clear sky"" nights and ability to monitor and obtain measurements from both inside and outside the winter polar vortex, the focus of much atmospheric research. More than 40 researchers including undergraduate and graduate students, Canadian university and government researchers and international investigators are currently involved in the PEARL facility. Many of these researchers and PEARL itself are also heavily involved in the IPY.  PEARL enables Canadian researchers to perform internationally-competitive as well as scientifically and environmentally relevant atmospheric research in Canada's far North.

"Recognizing the need for increased inter-professional communication and data interchange during large and small scale emergency situations, Centennial College developed the Inter-professional Disaster Emergency Action Studies (IDEAS) Network to stage high fidelity emergency and disaster simulations. Since its inception in 2005 the IDEAS Network has completed seven full-scale multi-disciplinary community simulation exercises involving an extensive collaborative network of more than 3,500 students, faculty and public/private sector professionals across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Through participation in these simulation exercises and analysis of the resulting data, the applied research team at the Centennial College Applied Research and Innovation Centre (ARIC) identified a critical need for applied research in several areas of the emergency situation continuum of prevention, response and recovery. ARIC has grounded its applied research program in

innovation for health care communication and information technology to address the situational and resource awareness inefficiencies in daily emergencies, as well as during large-scale disasters. The overall goal of the proposed two year Mobilizing Technology Solutions project is to engage with industries in the GTA that focus on the area of health care communication technology and to examine and improve current health care resource management and response applications. The researchers will work with this industry sector to provide innovative solutions through creative approaches to interface design by modeling strategic processes and developing smart technologies to provide timely, accurate and concise data analysis to aid in crisis decision making. The result will provide technology applications that maximize the utilization and deployment of health care resources to allow more intelligent day-to-day situational responses, and to enhance situational resilience so as to decrease the recovery time from critical events.

The proposed research concentrates on design of masonry shear wall building for seismic loading and builds on more than 35 years of research, design, and standards writing experience related to masonry.



Although masonry construction accounts for over 70% of the current stock of buildings in North America, its continued use as a major structural system has been severely impeded by concerns regarding earthquake resistance. These concerns have led to restrictive provisions in design codes such as the 2005 edition of the National Building Code which limits use of masonry and places it at a competitive disadvantage.



Previous research at McMaster and elsewhere, although comparatively scarce, clearly shows that with proper design, detailing, and construction, masonry can perform very well under seismic loading. The proposed research is for a comprehensive series of tests and analyses to fully document behaviour of current masonry construction and improved behaviours resulting from innovative forms of construction.



This research will lead to proposals to modify design documents to account for the enhanced characteristics of properly designed masonry structures. Such changes will improve resistance to earthquake loading and reduce construction costs for masonry buildings.

"The objective of this proposed research is to investigate a high-level programming paradigm for context-aware

computing. This paradigm will consist of theoretical and practical foundations for developing programming

languages that enable and support programming context-aware software applications, and software models,

abstractions and infrastructure as the foundations to build context-aware software systems. Here by ""high-level"" we mean that the paradigm will be at a high level of abstraction with support of formal theories. The programming languages and software models, abstractions and infrastructure designed based on the

paradigm will have formal abstract semantics that will be independent of concrete context-aware application

systems and low-level specific operational environments and platforms.

Context-aware computing means that computations of a software application that is aware of, varies in, and

depends on the underlying, runtime contexts and context changes. Here contexts can be generally defined as

external varying environments that affect or determine the computations of the application. Examples of such

external environments or contexts include time, location, situation, and user profile. Context-aware

programming means writing computer programs that specify how computations or behaviors of context-aware

software applications depend on or vary in underlying contexts. The current (low-level) solutions to

context-aware programming are mainly focused on extending conventional programming languages and

systems with context-aware supports in forms of additional software constructs, APIs, and packages.

This proposed research will take an abstract-to-concrete approach to investigating the paradigm. We will

investigate an abstract computing model for context-aware computing. We will investigate high-level

context-aware programming languages for writing context-aware application programs based on the abstract context-aware computing model. We will also investigate implementation of the abstract context-aware

computing model on various concrete context-aware software and hardware platforms/environments.

"My past, current, and future research contributes to improve the implementation of high-level programming languages, and that of functional languages in particular.  Programming has slowly been moving towards higher-level languages, that is, towards simpler, more expressive, more powerful, more intuitive languages.  Programming languages are work tools, and choosing a powerful tool for challenging projects leads to many benefits.  Development and testing times are reduced.  In addition to reductions in times, the resulting software has a tendency to be more reliable.  Consequently, choosing a high-level language is not simply a question of taste or style, but it is also an economically sensible choice.  I am also interested in improving the implementation of other languages too, not exclusively that of high-level ones, and, more generally, I am interested in making software more reliable.  Means of achieving those goals include encouraging the use of high-level languages, of course, but also developing and improving direct reliability- and security-enhancing techniques---like programming with contracts and static and dynamic formal software verification---or, in other words, focussing on the parts of software engineering that are based on programming language technologies.

Projects that I describe include: research on adaptive static analysis, a static analysis whose precision and cost is not fixed but rather parameterized by the abstract model it uses and that is able to progressively refine the abstract model in order to increase precision while keeping the cost relatively low; research on abstract profiling, a static analysis that aims at computing execution behavioral statistics similar to those obtained using conventional program profiling, this static analysis being a good candidate for benefitting from adaptiveness; research on a fast version of a control-flow analysis, with the intent of making it more attractive and favoring its use in compilers; research on software security that consists in applying our new Extended Proof-Carrying Code framework to oracle-based proof reconstruction, for instance; and research on a data compression project, called bit recycling, which is unrelated to software but that has been particularly successful in the recent years.

"Le passe industriel de la plupart des grandes villes ainsi que les pratiques passees de remblayage ont largement degrade le sous-sol des milieux urbains.

La revitalisation des sites contamines urbains est necessaire pour un developpement durable des villes. Cette revitalisation passe d'abord par une caracterisation precise de la distribution des contaminants. Or, cette caracterisation est actuellement entachee d'une incertitude significative due a certaines limites des methodes de caracterisation conventionnelle. Cette incertitude se repercute ensuite sur les couts de rehabilitation des terrains, voire sur le possibilite meme de rehabiliter un terrain. Les principales causes de cette incertitude sont une meconnaissance des conditions souterraines lors de la planification de 1'echantillonnage ainsi qu'un prelevement d'dchantillons non representatif.

"Many polymerization processes result in negative environmental consequences due to the source of the feedstock (e.g., monomer from petrochemical processes), or due to the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). A number of ""greener"" pathways to the production of high quality polymeric materials can be envisaged. We will produce environmentally friendly pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) while exploiting two of these pathways: 1) using renewable materials as polymer feedstock; and 2) using safer, low VOC solvents during production. 

In the last decade, increases in petroleum prices combined with limited oil resources and environmental issues associated with greenhouse gas emissions resulted in rapid growth in biodiesel production. Biodiesel, an environmentally friendly alternative to petrodiesel, is produced by the transesterification of lipid feedstocks with an alcohol. An important by-product of this process is glycerol. The increasing levels of biodiesel production have resulted in a glut of glycerol with price drops from $0.60-$0.90/lb to ~$0.05/lb. Polyglycerol (PG) is a polymer with excellent functionality and the ability to be synthesized from renewable sources. PG can be produced via step-growth polymerization but the production of high molecular weight polymer in this case is extremely challenging. One objective of this research is to produce higher molecular weight PG. Hydrophilic PSAs, in some cases in the form of hydrogels, are needed in various fields of contemporary medical applications. They provide greater adhesion to skin and compatibility with a wide variety of drugs compared to hydrophobic PSAs. PG has excellent hydrophilic characteristics and has available sites for cross-linking, making it an ideal candidate for the synthesis of hydrogel adhesives. It is biocompatible, biodegradable and can be produced from abundant renewable sources. Thus, a second objective will be to produce PG-based PSAs. A third objective will be to introduce environmentally benign solvents derived from renewable materials (e.g., biodiesel) for the production of solvent-based PSAs using sustainable processes.

"The mining industry is of great importance to Canada, employing close to 400,000 Canadians and contributing $40.8 billion to the economy (2003 statistics). The benefits of mining however, come with environmental consequences. Mines discharge significant amounts of treated effluents to surrounding waters (e.g., rivers, lakes). Many efforts have been made to determine whether the release of these effluents causes changes in the quality of the water or the health of the animals that live in the water (e.g., fish and bottom-dwelling insects). However, understanding how waters may be affected by mine effluents is a complicated task. Further, determining if mine effluents are causing change is only the first step towards mitigation and sustainable development. Understanding the causes of the effects (e.g., causative metals) and factors which modify their toxicity is also required to explore solutions. This research seeks to better understand mine effluent effects on waters and to generate information for developing strategies for removing their toxicity. Our objectives are to 1) confirm responses of a fish species (fathead minnow) to metal mine effluents in Sudbury, Ontario using artificial streams with constructed food chains; 2) compare minnow responses to whole effluent mixtures relative to doses of single metals (copper, selenium, thallium); 3) understand the importance of water versus diet as the route of exposure causing toxicity; and 4) explore factors which modify toxicity (pH/alkalinity, organic matter, diet quality and quantity) of effluent mixtures and dominant single metals to fathead minnow. This three year research program will train graduate and undergraduate students in an area of national importance, and involve an integrated combination of laboratory and field studies.

"Protection of our waters depends upon our ability to understand ecosystem complexity enough to attain a level of confidence in predictive relationships between a pollutant and the response of exposed organisms. Due to the complexities of aquatic ecosystems, our understanding of how pollutants (e.g., metals and metal mixtures) affect lotic (river) food webs is limited. Extrapolation of our results from warm water to coldwater fishes is also very limited. The long term objectives of the proposed research are to better understand direct and indirect effects of pollutants including metals on lotic food webs and comparative sensitivities among species of fish. We will use selenium as our model pollutant. Se is an essential micronutrient that is both beneficial and toxic within a narrow concentration range. Mining, irrigation of agricultural land, petroleum refining and coal combustion can increase Se in aquatic ecosystems. Direct (waterborne exposure) and indirect (dietary exposure) effects of Se on the partial lifecycles of warm water (fathead minnow) and cold water (slimy sculpin) forage fishes and the lifecycle of a dominant prey item (midge) will be investigated using simple food webs (algae, invertebrate, fish). A partial lifecycle reproductive bioassay will be developed for slimy sculpin. Sensitivities of fathead minnow and slimy sculpin to Se will be assessed under different temperature regimes and when these fish are interacting in the same self-sustaining four-level food web (algae, invertebrate, slimy sculpin, fathead minnow). This research will better our understanding of how river food webs are affected by Se and the different sensitivities of cold and warm water fishes. Understanding biological responses for single metals will assist our understanding of responses to complex mixtures (e.g., metal mine effluents).","Pollutants and toxic agents (waste, use 902)","Evolution & Ecology"

"Longitudinal data analysis is an important and now well-studied subject in biostatistics with several excellent texts providing various viewpoints on the subject.  However, there are three topics that we wish to emphasize in the current proposal and which are neither part of the focus of these texts nor of the biostatistical and statistical literature.  The first is the modeling of longitudinal data when the response and any time-dependent covariate(s) are not measured at the same time points.  A smoothing step is required, and we will focus upon a binning approach to handle this atypical data structure and allow for longitudinal modeling using traditional mixed effects models.  The second topic is joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data when the longitudinal response is measured both retrospectively and prospectively, whereas the typical arrangement is that the longitudinal response is measured only prospectively, i.e., when the start of the clock of the survival process begins.  A number of issues need to be addressed with this type of data, especially as regard to estimation bias when the amount of retrospective data differs between study participants.  The third topic focuses on implementing a flexible model for longitudinal data that exhibit a gradual change from an increasing to decreasing trajectory over time (or vice versa).  The challenge is to try to obtain a reasonably realistic model for the mean trajectory while not overfitting the data with a high number of difficult to interpret parameters, something that may occur with a nonparametric curve-based approach.   We discuss the mixed-effects bent cable regression model to achieve this often satisfying compromise.  This model will also allow us to account for between-subject heterogeneity in the trajectories including where the changes occur.  HQP (graduate students) will be heavily involved in attempting to address all three of these topics in this proposal.

"Galaxies are the building blocks of the universe.   Our sun (a star) is in orbit around a large disk-shaped system of about four hundred billion stars - a spiral galaxy known as the Milky Way.  Our Milky Way is just one in a 100 billion that we can count in the observable universe.  Understanding the origin of galaxies and how they emerge and evolve is a primary goal in cosmological research.  This proposal focuses on understanding the evolution of disk galaxies within the context of the Lambda-Cold-Dark-Matter cosmological model - the current paradigm for explaining the origin of structure in the universe.  In this model, galaxies are organized systems of stars and gas - stuff we can see - and an invisible component called the halo made of a mysterious substance called the dark matter.  The dark matter halo explains the rotational motion of galaxies and is an essential component of cosmology theory.  Disk galaxies represent the majority of the total galactic population.  When their morphology is quantified in detail, they show wonderful structure in the form of spiral patterns, bars (elongated central structures) and subtle warping at the edges.  The character of these structures also seems to be varying with time with fewer barred galaxies and more disturbed spiral patterns in the past.  The physical mechanism responsible for most of these features is gravity that drives and excites their formation.  The gravitational interaction between the disk of stars and gas with the dark halo is the primary driver.  In this proposal, we model these physical processes using numerical experiments on parallel supercomputers.  We build realistic models of galaxies using particles and compute their equations of motion to simulate the interaction of the stars and dark matter according to the known laws of gravity.  In this numerical laboratory, we can test various hypotheses for the origin of spiral structure and bars as the result of the interaction with surrounding dark matter halo and so explore the consistency of the cosmological paradigm with the observed properties of galaxies.  Computer animations of these processes translate billions of years of dynamical processes into an intuitive presentation of galaxy evolution.

"This new century has seen energy and security issues emerged as new preoccupations. Polymer materials, such as plastics and composites, have an important role to play in the novel technologies that will be developed to address these concerns. Energetic polymers release a significant amount of energy during their decomposition. They are not explosives materials per say, but they find use as binders or core components in solid propellants and gas generator compositions such as automotive airbags or other safety devices. The fuel value of metal particles is several times the one available in liquid and gas fuels. Since the burning of metal nanoparticles is essentially surface controlled, the reduction in size of these particles greatly enhances their combustion. Both of energetic polymers and metal nanoparticles will most likely become key enablers of novel energetic materials. Metal nanoparticles of interest, such as aluminum, boron and magnesium are rapidly covered by an oxide layer reducing their fuel value and shelf-life. This research is aimed at developing innovative processes allowing for an increased use of polymers in the field of energetic materials. Our efforts will be deployed on two fronts: the investigation of microchemical processes as a means of safely producing a novel biodegradable energetic polymers and the development of in-situ polymerization approaches for polymer coating of metal nanoparticles.The microreactors, owing to their very high surface to volume ratio, excel in reactions where heat transfer become a limiting factor, which is often the case in the synthesis of energetic polymers. The coating of metal nanoparticles by polymers is more efficiently achieved by the means of an in-situ polymerization technique. This research program is an answer to a sector of polymer technology in needs of innovation to face contemporary challenges. Smartand recyclable airbags, hypervelocity propulsion systems based on metal nanopowders, environmentally friendly explosive compositions are examples of potential applications. The research offer opportunities to increase our knowledge about polymer reaction engineering in confined space and rheology of nanoparticles suspensions in polymers media.

"Visual data, in the form of diverse types of imagery, remains one of the richest sources of information for both consumers and professionals. With advances in communications services and networks, image-based services have begun to proliferate in recent years, especially those making use of the internet. However, many of these services still offer inadequate quality, realism and responsiveness, especially for very high-resolution imagery and three-dimensional environments. Since such data-intensive services will help to make effective use of the ample communications bandwidth currently available while providing highly desirable and needed services to the business and consumer markets, it is timely to address the unresolved issues in the basic theories underlying high-performance visual communications. 

The general objective of my program is to carry out research on new multidimensional signal processing techniques and data compression algorithms that can be applied to the development of enhanced visual communications and multimedia systems. My long-term goal is to develop systems providing highly realistic and comfortable renditions of environments, scenes and documents at a distance over the global information infrastructure in a cost-effective manner. I am particularly interested in high-quality signal reproduction with advanced features such as stereoscopy and very-high definition, coupled with robustness and flexibility in a heterogeneous environment. The main focus will be on developing new algorithms for the representation of still, time-varying, three-dimensional and multi-view imagery that fully exploit the spatiotemporal redundancy in the signal while maintaining flexibility and robustness. There will be two main themes to my research program: 1. Color image processing and rendering, and 2. Multiview video processing and compression.","Not available","Commun.,Computers & Components"

"Due to the inherent surface sensitivity related to the resonant nature of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect, SPR technology has been known as a leading approach for label-free study of biomolecular interactions for more than 17 years. However, the bulky hardware and elevated hardware cost have prohibited this technology from leaving the laboratory space. We propose to develop a new technology for fabrication of a monolithically integrated SPR biosensing device. The integrated biosensor microstructure holds particular promise for cost-attractive implementations and is especially attractive for the development of hand-held devices. The architecture of the proposed biosensor will be based on our recently discovered effect of efficient coupling the photoluminescence (PL) emission from a semiconductor quantum well (QW) with surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) induced at dielectric-gold-oxide interfaces located above the QW microstructure. A sub-micrometer Au grating, which will be fabricated using a cost-attractive method of nano-imprinting, will allow the observation of resonant interactions between QW PL and SPP leading to the enhanced QW PL signal The sensitivity of this effect to minute perturbations at the Au surface (grating) is expected to be similar to that observed for other SPP effect-based devices. However, our architecture will allow the fabrication of a biosensor that will be: a) miniaturized, as the QW will provide a strong PL signal induced either by an integrated electronic bias or an integrated excitation source (i.e., no need of an external source of excitation), b] self-referencing, as portion of the Au layer without grating will be used to provide a reference signal, and c) highly accurate thanks to an innovative technology of on-board data verification.

The ultimate goal of this research is to manufacture an ultra-sensitive and low-error (highly-specific) portable biosensor that could be used as a stand-alone device or implemented in micro-total analysis system for the detection of pathogens in a way similar to the current home-usable diagnostic devices, such as, for example, tests providing information about pregnancy.

Pour solutionner ce probl�me, nous proposons une nouvelle approche pour la r�alisation d'un biocapteur int�gr� SPR, tr�s prometteuse pour une impl�mentation � faible co�t et pouvant mener au d�veloppement de dispositifs portatifs. L'architecture de ce biocapteur est bas�e sur notre d�couverte r�cente de couplage efficace de l'�mission photoluminescente (PL) d'un puits quantique (PQ) avec des ondes plasmon-polaritons de surface (SPP). La technique peu co�teuse de nano-impression sera utilis�e pour r�aliser un r�seau sub-micronique dans une couche mince d'or d�pos�e sur une couche di�lectrique au-dessus des PQ. Ce r�seau permettra d'observer l'interaction entre la PL des PQ et les SPP, menant � un accroissement du signal PL. La sensibilit� de cet effet, � de faibles perturbations de la surface d'or, devrait �tre similaire � celle observ�e pour d'autres dispositifs SPP.

"Access to instructional information guiding practice has been identified as being one of the most important factors influencing motor learning. The goal of the proposed program of research is to investigate and understand the most optimal methods for the presentation of instructional information to best facilitate motor skill retention.  The delivery of information may follow a prescriptive or a self-regulated access paradigm.  One possible pedagogic advantage of the self-regulated learning is its adaptability to individual learning styles and needs. 



To date the mechanisms underpinning self-regulated learning are not clear.   I will investigate the mechanisms facilitating motor learning process when learners are able to self regulate the access to the instructional information.  Specifically, I will test whether goal-setting, and the nature of the goals may help to explain why learners who self-regulate the delivery of instructional information acquire motor skills to the same extent, or better than those who do not self-regulate.  Complex, real life motor skills will be learned, in order to allow for the task relevance and associated motivation required to optimally study the self-regulated approach to learning.



Collectively, the proposed line of research will enhance our basic understanding of two issues related to skills acquisition.  First, it will inform us about the basic mechanisms underpinning the effectiveness of a self-regulated approach to the learning of complex, real-life motor skills.  Second, it will create a body of knowledge which may be translated into practice to optimize the training curricula of future healthcare providers, resulting in potential economic savings and increased patient safety. As well the findings of the proposed research have application to motor skill learning in sporting and industrial settings.

Respiration is a vital motor behaviour that begins at birth and is maintained throughout life. Pathological changes in breathing can have dire consequences and it is thus crucial to understand the neural mechanisms generating respiration. To do this, both the synaptic connectivity of the entire network as well as the membrane properties of the comprising generator neurons must be identified. The complexity of the mammalian Central Nervous System (CNS) renders this task difficult and we believe that the simpler CNS of lampreys could help provide a detailed understanding. In lampreys, the neural circuitry generating respiration stays active after isolation in vitro of their CNS, and continues to generate respiratory output very similar to that observed in intact animals. We propose to characterize the neural circuitry both at the system (synaptic connectivity) and cellular (intrinsic properties of neurons) levels in the CNS of lampreys. The relative contribution of synaptic and intrinsic properties in respiration will also be established. Finally, we will examine the modulation of respiration by other motor circuits in the isolated CNS. The onset of movements is accompanied by increases in the respiratory drive and previous work from our lab has revealed that the changes are pre-programmed in the CNS. We propose to identify the neural circuitry responsible for these changes. We believe that the information gained in this lower vertebrate CNS will be useful to provide testable hypotheses on the neural organization responsible for respiration in higher vertebrates, including humans.

"RNA-mediated interference, or RNAi, is the specific shut down of a gene's expression by the exposure of cells to double-stranded RNA, or to its derivatives. This phenomenon has had a deep impact on biological sciences in the recent years, primarily for its use to experimentally examine the outcome of the loss of any gene's function in experiments. In the most recent years it is becoming clear that RNAi also serves numerous physiological purposes. Through a diverse variety of related processes, it can profoundly influence gene regulatory networks. In the current research proposal, we put forward an integrated strategy to address the molecular basis for one of these phenomena termed endogenous RNAi (or endoRNAi). EndoRNAi modifies gene expression by converging its silencing signals on chromatin (the physiological architechtures of DNA). We will examine the function of two related proteins required for endoRNAi, which encode tandem tudor domains. Our previous work supports a model wherein these proteins direct the RNAi machinery to reinforce the silenced state of genes. The current proposal will result in a better understanding of the biological functions of RNAi, of the underlying mechanisms, and further elucidate the functions of the tudor domains in gene regulation.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Molec. & Develop.

"This research program aims at developing new on-line process analytical sensors based on spectral imaging and chemometrics methods for measuring variability in chemical processes and product quality that is difficult to quantify using traditional sensors. This information will be useful for dynamic process modelling, monitoring, fault detection and diagnosis, and ultimately for designing automatic process and quality control schemes. The sensors will be developed based on the spatial-spectral information contained in hyperspectral images of processes and products. The UV-VIS-NIR spectral imagers and a high temperature camera recently obtained from two Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) grants will be used for collecting spectral images. Chemometrics methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS) will be used for efficient extraction and analysis of process and/or product quality relevant information contained in the massive amounts of stochastic data making each spectral image data cube. The spectral sensors should allow on-line detection, characterization, and monitoring of composition (organic and several inorganic compounds), morphology, and appearance across the surface of heterogeneous materials and media (i.e. spatial distributions).

    In the next five years, hyperspectral sensors will be developed for 1) stabilising multi-fuel fired combustion processes in recovery boilers and kilns, 2) estimating and controlling quality of extruded polymer composites (surface appearance and mechanical properties) with application to wood-plastic composites, and 3) estimation of growth, differentiation, and death kinetics of 5 different types of cells involved in megakaryopoeisis (ex-vivo blood platelet production). These areas (energy, plastics, and biotechnology) were selected since their production objective often consists of achieving a specific distribution of features within the process itself and/or within the final product. They are also very important fields for the Canadian economy. Training of highly qualified personnel in these areas would help increase international competitiveness.

"My long-term research is dedicated to developing groundbreaking analysis techniques for image-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) within the main applicative context of dementias (e.g. Alzheimer's (AD)). The focus of this NSERC Discovery research program is to develop and validate robust, automated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) feature extraction methods, combined with novel high-dimensional data analysis techniques, to increase CAD accuracy. Specific Objective 1: to develop and validate a) image harmonization techniques; b) automated large scale image quality control methods; and c) a control-theory framework for image processing pipeline optimization, for the extraction of robust, automated MRI features in multi-scanner data. The targeted performance is to achieve <5% inter-scanner intensity and registration features variability on the human scan-rescan data, with optimal pipelines and embedded automated quality control resulting in <5% failures. Specific Objective 2: to develop and validate a) nonlinear high-dimensional models; b) quantum classification techniques; and c) an unsupervised learning framework for phenotype identification from large-scale datasets, for the generation of a novel high-dimensional analysis framework. The targeted performance is classification of subjects according to multi-modality phenotypes with higher accuracy than previous approaches. We will base these efforts on our medical data warehouse comprised of more than 2,404 subjects 20 to 96 years of age, translating to more than 6,000 individual MRI datasets and accompanying clinical/cognitive estimates.  We know of no other database of this magnitude in the world. With potential for multiple graduate-level projects, this multidisciplinary science and engineering research program strongly benefits the training of HQP. Its successful completion will provide a framework for the analysis, data mining and classification of massive, high-dimensional data, increasing the performance of computer aid to diagnosis in AD.

"The enzyme citrate synthase plays a central role in the production of metabolic energy in almost all organisms.  In most organisms, including humans, the enzyme catalyzes its reaction as quickly as possible, with no braking mechanism as long as the raw materials are available.  In one large class of bacteria, the Gram-negative bacteria, the situation is more complex: under certain conditions, it can be inhibited (shut down completely) by a biological reducing agent, NADH.  To make this regulation possible, Gram-negative citrate synthase has evolved to a larger enzyme which can exist in either an active form, or in a second form which interacts with NADH and is inactive.  We have been able to use the method of X-ray crystallography to determine the complete structure of Gram-negative citrate synthase in the NADH-binding or inactive form.  In the present research, we wish to use molecular biology methods to force this enzyme into the active form, and determine that structure.  Our second aim is to exploit the fact that Gra-negative citrate synthase can be turned off, while the human enzyme cannot, to design new antimicrobial drugs.  Some of the most dangerous bacterial pathogens (like E. coli, involved in some kinds of food and water poisoning, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, involved in lung infections in cystic fibrosis) are Gram-negatives.  We are using high-throughput screening of chemical libraries to identify novel compounds that can inhibit Gram-negative citrate synthase, as NADH does, and then refine these discoveries in the hope of producing antimicrobials that can turn off Gram-negative bacterial growth in the case of infections, while having no effect on the human enzyme.

"The property of chirality or ""handedness"" pervades the world in which we live. The phenomenon of molecular chirality, which refers to molecules that are identical in their connectivity but differ in their spatial arrangements, was first recognized by the Nobel Prize winner van't Hoff in 1874. Since then the phenomenon of molecular chirality has become of significant importance with the realization that molecules can have dramatically different physiological effects depending on their chirality. As such the ability to selectively prepare chiral molecules is therefore currently of pressing importance to chemists. The field of asymmetric catalysis (""Chiral Synthesis using Catalysts"") is making this goal achievable through the use of small quantities of additives known as catalysts which selectively afford either ""handed"" isomer of a desired chiral compound. 

     It is in this vein that the proposed research outlines an innovative approach which combines experimental practice with first principles computational insight. As such, proposed is an in silico assisted invention of efficient ""one-pot"" asymmetric Sequential Tandem Catalysis (STC) and Concurrent Tandem Catalysis (CTC) protocols which allow in practice, and foreseeably will continue to allow, access to a diverse array of optically enriched biologically active heterocycles.

     Regarding the latter, the proposed STC- and CTC-methodologies are serving as key synthetic transformations within a total synthesis of (+)-spirolaxine methyl ether which is a metabolite of fungus Sporotrichum laxum that possesses inhibitory activity against Helicobacter pylori. To briefly comment the inhibitory activity of (+)-spirolaxine methyl ether is significant in that the presence of H. pylori, which lives beneath the mucus layer of the stomach, is intimately correlated with the development of gastric and duodenal ulcers. It goes without saying that the proposed research will not only contribute to the field of organic synthesis, but as well will have a positive impact on humankind's quality of life.

"Securing or monitoring Canada's ports and coastal borders is a complex and difficult task due, in part, the lack of appropriate technology to robustly acquire data in a flexible manner, as well as the challenge of interpreting the data. The AquaNet project will develop autonomous vehicle and sensor network technology to enable a collection of mobile and sessile sensor platforms to monitor near shore environments associated with transportation and/or border security. The AquaNet project addresses distributed sensing of environments that are typically challenging for electronic sensing including underwater, shoreline, wetland and portside environments. The project uses a combination of moving robots, fixed sensors, and interactions between them. These are technologies that are essential to provide safety and security for transportation and similar infrastructure. The AquaNet project will conduct pure and applied research into the development of heterogeneous robot sensor networks to monitor shallow aquatic environments, wetlands, ports and related terrains. The project will explore issues related to communication, sensing and planning for a collection of autonomous agents operating in shallow aquatic and near shore terrestrial environments.

The scientific questions addressed within the AquaNet project relate to how to deploy and combination of different sensors to accomplish specific sensing goals. These goals may change over time, and while at one time low fidelity vibration sensing may serve a region well, at a later time more complete visual sensing maybe necessary. This project addresses how an where to place sensors, how to deploy moving robotic systems to complement and monitor them, and how to build models from the resulting data. The project partners include security technology developers, robotics developers and end users who hope to jointly develop solutions of common benefit.","Computer software","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Safety and Security"
"This proposal deals with 

acquiring and maintaining a description of a large-scale

unknown dynamic environment using a collection of

spatially distributed mobile and immobile sensors.  This is to be examined specifically in the context of underwater and amphibious robotics.



Important research objectives, successively more abstract, are: multiple robot collaborative task execution, modeling and summarization of large navigation histories (particularly for

human consumption and analysis),

robust vision-based robot navigation and exploration over large unstructured environments,

approaches to re-generating apparently complete descriptions of an 

environment from partial models,

the development of a

a coherent theoretical framework for both metric and non-metric 

exploration and spatial representation.



As a key concrete example and application, the questions I 

propose to examine are how an amphibious vehicle can build descriptions 

of its environment, navigate over and record the flora and fauna on a coral reef, plan its 

activities (including recovery from surprising events), and interact with humans and other computational 

agents in its immediate vicinity.  This is an application domain with genuine significance

and real challenges.  Moreover, it necessitates scientific innovation in order to handle the

rich and variable context.  Until refcently, it could be argued that neither our scientific not

our engineering skills we up to this challange.

With the maturation of robotics as a field, large changes are 

taking place in our understanding of the key principles of the field, and in how they can be applied.  

This suggests that there is an exceptional potential to contribute to, and influence, the development 

of this discipline as it crystallizes.

"Over the last forty years the manufacturing of electronic circuits has achieved enormous speedups for their devices. The number of gates on a chip has been doubled approximately every two years. It is clear that such an exponential growth can not be sustained indefinitely. The physical boundaries of the miniaturization will be reached in the near future. However, the demand for more computing power is still increasing and there are no indications that this trend will not continue. An analogous trend can be seen in the increase in low power devices (such as cell phones) where the computing power is not the primary concern-power consumption is a more critical factor. 

It has been shown that the loss of information consumes energy. To achieve computations with no power loss, the process must be reversible. It is not surprising that reversible logic has gained interest in recent years. Quantum computation is gaining attention, because some problems can be solved more efficiently in the quantum domain, then with traditional computers. All quantum operations are by necessity reversible. Therefore, quantum computations will benefit from new research results in reversible logic. The proposed research project will advance the theory of reversible logic. Applications for the new results will be found in emerging nanotechnologies as well as in low power devices and quantum computations.

Our focus is primarily on pretreatment and on fermentation of inhibitory mixed sugar substrates.  Ultimately, the goal is to incrementally improve the unit operations such that the overall economics of the process become viable. Within this overall objective, we have a number of specific objectives, namely to: (1) Improve our understanding of the role of lignin as an inhibitor of enzymatic hydrolysis, (2) to further develop oxygen delignification as a pretreatment for enzymatic hydrolysis, by extending the reaction conditions and through the use of catalysts, (3) to extend substrate evaluated to include recycled fibre and mixed urban lignocellulosics, (4) to develop conditions whereby hydrolysates can be readily and quantitatively fermented to ethanol.

"With the collapse of the cod fisheries off the east coast of Canada in the late 1990's, there has been interest recently in intensive culturing of Atlantic Cod in Canada. Farming of cod is of particular significance because of consumer interest and the potential market profit. However, as with any new ""farming"" endeavour, parasites pose serious risks to successful fish cultivation. The current application deals with a parasite that is limiting the production potential of Atlantic cod, a new species to aquaculture. The parasite occurs naturally in wild cod off of the coast of Atlantic Canada.  However, the relatively high stocking densities in confined aquaculture sites lead to heavy parasite infections that cause impaired growth and high mortality in farmed cod. We recently developed a test to diagnose this parasite in cod.  This test will be modified in order to identify specific genetic lines (""families"") of cod that show natural resistance to this parasite.  We have adopted a multifaceted approach towards the goals of limiting parasite transmission to cod at aquaculture sites, identifying genetically resistant families for selection and use in breeding programs, identifying drugs that can block or eliminate parasite infections, and testing methods to vaccinate cod and prevent parasite infections. This project involves translational research to enable technology transfer to an important Canadian Industry. Success with our objectives will undoubtedly enhance productivity of cod aquaculture operations for additional economic diversity and economic gain in Canada. Improvements to production capacity in this industry will result in expansion of operations and additional employment in this sector of the economy. Our project will train researchers in an area of priority towards establishing a significant aquaculture industry in Canada. Aquaculture specialists and infectious disease specialists are integral to Canada's future successes in this target area for benefit to Canada's economy, preservation of native species in the ocean environment (wild cod), and contributions to food demands in global society.

"Parasitic nematodes cause chronic and disabling disease in approximately 4 billion people worldwide. In addition, parasitic nematodes are responsible for substantial livestock production losses throughout the world. Eradication of such parasitic diseases remains a major challenge. Anti-parasite drugs are ineffective against some species and many other parasites have now developed drug resistance. Evolution of the host-parasite relationship is a fascinating subject of study. The host immune system functions to elicit the evolutionary derived response that is most effective in combating the parasite and minimizing damage to the host. However, parasites have evolved their own interesting methods for evading the immune response of their host in order to survive and reproduce. My interests in host-parasite interactions focus on parasite molecules that are released during infective processes to facilitate parasitism. The precise mechanisms and molecules involved are largely unknown at present. This research program is investigating molecules with putative functions in: 1) mimicry - parasites decorate themselves with host molecules to thereby avoid detection by the immune system; 2) infective processes - molecules produced by parasites only during the period of entry into a new host; and, 3) transmission - molecules that appear to be produced to promote parasite release from their host to facilitate infection of new hosts.  Understanding the molecular interactions at the interface of host-parasite relationships provides insight into the mechanisms that parasites use for immune modulation and immune evasion to promote parasite entry into a host, survival within a host, and transmission from a host. My research address basic questions on the biology of parasitic nematodes with the ultimate goal of broader contributions towards development of contemporary methods for prevention of parasitic infection and disease. This research program is of fundamental importance to understanding infective processes and the molecular mechanisms that are involved in parasitism.

"The objective of the research is to develop a generic tool that uses eyetracking and physiological measures to analyze the cognitive and emotional state of users as they interact with a computer system. The system will analyze the incoming signals in terms of attention, interest, cognitive load, linked to a series of zones and actions in the interface. In parallel it will assess the emotional reactions from the physiological measures (stress, excitement). All this should then be linked to a structure of tasks, where zones and interaction actions are specified.  Thus the information from the interaction, the eye tracking and physiological measures, will be interpreted and could be visualized in terms of cognitive and emotional reactions following the structure of tasks and elements of the interfaces. The data accumulated and its analysis will make it possible to assess the quality of the interfaces and of the prescribed interaction, as well as elements, which appear disruptive or preferred along the way. The system will make it possible to study the impact of individual or contextual factors which may affect the interaction, like experience, fatigue, cognitive dimensions or preferences.

The generic system will be developed in collaboration with Bell Canada for the evaluation of web solutions in ecommerce, in order to assess systems before they are put online. It will also be developed in collaboration with the Canadian Space Agency for the assessment of cognitive abilities of Robotics Operators, who use a simulation. The agency is interested to have a better assessment of operators readiness and cognitive abilities, in relation to training or context (fatigue, stress). Different experiments will be carried out to extend and validate the system for different contextual and individual parameters, to assess its validity and usability to support research in Human Computer Interaction.

Such a system is highly innovative, since eye tracking and emotion recognition just start to be used in the context of emarketing and learning environments, but they are rarely used together or with a plan recognition structure, which is essential to assess systems for complex tasks.

"Funds are requested for the initiation of a research program with a long term goal of understanding the mechanisms of nutritional regulation of female reproductive efficiency, with emphasis on ovarian mechanisms. The link between nutritional or metabolic status and reproductive success has long been recognized. From both farm animal and human perspectives, there is a pressing need to understand the mechanisms by which metabolic status of the body affects female reproductive efficiency. The ovarian regulation takes center stage because oocyte, the most significant entity of the process of reproduction, attains maturity to be fertilized within specialized ovarian structures called follicles. Bidirectional communication between oocytes and the surrounding somatic cells known as granulosa cells underpins the process of oocyte maturation and fertility. The overall objectives of the proposed program are: 1. To explore the effects of metabolic hormone signaling on the granulosa cells; 2. to explore the short- and long-term effects of metabolic signaling on a) ovarian follicular dynamics; and b) intracellular metabolic sensor molecules of granulosa cells. For the first objective, we will develop mouse models with granulosa-specific deletion of genes encoding receptors for insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 and leptin. The KO mice will be analyzed for altered reproductive efficiency and granulosa cell gene expression pattern during follicular growth and ovulation. For the second objective we will use swine model maintained at normal, low and high plane of nutrition. Their ovarian dynamics will be monitored by transrectal ultrasonography through at least four reproductive cycles. This approach enables us to study both short-term and long-term effects of metabolic signaling to the ovary. Over all, the proposed research program uses multi-species and multi-disciplinary approaches to link body metabolic status to ovarian function.

"Lake-ice cover has been shown to be a robust indicator of climate variability and change. Recent studies have demonstrated that break-up dates, in particular, have been occurring earlier in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) over the last 50 years in response to warmer climatic conditions in the winter and spring seasons. Break-up dates, and to a lesser extent freeze-up dates, have been shown to be strongly related to the variability and trends in the 0oC isotherm dates as well as large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns (teleconnections), particularly in western North America. The impacts of recently documented trends in air temperature and winter precipitation over the last five decades and those projected by global climate models could be significant on the timing, duration, thickness, and composition of ice cover at northern latitudes. This could, in turn, have an important effect on energy, water and biogeochemical cycling, and aquatic ecosystems in various regions of the NH. How lake-ice cover has changed over the last five decades, and what will likely be the impacts of projected 21st century climate warming on ice cover for lakes of various depths in different regions of the NH are questions that must be examined in order to gain a deeper understanding of climate-lake interactions at northern latitudes. The proposed research program will seek to answer these pressing questions. The overall goal will be to provide a NH synthesis of the temporal and spatial variability and trends in lake ice cover in relation to teleconnection patterns during the second half of the 20th century, and plausible scenarios of the response of lake ice cover to projected future climate conditions. Results from this research will contribute critical data and information during the International Polar Year (IPY) period as well as to international climate change programs (e.g. Climate and Cryosphere (CliC), Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), Integrated Global Observing System (IGOS) - Cryosphere) and assessments such as the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).","Climate and atmosphere","Environmental Earth Sciences"

"This proposal is to characterize the associative and binding strength of a series of dispersants made from PIBSA.  PIBSA are polyisobutylene chains (PIB) terminated at one end with succinic anhydride (SA).  The PIBSA-based dispersants used by the oil-additive industry are obtained by reacting PIBSA with a polyamine.  The PIB moiety of the dispersant likes the oil whereas the polyamine moiety does not.  In the oil, the dispersants can either associate via their polyamine core into dispersant aggregates referred to as micelles, or bind onto carbon-rich particles generated by the engine.  The polyamine core of the PIBSA-based dispersants will be modified with a cyclic carbonate or boric acid to further adjust their associative properties.  The associative strength of the modified dispersants will be estimated from their critical micelle concentration determined by fluorescence measurements.  Their binding onto carbon-rich particles will be described with a Langmuir isotherm.  The competition existing between the association of the dispersants into micelles and their binding onto the polar surface of carbon-rich particles will be investigated.  The correlation between the binding and associative strength of the dispersants will be established.  The basic knowledge learned from these experiments will benefit Imperial Oil, a Canadian company selling PIBSA-based oil-additives used in oil formulations.

"Proteins are chains made of units called amino acids.  Proteins are of interest to scientists because they conduct a number of key processes that enable the body to function.  They achieve these tasks thanks to the tight and compact structure they fold into. A lot of research is done trying to characterize the structure of proteins and many protein structures are now known.  Furthermore, since the human genome has been deciphered, the composition of all human proteins is known.  In other words, the starting point (protein composition) and the end-point (protein structure) are known, but very little is actually known on how a protein chain goes from start to finish.  This proposal aims at mapping out the folding process of proteins by using fluorescently labeled polypeptides.  Polypeptides are long chains made of amino acids which are used as protein mimics.  In solution, polypeptides undergo internal motions which can be probed by fluorescence.  In particular, fluorescence experiments can provide information on how far a single amino acid labeled with a fluorophore moves within the volume defined by the chain in solution.  The fluorescently labeled polypeptides take advantage of the internal watch inherently built with any fluorophore.  As a matter of fact, a fluorophore is excited for a well-defined period of time which is determined by its lifetime.  The lifetime of any fluorophore can be adjusted by addition of an external quencher.  Since a fluorescence experiment reports solely on those fluorophores that are excited, and since experimental means are available to control the time fluorophores remain excited for, the volume probed by a labeled amino acid will be monitored as a function of time.  This study will probe the mobility of amino acids  in solution and provide information on how far an amino acid can move within the volume of the polypeptide coil as a function of time.  These experiments are expected to provide useful experimental data that can be used to model how a protein chain folds in solution.

"This Discovery grant application has been submitted to secure funding to support a research program that will determine if insulin can influence muscle contractility in cardiac as well as skeletal muscles by directly altering the functional characteristics of calcium-transport proteins. Although cardiac and skeletal muscles are similar in many aspects, these tissues have several metabolic and molecular adaptations that make each tissue unique. For example, the type of calcium-transport proteins that are found in the heart are different than the calcium-transport proteins found in skeletal muscles. Since calcium is an important molecule that causes muscle to contract, it is important that calcium-transport proteins work properly to allow our muscles to perform the smooth movements required for physical activity. Insulin is most commonly known to regulate blood sugar in humans. However, some scientists have shown that insulin signaling can also influence muscle contractility. One mechanism to explain this effect is associated with the fact that insulin signaling proteins directly interact with calcium-transport proteins in muscle. This proposal seeks to build upon these interesting observations by determining if similar effects can be seen using models that include cultured heart and muscle cells, isolated rat hearts and muscles, or in human skeletal muscle. Data emerging from this research program will advance our understanding of factors that regulate muscle contractility and will generate new knowledge regarding processes that influence calcium transport processes in muscle. If this application is successful, the funding will ensure that my emerging research program has the operating funds to conduct cutting edge experiments looking at the influence insulin exerts on the processes that regulate contractility in the heart as well as in skeletal muscle. It will also financially support students training in my laboratory so they can become the next generation of leading scientists.

"I am at the forefront of a subdiscipline that integrates evolutionary biology with animal cognition, defined as the set of traits concerned with the acquisition, retention, and use of information. Work in this subdiscipline has successfully changed traditional thinking in biology and psychology. There are three major ongoing projects in my lab. First, we evaluate the relative effect of learning on performance throughout the lifespan. This work, which is the only empirical research program on that important topic, is highly relevant to all species, with potential policy implications in humans. Second, we quantify the adaptive significance of learning in fruit flies and the effects such learning has on assortative mating and incipient speciation. This work has contributed to two fundamental basic-science questions regarding the evolution of learning and the generation of new species through behaviour. Finally, we are commencing a new project examining the role of social learning in fruit flies. Social learning is currently known from some vertebrates and social insects. Examining the origins of social learning can help us understand a fundamental characteristic underlying modern humans and culture.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Evolution & Ecology"

"Rapid global change poses significant scientific challenges for evolutionary ecologists. Biodiversity underpins our life support; providing the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat and much more. The wealth of these ecosystem services is depreciating rapidly as human populations expand, prosper and change the face of the globe. Coastal oceans comprise only 18% of the Earth's surface yet support half the world's fish biodiversity and provide more than half of global primary production, global denitrification and carbonate deposition and most of the global fisheries catch. My proposal targets three fundamental questions directly related to the impacts of global change on current and future sustainability of coastal oceans. Overfishing and increasingly climate change are the main drivers of population decline, extinction, invasions and habitat loss. My proposal directly addresses three big questions relevant to understanding the causes and consequences of biodiversity change at large spatial scales. (1) The overwhelming majority of species remain unknown, given the paucity of knowledge can we use life history theory and the links between life histories and extinction risk to prioritize potentially vulnerable species, specifically sharks and rays, for assessment and conservation? (2) Climate change has brought forward springtime, advancing the flowering of plants and blooming of phytoplankton by several weeks. What are the population consequences of the potential mismatch between the timing, intensity and duration of marine plankton blooms for the survival of marine fish larvae and which fish life history strategies are most vulnerable to climate mismatching? (3) How can we predict the effects of fishing and climate change on species richness at ecosystem-scales, especially since the majority of species remain unknown to science? I will address these questions using comparative 'meta-analysis' of global compilations of information from libraries, fisheries agencies and ocean-observing satellites combined with local-scale analyses of food web structure and function in three ecosystems: British Columbia intertidal shores and adjacent kelp forests, BC central coast salmon streams and Fijian coral reefs.

"Our first research interest is the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders during pregnancy, particularly back pain. During pregnancy, the loads on the spine increase because of the increased body mass, and the shift forward of the trunk centre of mass. Pregnant women may also need to adopt different working postures because of the increased size of the abdomen (for example to reach), and this may cause discomfort and pain if the postures are prolonged. There is still little scientific evidence on which to base decisions on job adjustment, and more research is needed to better understand the interactions between the biomechanical changes of pregnancy and the work environment.  We have developed methods to analyse specific tasks performed by pregnant women in the lab or in the field. In the next five years, we will continue to develop relevant research tools to analyse  tasks. We will also analyse tasks identified as problematic for pregnant women in the Canadian context (pushing a heavy trolley, computer work) and in the African context (carrying loads on the head). These methods will be used primarily for pregnancy studies but will be available for the study of other populations as well. 

A second research interest is in developing models that can simulate the effect of various factors on bone properties.  ""Quality of bone"" is a key factor in preventing fractures and in their successful treatment. It is influenced by the strength of the bone tissue and by bone internal structure. These two aspects will be investigated experimentally and combined in the models to be developed.

"The goal of this research is to improve our knowledge of the dynamics in the Earth's fluid core and its interaction with the inner core and mantle.  Though the physics describing these systems is complex, progress can be made by focusing on specific aspects of the dynamics.  The general approach in this research is to test simple models of the dynamics by investigating whether the predicted variations in the Earth's magnetic field, rotation and gravity field are compatible with actual observations of these quantities. Specific dynamical aspects of the Earth's core that are studied include torsional oscillations, a core flow with a cylindrical geometry detected in the magnetic data and the Earth's rotation variations.  Questions remain as to whether these oscillations are free modes, like a mass suspended by a spring, or forced motions by the underlying dynamics.  I will study the nature of this flow by numerical modelling. Another project is to investigate the cause of the so-called ""geomagnetic jerks"",  which are magnetic variations occurring on a timescale of approximately 1 year.  I propose to study the action between flows and magnetic field near the surface of the core and to test which scenario is most compatible with observations.  Using the same framework, I will also study the cause of the so-called ""archaeomagnetic jerks"", which are observed over a much longer timescale of millennia.  Over the same timescale, archaeomagnetic observations will be surveyed to determine whether the motions of magnetic field features near the equator of the CMB observed over the past few centuries have been a feature of the geodynamo for much longer in the past.  Finally, two projects involve the role of the inner core in the rotational dynamics of the Earth.  First, observed variations in the Earth's rotation rate with a period of 6 years are interpreted to represent axial oscillations between the inner core and mantle.  Gravity field and magnetic field data will be surveyed to find further evidences of this oscillation.  In the second project, I will study the dynamics of the flow and magnetic field near the inner core, through their ability to imprint a torque on the latter which leads to a tilt of its figure and causes a change in the direction of Earth's rotation.

"The advent of modern communications raises new challenges for multimedia transmission. One of these challenges, encountered in both wired and wireless networks, is the necessity to alleviate the impact of packet loss. A paradigm to effectively solve this problem is multiple description coding (MDC). The basic idea in MDC is to create several descriptions of the signal such that the source can be reconstructed to a certain fidelity from each individual description, and when more descriptions are available, they can refine each other, leading to a higher fidelity reconstruction.



The main objective of the proposed research is the development of efficient algorithms for the design of optimal multiple description codes. The emphasis will be on two approaches for MDC: multiple description scalar quantization and uneven erasure protected packetization of scalable codestreams. Beside developing new

solutions (faster and/or of higher accuracy) to previously formulated optimization problems, the applicant will investigate new MDC frameworks and will propose solutions to new problems raised from practical concerns.



The proposed research will lead to new techniques for robust multimedia transmission over lossy networks, which more efficiently use the available resources in transmission rate. These techniques will be directly applicable in practice. Additionally, this research will bring new insights in the area of MDC design, thus contributing to the advancement of knowledge and understanding in the area and laying background for further research.

"One of the most remarkable findings in pain research is the discovery that the brain can alter the sensitivity to noxious stimuli in the periphery. This explains how various psychological states can alter nociceptive thresholds and ultimately, the pain experience itself. For example, the same noxious stimulus can provoke different responses when experienced under different emotional conditions. It is now well documented that anxiety or stress can amplify the physical sensation of pain, sensitize nociceptive pathways and thereby, contribute to the development of pathophysiological pain states.

     However, an understanding of the actual neurobiological mechanisms through which this occurs lags far behind the description of the phenomenon. This project is the initial step towards a long-term research program aimed at identifying the neurobiological mechanisms through which emotions can alter nociceptive sensitivity and hence, the pain experience. We focus on the neurophysiology of the Bed nucleus of the Stria Terminalis (BST), a structure within the brain limbic (emotional) system that may contribute to the emotional modulation of nociception and pain. Using a combination of behavioral, anatomical, and electrophysiological methods, the objective of this specific project is to characterize the response of BST neurons to harmful or potentially harmful stimuli.

     This project will involve the training of several graduate and undergraduate students that will contribute, under my direct supervision, to the advancement of knowledge in the neurophysiology of nociception and pain. These students will acquire specialized knowledge and gain experience with cutting-edge techniques before becoming our future scientific leaders focused on improving the treatment and management of pain. This research will benefit Canadians by improving the health and quality of life of individuals (and their families) affected by pathological pain states and hopefully, will help to reduce the huge economic burden brought on by such conditions.

"Computer controlled, or automatic, drug delivery is the process of administering a therapeutic regime to a patient with computer assistance for calculation of optimal dose and delivery schedules. Computer control can improve drug therapy by reducing drug usage and costs, by permitting health care staff to work more efficiently and to provide better standard of care, by allowing the safe use of drugs that are difficult to administer, and by compensation for human failings with computer strengths, such as unlimited attention span and patience, and capacity for quick, accurate and redundant calculation. Our goal is to develop an automatic control system for anesthesia and to demonstrate its efficacy, safety and benefits in an operating room. We will concentrate on neuromuscular blockade (NMB) drugs because of their relative absence of toxicity, other than that associated with its desired effect, paralysis. NMB drugs produce paralysis in surgeries, permitting surgeons to make smaller incisions, providing access to deep anatomical structures otherwise hindered by unconscious muscle action and facilitating intubation of the trachea. Once the methods and algorithms involved in computer control for NMB are proven to be safe, effective and robust to patient variance for the relatively safe NMB drugs, the system will be adapted for intra-venous anesthetics and analgesics and vapour anesthetics. In no way will the proposed system replace the anesthesiolohist, but rather just like an autopilot does for a pilot, the proposed system will extend the anesthesiologist's abilities and improve patient safety and quality of care.","Medical and health sciences","Collaborative Health Research Projects Selection Panel"

"Standard web search engines might find web pages that describe biochemicals, but they have little capability in finding biochemicals with a specific set of properties. The reason for this is that biochemical information on the web is not represented in a machine understandable format, and as such, cannot be queried in a complex manner. If biochemicals were represented using a formal knowledge representation language such as description logics, then we could use computers to reason about the information and infer knowledge that is explicit in our shared conceptualization, i.e. a biochemical ontology.



This proposal aims to capture the semantics of biochemical structure such that computer-based inferences about function become possible. The approach involves the design of biochemical ontologies and the development of a reasoning-capable knowledge base. The expected outcomes are that chemical functional groups may be inferred from structure and biochemical compounds may be automatically classified. This semantic framework will provide biochemists with the ability to query at variable levels of granularity of chemical structure (electron, atom, molecule) and function (functional groups, organic compounds). 



This research has the potential to form a cornerstone of the newly emerging semantic web so as to provide biochemical knowledge in a format that is amenable to computer-based reasoning. We anticipate that our efforts to model spatial and temporal aspects of chemical structure will facilitate the querying of complex data such as that generated from molecular dynamics simulations.  In combination with other complimentary efforts, we expect that new semantic links may be formed with our resource, leading to improved data integration and powerful new data mining opportunities over heterogeneous biochemical knowledge.

"More and more, human has to talk with computers. It follows an economic reality. Sometimes, the communication is defective. This type of lack of communication is frustrating for both the client andthe industry. It also jeopardizes the good relation with the client. Bell Canada would like to study this problem in a context of call center.



The objective of this project is to enhance Human-Computer (H-C) dialog systems for call centers. Enhancements will be explored in two ways. First, we propose to classify H-C dialogs as problematic or successful. This task will serve to track unsatisfied customer by predicting their satisfaction given the H-C dialog. Second, we propose to automatically monitor a customer dialog in order to track problematic situations where negative emotions are detected during the dialog. This task will allow on-the-fly the redirection of an unsatisfied customer to an agent for assistance. The focus of our work will be in combining multi-knowledge sources including prosodic, linguistic and paralinguistic features and in using learning techniques. This research project will be studied in the setting of telephone call centers in collaboration with our industrial partner Bell Canada.

Emotion detection from speech could also serve as pragmatic information in another context of a telecommunication systems. For example, the emotion detector output could be used as an add-on in a Deaf's Voice Relay System (telephone system used by the deaf community) or as information for managing Human-Computer (H-C) dialogs in a context of call centers. 



This project will concentrate on the multimedia application of emotion detection. The short term objective for this project is to develop and test algorithms able to detect automatically the emotion from the speech in a context of TV shows and movies. The long term objective will be to explore the integration of this type of detector for other domains of application such as H-C interface.

"Research on thinking and reasoning has made tremendous progress over the last decade with much research on the neural, computational, and underlying cognitive mechanisms involved in analogical, causal, categorical and creative thinking. Using fMRI, researchers have discovered a number of key sites involved in analogical, causal, and creative thinking. Unfortunately it is still difficult to determine the order in which different regions are activated and to use tasks in which participants move or speak.  An alternative to fMRI is functional Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (fNIRS) in which arrays of light emitting diodes are placed on the head that monitor the amount of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. fNIRS provides much faster temporal resolution than fMRI yet records the same type of information.  Furthermore spatial resolution of fNIRS is particularly sensitive in regions involved in higher level cognition Thus NIRS is ideal for propose to do is determine the order of activation of these sites that will allow us to formulate a process model of analogical thinking.  In addition, categorical thinking plays an important role in the model and we will also conduct experiments on the time course of categorical thinking, particularly the interaction of the temporal cortex and the DLPFC. This will allow us to distinguish between different models of reasoning and provide a more complete account of analogical and creative thought that was not possible using other methods The results of this work will make it possible to benefit  reasoning in science, literature, ands discourse.

"How typical is our Solar System? The issue of how planetary systems form and dynamically evolve is one of the oldest unsolved problems in astronomy. In the past decade, remarkable observational clues have been found including i) thousands of icy bodies in vast reservoirs beyond Neptune, ii) numerous planet-forming disks of gas and dust around newly forming stars and iii) hundreds of unusual planetary systems around many nearby mature stars.  These discoveries challenge many aspects of what had become the ""standard model"" of planet formation, requiring, for example, mechanisms to create the intricately disturbed structure in the cometary region beyond Neptune and to affect not only the eccentricities (""shapes"") of orbits but to induce spiralling inward or outward of planets in our own system and those around other stars.  It is still widely believed, however, that the cores of most planets are formed from the accumulation of much smaller bodies similar to comets and asteroids.  Due to the generally chaotic nature of their dynamics, the most powerful theoretical method for understanding the formation and dynamical evolution of such systems is to construct computer models to numerically follow the orbits of large numbers of gravitationally interacting bodies for millions to billions of years, including the effects of interactions with the gas disk and/or physical collisions among the bodies.  Many of the problems I am studying with my students and collaborators utilize a very efficient computer software package called SWIFT, originally developed by H. Levison (SouthWest Research Institute) and me, and widely used internationally.  We are incorporating a variety of methods to more efficiently model the interaction of  growing planets with a population of smaller bodies and are now poised to tackle pressing problems that have been hitherto computationally intractable.  These include extensive simulations of the formation of giant planets and simulations of the influence on the cometary reservoirs beyond Neptune of the planet-building process and the stellar nursery in which the Sun formed.

"Controlling how cells synthesize proteins from the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that encode these proteins, a process referred to as protein translation, is essential to normal cell function. Quantitative or qualitative differences in the translation of specific mRNAs influence such diverse events as development and control of cell replication. Alternate mechanisms that regulate the initiation of translation can also result in more than one protein being translated from a single species of mRNA, which has major implications on understanding the complexity of cellular proteomes (i.e. how many different proteins your cells can produce). Mutations that alter the control of translation initiation are also associated with several disease states. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate translation initiation, therefore, has broad implications. Although numerous mechanisms for regulating translation initiation have been described, our understanding of these processes remains far from complete. My research group is exploring this area by analyzing an unusual group of viral mRNAs that encode three different proteins from a single mRNA. These studies hold the promise of defining novel mechanisms that regulate cellular protein synthesis.","Advancement of knowledge","Molec. & Develop. Genetics"

With the intensification human activities, such as manufacturing, agriculture, and the growth of municipalities, the risk of increased levels of carcinogen contamination in Canadian rivers and lakes is rising. We propose to develop a rapid test to screen water samples by using antibodies that recognize checkpoint proteins. Checkpoint proteins act as a defense mechanism to preserve genome integrity, and their levels are known to increase quickly when DNA damage occurs. By exposing fish cells to water from potentially contaminated sites, we can monitor the extent to which checkpoint protein levels rise as a consequence of the presence of such carcinogens.

"This project will assess the impact of agricultural management practices on the ecology and function of soil microorganisms.  Recently the Canadian government has targeted increased biofuel production as a way to combat the country's dependence on fossil fuels.  The increased demand for fuel feedstock has challenged the agricultural sector to provide agricultural crops for food, animal grain, as well as biofuels.  Any management practice that alters microbial community structure is a concern because of the potential impact that it could have on plant growth and soil health, and long term soil ecosystem sustainability.  In addition, alterations in activity and biodiversity of these microorganisms may have a cascading impact throughout the soil food web, since bacteria and fungi are known to be at its base.   Certain soil types or climatic regions may be better suited for long term agricultural production of biofuels, however, it is understood that the interaction between soil, plants and climate will influence the composition of the microbial community.  Therefore it is important to begin to understand how spatial and climatic variability influences soil microbial community dynamics.  This project will use molecular techniques to assess the impact of soil tillage, plant type and biomass removal on the soil bacterial, archaeal and mycorrizal communities.  We will target groups associated with C and N cycles including ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB), ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA), denitrifying bacteria, free-living nitrogen fixers, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.   Increasing our understanding of microbial community dynamics may be invaluable to current efforts that are underway to improve models that predict the emission of N2O in agricultural fields, and to predict which soil and climatic regions can most easily sustain biomass removal for biofuel production while maintaining soil health and ecosystem sustainability. This knowledge will ultimately contribute to the development of strategies to combat climate change.

"Methane is a major greenhouse gas and a clean alternative fuel. Bacteria that consume methane as a food source are therefore of great interest to environmental and industrial scientists. These bacteria may be manipulated to reduce atmospheric methane emissions from natural or man-made environments, and thereby reduce global warming. We plan to study the ecology and genetics of methanotrophic (methane-eating) bacteria in some important Canadian ecosystems such as northern wetlands, industrial tailings, and forest soils. We will search for unusual species of these bacteria by recovering their unique DNA sequences directly from the environment. 



My group has recently discovered several new species of methanotrophic bacteria, which are unusual compared to all previously known species. One belongs to an environmentally abundant bacterial phylum (the Verrucomicrobia) that is poorly studied because its members are very difficult to grow in the laboratory. Our species is an extreme acidophile able to grow down to pH 1.5. Another new methanotroph we are studying is uniquely able to change its lifestyle from consuming methane to consuming other environmental substrates. In collaboration with the Joint Genome Institute and the University of Hawaii in the USA, we will sequence the complete genomes of these new and unusual methane-eating bacteria. By comparing the entire sets of genes they possess, we hope to understand in detail how they live in nature and how they might be used in environmentally and industrially useful ways.

"Our research in rock magnetism deals with magnetic mineral grains which act as ""fossil compasses"".  The aim is to obtain records of ancient magnetic fields, for the Earth and other bodies, such as Mars and meteorites.  Both magnetic field intensities and directions are of interest.  The purpose is to understand the core dynamos of the Earth and other planets and plate tectonic motions of continents and seafloor, as well as the microscopic mechanisms by which minerals retain a magnetic memory stable over geological time.  Specific projects include:

  (1)  Magnetic memory of minerals believed to be important in the crusts of Earth and Mars and in meteorites with a view to determining ancient planetary field strengths and validating proposed sources of major magnetic field anomalies at the surfaces of planets.

  (2)  Paleointensity determination: finding the strength of the early Earth's magnetic field.  The Earth's field history strongly constrains theories of cooling of the Earth's core and switching on of the geodynamo.

  (3)  Continued research into the best method(s) of paleointensity determination, bringing together controlled laboratory studies and observations on rocks and sediments.

  (4)  Thermal / chemical remagnetization of rocks and thermal/uplift histories.  Time-dependent magnetization will test whether early life forms could have traveled to Earth aboard Martian meteorites (""exogenesis"").

  (5)  Paleomagnetic field directions recorded in ocean floor rocks and Precambrian shields, tracking the histories of plate collisions and uplift of mountain belts.

  (6)  Magnetic domains observed under the microscope and by electron holography, compared with 3D computer modeling of micromagnetic structure.  The objective is to explain how the magnetic memory of rocks remains stable over geological time.","Earth sciences","Solid Earth Sciences"
"The aim of this research program is to delineate the formation and evolution of the present-day universe of galaxies since the epoch when the first stars and galaxies formed, less than 1 billion years after the Big Bang. 

In particular this work aims to map out the rate at which gas has been converted into stars within galaxies over cosmic history, and the connection between this process and the growth of supermassive black holes in galaxy centres.



Until now this has not been possible due to the lack of infrared and sub-millimetre images of the depth and area required to sample representative volumes of the universe out to the highest redshifts (z ~ 7). Such imaging is crucial to uncover the redshifted optical light from stars in the early universe, and the redshifted far-infrared light produced from dust-obscured star-forming regions in young galaxies.



Now, however, this situation is being transformed by a new generation of wide-field infrared and sub-mm imaging cameras. These are capable of imaging several square degrees of the sky with sufficient depth to detect and study the first galaxies. This research will exploit a series of new ultradeep surveys which will be undertaken with these facilities over the next 5 years, surveys which should completely revolutionize our view of cosmic history.



These new surveys will also enable the discovery and selection of extremely distant galaxies in the young universe for detailed follow-up with the next generation of world-wide astronomical facilities. These include the James Webb Space Telescope and the Atacama Large Millimetre Array, facilties in which Canada is playing a major technological and scientific role.

"The objective of my research is to better understand the nature and duration of mountain-building events, a consequence of plate-tectonics.  This is done by careful mapping of rock units where they are well exposed, such as coastal Newfoundland, followed by examination of their minerals under the microscope, and determination of their ages of crystallization.

     

     To determine the rate at which mountain- building occurs and the rates at which rocks heat up as they are deeply buried, then melt, and then cool down again, radiometric ages are determined for rocks by measuring the amount of lead (Pb) produced by the decay of uranium (U) that is present in certain tiny minerals (zircon, monazite) in the rock.  U/Pb ages of minerals are measured in the radiogenic isotope laboratory in the Department of Earth Sciences at Memorial University, one of only a few such labs in Canada with an extremely low level of background lead contamination.  With very miniaturized chemical processing techniques that can cleanly separate less than 1 millionth of a gram of lead and measure it precisely, we can determine the age of a single zircon crystal less than one tenth of a millimeter in length.

     

     These crystals act as tiny clocks recording the time elapsed since they crystallized from a molten lava, or during a high-temperature heating of deeply buried rocks. With precise ages, which for a geologist is +/-1 million years or less, it is possible to resolve events that happened in quick succession in the development of a mountain range over geological time.

"Most methods of knowledge-discovery and data mining assume parameters outside the observed data such as prior probabilities, belief functions or statistical distributions, the origin of which is not always clear or justifiable. On the other hand, there is a high demand for ""non-invasive"" methods of data analysis (such as rough sets, concept lattices, or knowledge structures) that take into account only the given data without stringent additional model assumptions. Using fewer model assumptions results in more generality, wider applicability, less decontextualization, and reduced costs and time. A powerful tool of non-invasive data analysis is relational reasoning, based on ideas developed by Alfred Tarski in the 1940s and which incorporate both relational and algebraic aspects of reasoning procedures. 



The main aim of my research is to study the algebraic and logical foundations of relational reasoning and to supplement it by statistical and information theoretic methods that enable it to function as a reliable tool of non-invasive data analysis. The main application areas are qualitative temporal and spatial reasoning, theories of visual perception with a particular emphasis on JJ Gibson's work, and the development of structural tools for diagnostic assessment.

"Most of the drugs currently used as therapies (including beta-blockers in heart disease and multiple others) are directed against the largest family of cell surface receptors which transduce signals outside of the cell into activity inside the cell), the seven transmembrane receptors (7TM-Rs). These drugs target the site where endogenous compounds interact with the receptor. Unfortunately, all of these drugs produce significant side effects. This may be in part because the targetting of the ligand binding site is not specific enough to block only the desired effect. This is likely due to the nature of the receptor and how it actually transmits signals inside the cell. Also, it is now known that different receptors can associate together and form a new receptor entity.  Surprisingly, very little attention has been given to the way these receptors form to permit signalling and what brings specificity of signalling. 



We know that each receptor can be coupled to multiple signalling pathways and that specific proteins can regulate the activity of the receptor. How can we make drugs that are more specific and have less side effects? I want to identify the proteins that associate with the new receptor entities (receptor heterodimers) and understand how the protein partners can regulate the signals transmitted inside the cell. Once the partners are known, this will provide researchers new therapeutic targets that will complement current therapies, and possibly reduce drug adverse effects. My group will use a new technology I developped to identify unique and specific heterodimeric receptor partners. The new technique developped is among the first ones to allow specific identification of heterodimeric receptor partners.



Adverse effects of current drugs are probably induced by receptor heterodimers. Understanding the way these receptors work will help reduce drug adverse effects and help researchers develop better therapies.

"The stochastic modeling of extremes is important to many fields. Estimation of the incidence and severity of floods, large winds, large precipitations (rain, snow, or ice), and so on are essential to engineering when many structural designs rely on  data-based methodologies for the estimation of design loads.  Underestimation of probable extreme loads leads to catastrophic structural failure; recall the state of the transmission towers after the Ice Storms.

      This area of modeling is also important in insurance and finance.  Insurance companies face probable large (catastrophic) claims and a company's solvency depends critically on the size and the frequency of large claims. The issue is very real with recent environmental disasters such as Hurricane Andrew, the Mississippi floods, the 1998 Ice Storms, and Hurricane Katrina causing havoc and eventual financial failures in the insurance industry. On the financial markets, large price movements are rare, but important. We recall the October 1987 market drop, and we have yet to find the bottom in the October 2008 drop. Increases in volatility of daily stock market indices have attracted much attention from both practitioners and researchers. Companies (and individuals) have taken on huge losses due to unexpected market moves. We need accurate measures of market and insurance risks and that requires accurate modeling of the distribution of large losses and claims.

      Many agree that there is a lack of practical statistical methodology in this area. Some progress has been made in the last few years: more realistic models accounting for non-stationarity and correlation; modest multivariate models making better use of available data; Bayesian analyses incorporating ''expert'' knowledge; and robust models identifying and downweighting ''small'' extremes (reducing underestimation).  However, there is still a long way to go.  The purpose of the proposed research is to further the progress made by these recent methodologies and develop new methods.

"Radiant Energy Vacuum (REV) is technique for drying heat-sensitive materials very quickly but at low temperatures so as not to damage biological activity. Vacuum is employed to lower the boiling point of water to just above the freezing point or even to far below the freezing point, then microwaves are employed to quickly evaporate the water without raising the temperature to destructive levels. Although based on principles established by others in the past, my research group has spent the last 10 years developing REV into a practical drying technology. My goal is to develop an economical drying method to replace freeze drying for many applications. REV is currently protected by about a dozen patents, most of them owned by The University of British Columbia and these patents have been licensed to a Canadian company whose goal is to commercialize the technology. Today REV is used for drying a few high-value food products such as berries and mushrooms. We have shown that it is able to dry bacteria without killing the cells, as well as to dry several drugs, antibiotics, enzymes and antibodies with little or no damage. We hope to further prove the usefulness of the technology for drying and stabilizing vaccines, probiotic bacteria, and natural antimicrobial agents.","Manufacturing processes and products","Plant Biology & Food Science"

My research examines the process of stress acclimation in photosynthetic organisms. In particular, we are examining the function of the light-harvesting complexes (LHCs), which are pigment-binding proteins in the chloroplasts of plants that comprise what is known as the antenna system.  The antenna system is a complex assembly of many different LHC and LHC-like proteins that have the dual roles of harvesting light to drive photosynthesis and the dissipation of light energy under periods of stress when excess light can be destructive. My laboratory is interested in the compositional and structural changes in the antennae system that occurs in response to changes in environmental conditions. These changes are necessary in order to balance light-harvesting capacity with the utilization of captured energy. We are proposing to investigate a group of proteins that are generally referred to as LHC-like, whose role in photoacclimation and stress responses is unknown but is often associated with protection against light stress. We will examine these proteins by determining their location within the thylakoid membrane system, by assessing their pigment binding capabilities and by using a reverse genetic approach to eliminate the protein from the organism in order to measure the effects on photosynthetic function. Dissecting the mechanisms behind the vital roles of light harvesting and energy dissipation within the antenna system is important to predict the capacity of plants to tolerate increased stress conditions.

"For more than a decade, our group has been making synthetic photoconductors and semiconductors aimed at being used in the photoscience based technology.We are seeking new ways to use photoinduced electron transfer chemistry to make new photoactive and electroactive materials.Our research program is guided by the following questions:  

What fundamental factors control the electronic properties observed on molecular and polymeric organic semiconductors and their charge transport in solution and in the solid state?

 How can these factors be manipulated to obtain new useful products?

 How can the new knowledge be used to develop material and devices such as organic field-effect transistors and photovoltaic (solar) cells?

Our group of reseachers are employing a combination of spectroscopic techniques and theoretical approaches to gain a quantitative understanding of the relationship that exists between the conformation of an oligomer and its spectral properties. This understanding will guide the development of more efficient light-driven transistors and solar cells.  These optical effects are driven by a delicate balance between repulsive intrachain steric interactions and attractive interchain interactions (agregation).The agregation of these oligomers will be studied in solutions (mixtures of good/bad solvents) and as films. A systematic picture of the relationship between agregate structure and electronic properties will emerge from these studies. 

These fundamental studies have profound technological relevance.  Indeed, these materials have already been used in the development of new devices in micro-electronics, in electrochromic materials and in electroluminescent diodes and sensors.

"SUMMARY. Large-scale transfection of HEK293 (293) and CHO cells is becoming an established technology to rapidly produce milligram to gram quantities of biologically active recombinant proteins in less than 2 weeks following cDNA cloning into the expression plasmid. However, this technology still suffers from significant limitations in terms of transfection efficiency and volumetric productivity. For example, while stable CHO cell line can generate 1-3 grams per liter quantities of monoclonal antibodies, the best yields reported for transient expression are in the 100-300 mg/L range. Improving the titers of the transient expression technology will make it useable for the generation of clinical grade material. This research program aims at better understanding the transfection process and improving the technology by tackling the main barriers to an efficient transfection through three approaches: 1- Understanding and maximizing cellular uptake of plasmid DNA: Members of the cell-surface heparan sulphate proteoglycan family will be evaluated for their ability to offer transfection-effective polyplex binding sites at the cell surface. 2- Increasing nuclear targeting of plasmid DNA: Polyplex will be decorated with ligands targeting cell-surface receptors known to undergo nuclear translocation following activation. Another approach will be to decorate polyplexes with nuclear localisation sequence. 3- Improving endosomal escape of plasmid DNA: Polyplex will be decorated with fusogenic peptides or viral proteins that promote endosome escape, one of the major limiting step in transfection. The ultimate goal of this research project aim at developing a robust and cost-effective large-scale transfection process for accelerating biotherapeutic discovery and development.","Manufacturing processes and products","Cell Biology"

(2) We have identified the very active anti-herpes/anti-biotic component found in the ethyl extracts of algae harvested on the shores of Ungava Bay in Northern Quebec as a glycolipid built from galactose, glycerol and ?-linolenic acid.

The semi-purified extract has activity comparable to that of the currently used anti-epileptic drug in Canada using the GABA-T bio-assay. Assuming that the structure is not overly complex we will initiate studies towards its synthesis and the synthesis of analogs.

"Evolution and spread of infectious disease is the result of molecular- and individual-level interactions that play out at the level of populations, regions, or the whole globe.  Mathematical theory and dynamical modeling are the key tools for understanding the links between these scales.  Modeling of infectious disease has been a tremendously productive field, providing both general insights into population dynamics and evolutionary processes, and specific insight into understanding and combatting diseases with important implications for human health, agriculture and conservation biology.



Infectious diseases continue to have great practical importance, and to provide the potential for learning about biological systems. The amount of genomic, biochemical and epidemiological information about pathogenic organisms and host-pathogen interactions is increasing rapidly.  My research program aims to develop new theoretical and computational tools for using this information, and for integrating different kinds of information, to build better basic and practical understanding of the evolution and spread of disease organisms, including human influenza A viruses, canine rabies, and mammalian malaria, among others.

commercially viability. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA), as it is now referred, has the potential to

reduce environmental impact of fish-farming, bring greater social acceptance to fish farming practices, while

resulting in economic diversification through additional products. Although the methods have been primarily

operating costs of marine land-based systems are significantly higher than the open-cage systems commonly

used for salmon farming. Consequently, to be economically viable, all aspects of the production cycle must be

energy efficient, and production must be focused on high value products. Over the past decade, Scotian Halibut

Ltd. have developed the World's only land-based operation for growing Atlantic halibut, a high-quality product

that commands the high price. Over the next decade, the company vision is to diversify, and improve the

efficiency of its operations by integrating marine plant culture into its business plan. By culturing specific

red-algae within the recirculation system, the algae will convert the waste nutrients, primarily Nitrates and

"Soft materials, such as polymers, biopolymers, liquid crystals and foods, are all around us and we rely on them routinely in our everyday life. They are called ""soft"" because the bonding between the molecules and between aggregates of molecules is generally quite weak. As a result, they are very responsive to changes in their environment, such as changes in temperature and pH. Soft materials are also complex in their structure, which is typically hierarchical in which the structure on one length scale is built on many underlying levels of structure down to the nanoscale level. The dynamic response is similarly complex, ranging from picoseconds, corresponding to the motion of individual segments of macromolecules, to what might be called ""human"" time scales of seconds, minutes and years, corresponding to the slow flow or creep of soft materials or physical ageing. The responsiveness and complexity of soft materials pose fascinating challenges to understand the underlying mechanisms of their complex behavior, and offer exciting opportunities to design and exploit these materials for new applications.



In our research, we want to understand the properties of soft materials at surfaces, which are ubiquitous throughout Nature. Our work focuses on addressing questions such as: What are the effects of an interface and changes in the environment on the conformation of biopolymers? What are the structure and mechanical properties of naturally-occurring, nanostructured biomaterials? How do bacteria stick to surfaces? What is the effectiveness and mechanism of action of novel antimicrobial compounds? We will use a wide range of state-of-the-art, surface-sensitive tools and a materials physics perspective to probe these questions in detail. We hope that this will lead to an understanding of the underlying mechanisms for their behavior, and to the discovery of new materials and strategies for designing and applying soft materials in new applications.

"Aspect-oriented programming (AOP), an active research area, is interested in modularizing program features, including synchronization, distribution, and instrumentation, all of which crosscut and entangle with more fundamental application concerns.  By encapsulating and abstracting these features, programs can become easier to write, read, and maintain.  One fundamental form of AOP modularizes these features by a novel mechanism comprised of three parts: dynamic join points, pointcuts, and advice.  Existing semantic accounts of this mechanism are disconnected from AOP's goal of modular separation of concerns because the account imposes an ad-hoc extension to a base language.



Based on doctoral research showing that dynamic join points arise naturally from the continuation semantics of a programming language, this research proposes a bridge between the modularity goals of AOP and the semantic structures it works with.  That bridge identifies dynamic join point aspects as modularizing control structure of programs.  In the short term, a number of projects are proposed to refine and extend this model of AOP, especially focusing on types and effects descriptions of the modular units made available by AOP.  By identifying and annotating these ""abstract control types"" in programs, we enable a fuller account of the programmers intentions and provide ways for those intentions to be checked against the actual program code.  This clarity and checking should result in fewer software defects, and possibly greater code reuse.



In the long term, this research programme proposes to develop a ""standard model of programming languages"" which characterizes the elements and interactions at work in programming languages.  This modularity over control is the first part of that model.

"""Decarbonizing"" energy supply is a technological solution to address global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and in this context the idea of ""hydrogen energy economy"" has significant merit. The major challenge in moving towards a hydrogen (H2) economy is to produce sufficient H2 economically, sustainably, and environment-friendly to meet future demand. At present, 96% of the total H2 production is sourced from fossil fuels. Biomass with a total annual production of about 8 times the total world energy consumption, represents an immense and renewable source (carbon neutral) for the production of H2. If CO2 can be captured during the process, energy from biomass can be considered as carbon negative. The proposed research aims at developing a novel process for continuous production of H2 from agricultural/forestry wastes/biomass with in-situ CO2 capture and catalyst re-generation. Novelty of the process lies in the generation of relatively pure H2 with CO2 as a by-product without any external feed. Another unique feature of the process is internal regeneration of the catalyst, fouled in the gasifier. Thus, the technology will serve the twin purpose of regenerating the catalyst, and generation of nitrogen (N2) free H2 and CO2. The direct and indirect impacts of the research will be widespread. Fluidization is a platform technology that can accept various fuels. Furthermore, this research will also lower N2O emission and hence, will help to decelerate global climate change. Declining supply of cheap oil and gas may make bio-mass based power generator a viable option, while this research would help trouble free operation and add more value.  Overall the target of the present research is to develop innovative environmentally friendly technologies for the utilization of biomass for fuels and chemicals.

"Mammalian cell culture comprises a major platform for producing a number of high-value biopharmaceuticals, including enzymes, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), viral vaccines, hormones and immuno-regulators. The future of the biopharmaceutical industry will rely on the development and enhancement of these mammalian cell culture production systems. Such biologics are produced in relatively small quantities due to the highly specialized culture conditions needed and the susceptibility of the culture to either reduced productivity or significant cell death as a result of slight changes in culture conditions. While earlier generations of biochemical engineers focused on the non-biological aspects of production, such as reactor design, more recent engineering developments have recognized that the greatest potential for enhancing production lies within the animal cells themselves.

In this proposal, an important and often neglected aspect of bioprocess development, namely bioprocess optimization is addressed. This proposal deals with the development of a novel optimization strategy for production of therapeutic proteins by mammalian cells. The problem will be addressed by careful modeling and experiments including the manipulation of temperature, metabolites and metabolic pathways, bioreactor operating mode, and rate of traverse through the cell cycle of the organism under consideration. An important goal is the training of graduate students who are well versed in both the biological and the mathematical aspects of bioprocess optimization.

    )	Ultimately, the objective of the proposed work is to develop a robust strategy for the design of mammalian cell based therapeutic protein processing systems, including media design, bioreactor operation conditions and operating mode. The general strategy to be used can be defined as macro-scale metabolic engineering combined with modeling at the cellular level. The development of highly reproducible animal cell culture systems will have significant impact for many bioindustrial applications beyond the biopharma industry.

"The focus of this research program is to examine the dynamic relationship between normal physiological tremor and voluntary movements. In the next five years, we will focus on the ability to self-modulate physiological tremor (PT), i.e., reduce its amplitude. More specifically, we will (a) examine how amplitude and spectral characteristics of PT are modified on the contralateral side when attempting to modulate PT of the dominant hand, (b) whether there exists a relationship between age, the capacity to voluntarily reduce PT amplitude and finger dexterity, and (c) determine whether practice can increase the self-modulation performance.

Study 1: Objectives: Determine whether an attempt of PT to self-modulate PT has a bilateral effect on PT characteristics. Methods: Postural index finger tremor and muscle activity of both hands will be recorded in thirty right handed healthy young adults in three conditions: A) eyes fixating a line on a computer monitor, with no attempt to modulate (control condition); B) while attempting to reduce PT amplitude of their dominant hand without using muscle co-contraction as a strategy to stabilize the finger. Finally, C) they are asked to reduce their PT amplitude, this time using co-contraction strategy.

Study 2: Objectives: Determine whether a relationship exists between age, PT characteristics, manual dexterity and the ability to self-modulate PT. Methods:  Using the above protocol, we will examine the modulation performance of five age brackets.

Study 3. Objectives: Determine whether practice improves the ability to self-modulate PT. Methods: Participants will practice self-modulation for twelve weeks, testing will be done pre-and post-practice.

The proposed research program will render possible new strategies to improve motor accuracy, determine the importance of tremor within the neural motor scheme and help us understand the fundamental challenges faced by elderly individuals.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Integrative Animal Biology"

"Skeletal muscle, by virtue of its mass, is responsible for the majority of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and an important tissue in the regulation of blood glucose homeostasis. It is generally accepted that disturbances in fatty acid (FA) metabolism are a contributor to the development of impaired insulin signalling in skeletal muscle. However, the exact nature of this disturbance is a matter of controversy.  Impaired muscle FA oxidation is believed to be a fundamental cause in the accumulation of intramuscular lipids which impair the response to insulin. However, lipid accumulation is a function of many parameters including both uptake and utilization.  It is also a matter of controversy as to which lipid species are responsible for impaired insulin signalling in muscle (e.g. triacylglyerol (TAG), diacylglyerol (DAG), ceramide, etc). Considering the importance of insulin sensitivity and maintenance of normal glucose tolerance to the overall health of animals and humans, there is a clear need to have a better BASIC understanding as to HOW lipid metabolism regulates insulin sensitivity in muscle.  Thus, the general objective of the following research program is to determine which disturbances in muscle FA metabolism are likely to be the most important causative factors in disrupting the cellular response (signalling, glucose transport) to insulin.  Experimental perturbations to achieve this objective will examine:



1) The metabolic consequences of incubating isolated skeletal muscle with high concentrations of various types of FA i.e. polyunsaturates (PUFA), saturates (SFA), etc.  

2) The role of the FA transporter (FAT/CD36) as a regulator of lipid accumulation. 

3) The role of FA oxidation (utilization) in the prevention of lipid overload in muscle.  

4) The time course of coincident changes in muscle FA metabolism and insulin sensitivity.

5) The role of endurance training to improve FA metabolism and insulin sensitivity.

"All of the research in my laboratory, since its inception, has been directed toward gaining a better understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms that mediate and facilitate the remarkable malleability that is characteristic of the mammalian cerebral cortex. My perspective in the past was largely guided by studies of the postnatal development of cortex, as it is during this time that the neocortex is most plastic. It is our belief that the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie this plasticity are likely the same as are present in later development, and in old age, those that mediate processes such as learning and memory, and recovery from injury. The anatomical, molecular, physiological, and behavioural substrates that underlie the ability of neurons and neuronal networks in the cerebral cortex to alter their organization in response to changing sensory environments are largely unknown. However, it is known that neuronal activity profoundly affects the establishment and maintenance of neuronal circuits throughout the brain. In the most recent NSERC-funded granting period we have established abundant lines of evidence that implicate neurons that contain zinc in synaptic vesicles (are zincergic), and modulate the release of zinc in an activity- and experience-dependent manner, might play a special role in mediating synaptic plasticity within cerebral cortical circuits. Across this period of time we have also acquired a number of technologies that will allow us to better understand the specific role of zincergic neurons and synaptic zinc in mediating cerebral cortical plasticity. The tools include specific transgenic and knockout mice with altered expression of zinc signaling pathways, as well as the development of anatomical, molecular and physiological techniques and probes that allow us to monitor the activation zincergic signaling pathways. Using these novel tools, together with traditional physiological, anatomical, molecular and behavioural methodologies, we intend to continue our studies in rodent models to establish the role of zincergic neurons, and zinc itself, in the normal functioning and synaptic plasticity of cerebral cortical circuits.

This equipment is designed to provide water and oxygen free conditions for the safe and reproducible synthesis, characterization, and storage of new, highly air-sensitive compounds necessary for our research program. This program seeks to uncover new fundamental knowledge and properties by using ""chemical tricks"" (such as electronic and steric stabilization) to 1) isolate and characterize stable versions of compounds typically too reactive to be observed (reactive intermediates); 2) develop new families of compounds (ligands) capable of donating above-average amounts of electron density to transition metals. These ligands will subsequently be used in transition metal catalysis, with the goal of discovering highly active catalysts for new synthetic processes relevant to natural product synthesis, materials science, or industry (plastics, etc.); and 3) prepare soluble organic reducing agents that can compete with classical, insoluble, metallic reagents such as sodium. The solubility and organic nature of these compounds offers unique possibilities for reaction conditions and product selectivity, and the absence of any metal residues makes them promising reagents for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. This research program will therefore provide access to new fundamentally interesting molecules that will develop our basic understanding of chemical principles, but will also lead to important new synthetic reagents and methodologies.","Physical sciences",Chemistry

"The focus of my research program is to learn more about age-related change in cognitive function. Although the various aspects of cognitive change have been described in considerable detail, there has been a tendency to attribute these changes to a decline in some general process such as speed of information processing or frontal-lobe based executive functions. However, from a neurophysiological perspective, processing speed and executive functions themselves depend on a variety of neural systems for their operation and are, therefore, too broad to serve as an explanation for cognitive aging. The approach we are taking is to combine behavioural, electrophysiological, and cardiac measures to determine how the ability to modulate arousal through the autonomic nervous system can influence both mood, in the form of negative affect, and the capacity to control the allocation of attention during complex cognitive tasks.

Using a multidisciplinary approach of cell biology, genetics and immunology, we focus on the isolation of parasite and host factors that interact and ultimately influence the outcome of the infection. We will use genetic approaches to generate parasites that are impaired and unable to establish a normal infection in their host, and then locate the mutation responsible for the defect. This will allow us to identify important parasite factors that are required for infection. These molecules will then be characterized: we will study their properties, their localization in the parasite or in the host, and we will determine potential interacting molecules in physiological conditions in live host cells. By characterizing the interaction of host and parasite proteins, we can (i) gain knowledge on how the parasite manipulates the host, and how the host reacts; (ii) increase our chances for innovation not only for research on Toxoplasma and intracellular organisms, but also for numerous biology, biochemistry and immunology studies; (iii) train high quality students; (iv) develop new technologies and patentable products; (v) ultimately bring sociocultural and economical benefits to Canada and other countries.

"Wireless mesh networks have emerged as a new technology that has a significant potential to provide low cost

means for flexible and fast deployment of Internet based services in diverse environments. At the same time the

concept of cognitive radios brings a promise of increased bandwidth availability at a minimum cost. The

purposes of these two technologies fit each other in a very complementary way and this research proposal

focuses on the design of next generation cognitive wireless meshed networks that can support multimedia and

emergency services. We will develop architectures that can offer such services with the required QoS and

service continuity protection. A close interaction between all system layers will provide information for fast

adaptation to changing environments. To monitor these changes in traffic distribution and spectrum

environments, a monitoring scheme covering different time scales will be investigated. To make the best use of

available spectrum, we will define cognitive radio architectures that can provide features required by the

proposed service and resource management models. These features will be used by adaptive MAC and routing

mechanisms to provide the QoS and service continuity protection required by the considered applications. We

will propose a framework for resource management that provides balanced collaboration across all system

layers by means of well defined cross layer interfaces. The key element of this approach will be a novel

economic framework that takes into account network revenues as well as both static and dynamic costs across

different layers and time scales. This approach will provide coherent integration of network operator's cost

concerns and users' quality objectives. Bell Canada's involvement in the project will help steer the research

direction and emphasize practical considerations as well as facilitate knowledge transfer to industry.","Computer communications","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Communications and Information"

"The next generation networks (NGN) are envisioned to be an inter-working environment of heterogeneous transport networks that will provide a service platform that can integrate traditional and innovative IP services. These services should be available at any user location that can be also changing with time due to the user mobility. The heterogeneity of NGNs will have several dimensions that can be divided into two categories associated with technology and ownership, respectively. In particular the technology heterogeneity will require coopearation between wired and several wireless acces technologies such as 3G, 4G, WLAN, WiMAX, satellites, including wireless mesh. The resource management in such heterogeneous networks can be quite complex and to a large extent heuristic, which can lead to large inefficiencies, unless new models are developed that can address the issue in an automated and simple to understand manner. Therefore we propose to develop an integrated and consistent framework and mechanisms that would significantly facilitate NGN resource management and make it more efficient. The framework will be based on an economical model that can integrate and automate several timescales of operations and therefore can further reduce the network operation costs. Here we will use our experience and achievements with an economic model that was developed for homogeneous wired networks.  In this proposal we address three main elements of resorce management: connection/flow admission and routing, adaptation of network capacity, and service pricing. The main challenges are related to extension of the economic models to wireless access networks and to encouraging coopeartion between network operators. To overcome these challenges we will use models derived from Markov decision and game theories. We expect that the results of this research will provide algorithms and knowledge that will be used by Canadian operators to improve service quality and resource utilization in a cost efficient manner.

"Study of the Effect of Cathodic Protection Under Disbonded Coatings on Initiation of Cracks in Steel Pipelines



Near-neutral pH cracking is a significant problem in Canadian energy pipelines and has been the subject of two National Energy Board inquiries.  There is a gap, however, in our understanding of how near-neutral pH cracking initiates in gas and oil pipelines.  There is evidence that the conditions established around the pipeline (and hence employed in the studies of the phenomenon) are altered under the disbonded pipe coating by the action of the cathodic protection.  The proposed research will use the conditions under the coating, that have been shown to result from applied cathodic protection, and determine their effects on corrosion, pitting, crack initiation, and corrosion fatigue threshold.  This information will help us understand one of the unsolved mysteries in cracking - how the cracks grow beyond the usual dormancy observed in the crack colonies.  It is also expected to be valuable in the integrity management of pipelines and will contribute to an increased operating efficiency for pipelines.

"The proposed research will investigate the contributions that software engineering can make to the study of climate change, including the development and validation of large scale numerical simulations of climate, tools to foster the scientific collaboration among inter-disciplinary teams studying climate change, and the development of decision support tools to assist in evaluating policy responses for mitigation and adaptation of climate change. Our goals are: 

 - To investigate, from a software engineering perspective, how climate modelers get their ideas into working code, and deal with the long term evolution of their software. 

 - To identify suitable methods and tools to improve productivity, software reliability, and team coordination among the scientific communities who contribute code to climate simulations. 

 - To investigate the use of requirements analysis and data modeling techniques to improve accessibility to the huge volumes of data generated from climate simulations. 

 - To investigate the use of multi-stakeholder problem analysis techniques and decision support tools to compare and assess competing strategies for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases, at the individual, community and governmental levels.

This research will produce results useful to a number of different disciplines. In software engineering, it will contribute to a growing set of empirical studies of scientific computation, helping to characterize the distinct software development methods used by scientific communities. For climate science and global change studies, we expect to improve the ways in which simulation models are developed, and provide tailored software tools, thus improving software quality and productivity. Finally, our conceptual modeling tools will make a contribution to how people reason about sustainability and how they choose among competing ideas for reducing their environmental impact.

"Over the past fifteen to twenty years, data warehouses have evolved from haphazard and often poorly understood repositories of operational information to become one of the cornerstones of corporate IT architectures. Not surprisingly, academic researchers have shown great interest in fundamental DW issues, as well as those related to the complementary technology of Online Analytical Processing (OLAP). One over-riding concern with the design and implementation of contemporary warehouses is the sheer scale of the underlying databases, the largest of which now regularly exceed 100 Terabytes. Given the astounding computational resources required to support direct, interactive analysis within these environments, there is clearly a pronounced need for innovative research targeting the architectures, algorithms, design models, and data structures in enterprise DW/OLAP spaces.  



In the current program, we propose an algorithmic and architectural framework for the comprehensive parallelization of core data warehousing functionality. Specifically, we will explore new methods for scalable multi-dimensional caching and real time OLAP analysis, as well as the design of a more expressive and powerful OLAP query language. More importantly, these techniques - along with our previous methods for high performance OLAP processing - will be integrated into a fully parallelized OLAP server. In turn, this multi-CPU cluster will form the backbone of a grid architecture that will virtualize high performance computing resources across geographically distributed locations. By exploiting existing standards and technologies, including commodity DBMS platforms, embedded database systems, and grid development toolkits, our research group will be able to evaluate fundamental algorithmic research within realistic multi-user, multi-database, multi-Terabyte settings.  The end result should be a robust, flexible infrastructure that is uniquely suited to the massive analytical requirements on the horizon.

"Massive rock slope failures, such as those experienced as natural hazards in the form of catastrophic rockslides or in the mining environment as pit slope failures, exact a heavy social, economic and environmental toll. Ever increasingly, experts are called upon to analyse and predict - assessing risk, potential modes of failure, early warning alarm thresholds and possible preventive/remedial measures.



Recent technological developments have seen significant advances in rock slope monitoring capabilities. Remote sensing techniques based on satellite and terrestrial radar can now provide high-resolution full area spatial coverage of a slope as opposed to relying on geodetic point measurements. Automation in the form of wireless data acquisition and transmission has enabled the collection of data with increased temporal resolution viewable in real time. These tools provide increased capacity to detect pre-failure indicators and changes in rock slope behaviour. Yet the interpretation of rock slope monitoring data, especially that for early warning, still remains highly subjective as geological complexity and uncertainty continue to pose major obstacles. Techniques used for forecasting failure represent a further impediment as they are largely phenomenological and 'holistic', disregarding details pertaining to geological controls and the underlying slope failure mechanism.



This Discovery Grant application addresses these deficiencies, with the primary objective being the advancement and development of methodologies and guidelines to improve the interpretation of slope monitoring data through a mechanistic approach based on the integration of geological data and advanced numerical modelling. This research will help to increase our confidence in the use of slope monitoring data, especially when used for the purpose of improving early warning systems and rockslide hazard forecasts.

"Bacteria, beneficial or pathogenic, tend to colonise surfaces that are immersed in aqueous environments. The cells attach to the surface, become sessile and produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that form a gel-like layer in which the bacteria themselves are embedded. Colony numbers increase by cell division and vivid, highly organised microbial communities (termed biofilms) develop. Bacterial biofilms form wherever environmental conditions are favorable and nutrients are available to sustain microbial life. This ability makes biofilms one of the most successful life forms on earth. Biofilms can benefit engineered systems (mainly in environmental applications such as wastewater treatment, soil remediation, groundwater protection) or can become a threat (e.g, medical, food safety, biofouling, biocorrosion). Despite their name, biofilms do not form in homogeneous layers but they can develop in highly irregular morphologies like  cluster-and-channel architectures. It has been recognized, that besides modern high resolution microscopy techniques, mathematical models and computer simulations are also important tools to gain a deeper understanding of the complexity of biofilm processes. 

The aim of this research program is to develop and analyze such mathematical models and numerical algorithms for bacterial biofilm processes on the meso-scale (the actual biofilm scale, much larger than an individual cell and much smaller than the laboratory reactor) and to study them in computer simulations. This research program involves tools from several classical areas of applied mathematics, such as mathematical biology (in particular population and resource dynamics), analysis and numerical algorithms of nonlinear partial differential equations, continuum mechanics, and computational fluid dynamics. Under a  mathematical aspect, it will make in particular a novel contribution to the analysis of degenerated parabolic systems and their numerical solution.

"Hybrid electric, electric and fuel cell vehicles make extensive use of electrical energy and electric motors and generators. The electrical energy must be converted between various battery voltages (e.g. 300V, 42V and 12V) to power vehicle electrical loads and the motors/generators. High switching frequency (e.g. 10kHz-1MHz) DC-DC converters are used for this voltage conversion. The size of many of the converter components reduces proportionately to the switching frequency, so increased switching frequencies are desired. The problem is that switching loss increases proportionally to switching frequency, making DC-DC converters and therefore the vehicles themselves, inherently less efficient.



The objectives of the proposed research program include invention, analysis and experimental evaluation in the following areas for electric, hybrid electric and fuel cell vehicles:

i) Novel compact and high efficiency soft switching (low switching loss) DC-DC converter topologies to reduce switching and conduction losses.

ii) Novel MOSFET current source driver circuits to improve the efficiency of DC-DC converters.



The long term objective of this research program is to develop novel technologies to increase the power conversion efficiency for DC-DC converters for future clean and efficient automobiles. The technologies in the proposed program will be used in future generation hybrid electric, electric and fuel cell vehicles. It is expected that the technologies to be proposed in this research program will enable power conversion efficiency improvements of 3-7% for DC-DC converters, resulting significant improvements in fuel economy for electric, hybrid electric and fuel cell vehicles.","Energy storage and conversion","Electrical and Computer Engineering"
"A goal of my research is to design and analyze algorithms for problems in linear algebra. In recent years I have concentrated on algorithms that use randomization, in some way, to solve systems of linear equations over small finite fields. The algorithms that I study are inspired by (and, ideally, closely resemble) methods that are reportedly being used effectively to solve problems in computational number theory - which, in turn, are needed for cryptographic applications - but whose efficiency or reliability has not been rigorously established.



The results that I hope to obtain could serve to identify, and overcome, problems with the use of these algorithms that are not necessarily evident as they are presently used but that could cause computations to fail if the algorithms were used to solve a wider variety of problems. This type of work is necessary if these algorithms are to be included in computer algebra systems like Maple or Mathematica and made readily available for widespread use.



The particular work that I am now doing, and propose to continue, is in an area that lacks generally useful techniques for the analysis of the reliability of algorithms. This complicates my work but also makes it potentially more useful: It forces me to work to develop new techniques that would be of use for other researchers who are also working to solve this type of problem.

"Music sequences are difficult or impossible to learn using standard time-series analysis techniques. This is due to the fact that musical structure is elaborated over long time spans and is hierarchical, making it difficult or impossible to learn from local information. By example compare the phrase ""John ate the <?>"" to the musical sequence ""B C E <?>"" In the linguistic case, the words ""John ate the"" constrain the possible values of next word <?>.  In the musical case, the nearby notes ""B"" ""C"" and ""E"" do little to constrain what can come next.  This is not to say that music lacks constraints.  In music the constraints come from elaboration and repetition within the context of musical structure.  Unfortunately (for standard sequence learning tools, at least) this structure is elaborated over long time spans and at different timescales in parallel. I propose an investigation of how music is structured in time and how music structure can be used to constrain machine learning algorithms applied in the domain of music. The two-fold goal of the research is to (a) further our understanding of how music is structured and how music structure relates to music perception and production and to (b) improve the state-of-the-art for machine learning algorithms for two important music-related tasks: human-realistic music performance generation and music sequence learning. I will also address related tasks such as music classification, music similarity measurement and online processing methods for collaboration with real musicians. The key idea behind all of this research is that a better understanding of how music is structured in time will lead directly to better machine learning algorithms for music-related tasks. This work should have impact in machine learning, audio signal processing and music cognition. Portions of this research should be relevant in domains dealing with speech, video and related time series.

"Natural selection is widely viewed as the principal evolutionary force shaping the diverse adaptations that make organisms so well suited to their physical and biological environments. Yet, scientists are still learning how selection interacts with other processes of evolution (mutation, genetic drift and gene flow) in complex natural habitats. This research addresses two enduring and unresolved problems in evolutionary biology. First, I will continue a productive investigation into the evolution of inbreeding, particularly self-fertilization in plants. While many organisms reproduce by mating with unrelated individuals, selfing has evolved thousands of times, with profound ecological and genetic consequences. I will also continue relatively new research to understand the evolution of geographical range limits. Virtually all organisms have limited distributions, which poses a difficult problem: why does natural selection not cause populations at the limits to adapt to local conditions and spread outward? Because these two problems involve interactions among the major evolutionary forces, thorough analysis can change our fundamental understanding of evolution. Both problems have been analyzed using mathematical models, but there is a clear need for experimental tests of these models. To this end, we will perform surveys of geographic variation, molecular-genetic assays, manipulative experiments in natural habitat and genetic experiments in controlled environments using a set of flowering plants proven to be exceptional experimental subjects. Our long-term goals are to better understand (1) how natural selection shapes reproductive behaviour; (2) how selection interacts with the other evolution processes; (3) the genetic and ecological constraints on adaptation; and (4) how evolutionary forces play out across multiple spatial scales.

"In a wireless sensor network, many distributed nodes observe a physical phenomenon, and communicate their findings to some central station, known as the data sink. Sensor networks represent an important emerging field of engineering research, with numerous potential applications in diverse fields, from security to wildlife

monitoring.



Wireless sensor networks present a challenging problem for communication. The sensor nodes themselves have stringent energy and computational constraints. Meanwhile, the wireless communication environment is affected by many sources of distortion, such as interference or fading, any of which could cause a loss of signal. It is known that the nodes in a sensor network can achieve higher information rates through co-operation, and especially through acting as relays for each others' signal. Through relaying, each node has access to several independent paths from itself to the sink, and with each additional relay, there is an increasing probability that at least one path to the sink will be usable. However, this solution imposes a burden on the relaying nodes, as they cannot send their own information while helping their neighbor.  Furthermore, it requires the relaying nodes to consume their precious energy and computational resources.



The proposed work will investigate methods for maximizing the information transfer rate through a wireless sensor network, particularly addressing the burden incurred in relaying through methods such as distributing it over as large a set of nodes as possible, or using simplified algorithms locally at each node.  With a focus on feasibility, the proposed work will, if successful, lead to the deployment of sensor networking hardware which exploits advanced concepts in wireless communication technology.

"We apply the techniques of quantum field theory to different physical systems under various external conditions. Our first system consists of a Georgi-Glashow model (composed of a triplet of scalar fields and SO(3) non-Abelian gauge fields) conformally coupled to gravity. We have already shown in a previous work that magnetic monopole solutions in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime exist in this system. In this  proposal we break the conformal symmetry by adding quantum matter corrections to the action leading to the conformal anomaly. Our preliminary analysis shows that an Einstein-Hilbert term (General Relativity), a cosmological constant and massive scalars, which do not appear in the original action, emerge after an expansion of the action about the non-trivial vacuum and dominate the low energy or long distance regime. The conformal anomaly fixes the scale and we anticipate that the gravitational constant G, the cosmological constant and the mass of the scalars can be expressed in terms of the parameters of the theory. 

We recently developed a novel multidimensional cut-off technique that yields explicit expressions for the finite and cut-off dependent part of the Casimir energy under Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. The formulae are highly useful and have been applied to the Casimir piston, a topic of great current interest. In this proposal we extend our D-dimensional Casimir piston analysis to include the significant effects of finite conductivity and temperature corrections both of which are of experimental interest in 3+1 dimensions. Quantum fluctuations of the quasiparticle vacuum in a zero-temperature Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) offer us a unique opportunity to study the Casimir effect for a field other than the usual electromagnetic field. In a previous work we studied the Casimir effect in a homogeneous BEC. In this proposal we go beyond a homogeneous BEC and study the Casimir effect of a non-homogeneous weakly interacting BEC constrained to one small and two large dimensions via a trapping potential V. This system reduces to two coupled nonlinear differential equations containing the quantum fluctutation field and the condensate field.

"Environmental contaminant exposure is an escalating concern and assessing the human risks associated with such exposure continues to be an inexact science. Risks are largely based upon the extrapolation of exposure and effect in animals to those in human. The use of modeling and simulation has been used as an aid for understanding the relationship between chemical exposure, from food or air, and response. By building virtual organisms in computers to represent both laboratory animals and humans, the movement of the contaminant in the human body can be modeled based on experimental tests in animals. Because we cannot ethically expose humans to contaminants, this represents the best means at predicting human exposure. These virtual organisms must accurately represent the true form and this proposal aims to ensure that the movement of chemical from external exposure to internal or organ exposure is well represented. Since response is based on organ concentrations of the chemical, understanding this process is imperative. This will allow predictions of how the external exposure relates to organ exposure across different species.","Modelling and mathematical simulation of natural processes","Integrative Animal Biology"
"Deep-sea corals and sponges are important habitat-structuring organisms in the deep-sea, but they are highly vulnerable to the impacts of bottom-contact fishing and other disturbances.  This project will study deep-sea corals and sponges in three areas in international waters along the continental margin of Newfoundland: Orphan Knoll, along the margins of the Orphan Basin, and along the edges of Flemish Pass, the deep-water channel separating the Flemish Cap from the Grand Banks. The research will document the nature of the geological features that support coral habitat, coral density, paleoceanographic records in coral skeletons, fish and invertertebrate biodiversity associated with corals and sponges, fish utilization of deep-sea coral habitat, genetic connectivity among coral populations, and near-bottom (boundary layer) turbulence induced by large gorgonian corals. In-situ mapping and video of deep-sea corals and the geological features supporting their habitat in Newfoundland and Labrador waters uses the Canadian research Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) ROPOS.  Results of the cruise will be highly important for Canada's efforts to meet its United Nations commitments to manage and protect vulnerable marine ecosystems both inside and outside the 200-mile limit along the continental margin of Newfoundland and Labrador.

"Deep-sea corals are important long-lived structure-forming organisms in deep waters of Canada's three oceans.  Deep-sea corals in Atlantic Canada's waters include more than thirty species of sea fans, black corals, soft corals, cup corals, and sea pens.  Most of the sea fans, black corals and soft corals require rocky bottom on which to grow.  This project will examine the geological origins of hard bottom areas in which corals grow, most of which are thought to be related to remnant glacial deposits.  

Some deep-water coral species can live for several centuries.  This project will measure the growth rates and lifepans of the sea fans, black corals and cup corals, and examine the oceanographic factors affecting variation in growth rates.  Corals will be aged using carbon dating and annual growth rings deposited in their skeletons.

Deep-sea corals are thought to provide habitat for a variety of deep-sea invertebrates and fishes.  Corals may be important as habitat for juveniles of several commercially important species.  Corals also form biodiversity hotspots in the deep sea, which is generally not well explored.  The diversity of fish and invertebrates inhabiting coral and non-coral habitats in similar depths and on similar substrates will be compared, in order to assess the importance of deep-sea corals to marine biodiversity and its conservation.

Deep-sea corals are threatened by bottom-contact fishing using a variety of fishing gears.  This project will continue studies of the relative impacts of different fisheries and gear types on deep-sea corals in the waters of Atlantic Canada.  The distribution of corals will be compared with the distribution of fishing effort to suggest optimal conservation plans for deep-sea corals, to achieve maximum conservation benefit combined with minimum disruption to fisheries.  This project will provide much-needed scientific guidance for deep-sea conservation in Atlantic Canada.

"Titanium alloys-despite their high strength to mass ratios, good high temperature stability and fatigue and corrosion resistance-have significant shortcomings that preclude their use in many components subjected to sliding contact: Compared to other materials of similar strengths such as steel, titanium alloys have high rates of wear, high coefficients friction, unacceptably high rate of material transfer and adhesion to the counterface and thus are prone to galling and seizure.

The main objective of the proposed research is to improve the wear resistance of titanium alloys, which limits their industrial use, without causing deleterious effects to other critical mechanical properties especially under cyclic loading. The shortcoming of existing surface treatments performed in order to increase the wear resistance is that they are done at the expense of fatigue properties. Thus, this proposal seeks to understand the microstructural changes that occur as a result of sliding wear and fatigue damage in Ti-6Al-4V alloys subjected to plasma-nitriding and thermal oxidation. Then, a surface treatment process that would provide wear resistance without sacrificing the fatigue resistance will be determined. To achieve the objectives stated above, the specific problem that will be addressed will focus on the investigation of the compound surface layers such as TiN or TiO2 and diffused layer that form during nitriding or thermal oxidation treatments. These studies will be undertaken using a combination of microscopy techniques (including focussed ion beam) and instrumented indentation methods and will shed light on the effect of microstructure developed after the surface treatments on wear and fatigue. The proposed project will expand the use of titanium in major Canadian industrial sectors, ranging from the aerospace to automotive and biomedical. This project will train either two M.A.Sc. students or one Ph.D. student and one M.A.Sc. student per year.

"This research aims to improve understanding of how microbes transform and detoxify common pollutants in the subsurface and to use that knowledge to devise efficient and cost-effective ways to bioremediate contaminated sites and to protect valuable water resources.  Over the last decade, we have studied benzene biotransformation in an anaerobic, mixed microbial culture that converts benzene to methane and carbon dioxide. While the culture comprises a dozen or more different microbial species, it is overall functionally highly stable.  Within the culture, fermenting and acetogenic bacteria rely on methanogenic archaea to maintain low concentrations of hydrogen to drive otherwise thermodynamically unfavorable reactions.



In 2007, the U.S. Dept. of Energy (DOE) Joint Genome Institute (JGI) selected this culture for metagenome sequencing because it is an excellent model for syntrophic contaminant degradation.  In this Discovery Grant research, we will focus on one long-standing question: what are the biochemical steps required to break down benzene without oxygen?   This biochemical mechanism remains completely unknown despite decades of research.  To address this problem, we will take an iterative approach of computational and experimental analyses.  We have initiated a shotgun proteomics approach, informed by the metagenome sequence, to identify differentially expressed proteins and hone in on the elusive enzymes that act on benzene.  We will also make use of new inexpensive sequencing technology to sequence transcripts extracted from the culture during benzene biodegradation, and again by comparison of partial transcript sequences to the larger metagenome sequence, we hope to identify putative genes that are actively transcribed during anaerobic benzene biodegradation.

"Methane clathrate hydrate is a solid compound of water and methane. It has been discovered by drilling and integrated geophysics beneath the sea floor in water depths exceeding 500m off the west coast of Vancouver Island. Hydrate has even been trawled to the surface by fishermen. Worldwide, similar deposits are estimated to contain an amount of hydrocarbon that exceeds the sum in all other known reserves. The material may well become the clean burning fuel of this century. Methane is also a powerful greenhouse gas. It is clear that the detection, evaluation and long term monitoring of deposits is of importance, not only to determine the  resource value but also for natural hazard and environmental assessment.

    Variations in physical properties may be used to estimate the mass of hydrate present in a sedimentary section. Mechanical stiffness is increased due to cementation of sediment grains. Electrical conductivity is decreased through the displacement of conductive, ionic pore fluid by insulating solid hydrate. We have developed two assessment methods. The marine controlled source electromagnetic method (MCSEM) is used to estimate the integrated electrical conductance of the hydrated zone while the complementary compliance method estimates stiffness by correlating the sea floor motion with the forcing pressures of long wavelength, ocean surface gravity waves. The  experiment is quite a technological challenge because sea floor displacements have to be measured to an accuracy of a few tens of nanometers! We have used both methods successfully to indentify large hydrate deposits.

     Project NEPTUNE, the wiring of the sea floor of Cascadia with power and high-speed internet, is scheduled to be installed in late 2008. One NEPTUNE node is located near ODP hole 889 in the vicinity of a major hydrate deposit and gas vent. We will install MCSEM and compliance systems designed and built at Toronto near the vent to image the deposit and monitor its long time changes. MCSEM transient sources and receivers will be located in arrays on the sea floor and in vertical and sub-horizontal boreholes surrounding the deposit.

"Mathematics is increasingly valuable in studying complex physiological systems, such as the genetic control of cell functions and control of movement by the brain and nervous system. This research project deals with mathematical models of such 'networks', both to help understand and explain their dynamical behaviour, and to discover underlying mathematical principles at work in any networks of interacting components.

One aspect of the research program is to use neuronal network descriptions of parts of the brain's motor circuitry and methods of nonlinear dynamics to study movement abnormalities resulting from Parkinson's disease such as tremor, and the means by which high-frequency electrical stimulators implanted in particular brain structures alleviate these symptoms. (Remarkably, how they work is not well understood, despite their common use.) The network of brain structures involved in motor control is complex, and it is not yet clear how these stimulators operate physically, why they can be placed effectively in one of several different brain structures and how these structures communicate.

Genes control the production of proteins that carry out cell functions, but these proteins regulate the activity of other genes. Thus, networks of interacting genes underly cell development and metabolism. One gene-regulated process that is dynamically interesting is the circadian (daily) oscillations of some proteins in cells. Such oscillations are common across many organisms but involve different biochemical components and genes, so a challenge is to understand how they arise and operate and why they are so strongly persistent (jet lag, for example, is only a temporary disruption in our own circadian rhythms). This is a question involving interacting network loops, and another main thrust of my research program is to understand from a mathematical point of view how the pattern of interconnection determines dynamical behaviour in general networks with components that switch on or off. This framework permits analytic methods to probe quite deeply into complex dynamics, and thus contributes to the mathematics of complex systems as well as providing insight into physiology.

"The proposed research will determine how changes in the pattern and intensity of atmospheric circulation have affected the climate of western Canada over two important time-periods: (1) the past century and (2) the past millennium. The investigations are based on mapping and modelling of the relative abundances of naturally-occurring heavy isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in precipitation, which yields fundamental information about temperature, moisture, atmospheric circulation regimes, and other aspects of climate variability and change. Studies of the past century will analyse precipitation isotope fields and climate linkages across the western Canadian Cordillera from the Pacific Coast to Northern Great Plains since the end of the Little Ice Age. The climate of this period (especially the last 50 years) is captured in detail by instrumental climate records, as well as by a newly-developed climate model that can simulate the expected precipitation isotope fields under specified conditions. Isotope fields for selected time-slices will be mapped using a combination of existing isotope data from direct sampling of precipitation over the past ~ 40 years and precipitation oxygen-isotope composition reconstructed from analysis of tree-ring cellulose over the full century. The combination of instrumental climate data and reconstructed and model-generated precipitation isotope fields will afford an unprecedented opportunity to develop physically-based understanding of spatial and temporal isotope-climate relations, which can then be used to interpret the climate of the pre-instrumental period. Studies of pre-instrumental climate will probe climate variability and change and the associated impacts on water resources at key times in the past millennium from extended tree-ring isotope records. One of the most pressing concerns is to develop better understanding of the atmospheric circulation regime that led to widespread drought across western Canada in Medieval times, because of the possibility that climate may be in the process of returning to a similar state.

"Operators of mobile machinery are exposed to whole-body vibration.  International standards exist to suggest safe exposure durations for vibration exposure; however, the existing standards do not account for increased injury risk associated with non-neutral working postures.  Yet, many machine operators have to adopt bent forward and twisted neck and trunk postures in order to operate mobile machinery.  In order to understand the impact of non-neutral postures, in combination with whole-body vibration exposures, on injury risk, the transmission of vibration through the body can be studied.  This project will measure vibration transmissibility from the seat to several levels of the spine and head under different levels of vibration exposure and rotated trunk/neck postures.  If vibration travels through the body differently it could indicate machine operators working in non-neutral postures have a higher injury risk than operators in neutral postures exposed to the same vibration.  An improved understanding of vibration transmissibility under non-neutral postures can also be used to improve existing international standards that are used to determine safe vibration exposure durations.  Improved standards will help to protect equipment operators from negative health outcomes, such as low-back pain.  Injury prevention will be beneficial to machine operators, industry and the Canadian economy.

"There are two projects in my NSERC Discovery Grant. The first project investigates the functional diversity of root-associated mycorrhizal fungi at an alpine site in Jasper National Park, and at an arctic site in Wright Pass on the norther border of Yukon and the NWT. We are trying to determine how experimental warming (to simulate the effects of global warming) affects the beneficial mycorrhizal fungi and bacteria associated with the roots of tundra plants. We are amplifying DNA from the microorganisms and subjecting it to ""DNA fingerprinting"" protocols to identify the types of fungi present and how they are responding to the warming treatments. We will also set up experiments to look at how removal and addition of key plant species affects the diversity and types of mycorrhizal fungi on the remaining plants. The second project examines the functional diversity of mycorrhiza-mediated carbon and nitrogen transformations. Although the term ""mycorrhiza"" specifically refers to the association between fungi and plant roots, we know that there are also many different types of bacteria occurring on and within the mycorrhizas that may be involved in carbon- and nitrogen cycling. These nutrient-cycling processes ultimately determine if nutrients will be available or limiting to arctic plants. We are interested in the different activities associated with different types of mycorrhizas, and we use functional genes that code for key enzymes that mediate the different processes as a way to study them. These experiments will provide insights into how root-associated microbial communities will respond to future climate change scenarios. If arctic plants respond to warming by allocating more carbon to their root systems, and it is confirmed that root-associated microbial communities are responding by increasing their biomass, then this could be an important negative feedback loop offsetting the effects of climate change.

"Research will focus on two aspects of the Proterozoic (1000 to 2100 million year old) Namaqua-Natal Belt, determining:

1) Zircon ages and Rb-Sr, Pb-Pb and Sm-Nd isotope compositions of various metasedimentary and intrusive lithostratigraphic units,

2) Comparison of results for the Namaqua-Natal belt with other areas in the world which might once have been adjacent to it



Focus will be on the Gordonia sub-province since no isotope or geochronological studies have been performed on units in the domain since the early 1980's.



Aspects which are to be addressed by the research include: to what, if any, extent are the metasedimentary units derived from older precursors, such as those exposed in domains to the east and west; how significant are contributions of older crust to intrusive lithologies; was the Gordonia sub-province a unique tectonic fragment accreted to the Kaapvaal Craton and, if so, when. 



Better constraints on the age of individual units will assist palaeomagnetic work to be performed by collaborators. As a result of the proposed research, the position, age and origin of rocks within the Gordonia sub-province will be used to further constrain the regional development of the Namaqua-Natal Belt and facilitate correlations with other belts potentially involved in the Rodinia supercontinent or even in older supercontinents.

"The shikimate pathway connects primary metabolism with the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. In plants, these are indispensable not only for protein biosynthesis, but also for the synthesis of numerous natural products including lignin, which is quantitatively the most important sink of the shikimate pathway. Lignin quantity and composition determines wood quality, but is a major hindrance in pulp and biofuel generation from wood. In recent years, the close relationship between the phenylpropanoid and shikimate pathways has been revisited. It is now clear that the first lignin specific step uses as a cofactor intermediates of the far upstream shikimate pathway (namely shikimate). Here I plan to address the hypothesis that this biochemical coupling may prevent irreversible carbon flow into lignin at times when insufficient amounts of shikimate are available to ensure that sufficient aromatic amino acids are available for other activities (e.g. protein biosynthesis). 

Quinate, a direct derivative of shikimate, may be utilized by the same set of enzymes then leading to the biosynthesis of chlorogenate. Chlorogenate is an anti-oxidant with anti-fungal activity that accumulates to high levels in leaves of some plants including Populus. In addition to its role in defense, I hypothesize a function as a long term storage form of lignin intermediates. Chlorogenate may be remobilized at times of low energy production but high demand of lignin, as it occurs during late wood formation.

Using a functional genomics approach I plan to identify and biochemically characterize the gene families involved in the biosynthesis of shikimate, quinate and their esters. Using reverse genetic approaches, the hypothesized diverse physiological functions of these intermediates in regulating carbon flow into lignin can then be addressed directly.

"Carbon nanotubes and silica-based nanoporous materials are an important part of nanoscale science and engineering and, as such, are paving the way for the development of a wide array of new materials, which will be used as building blocks for novel chemical and biochemical processes and technologies. The surfaces and

interphases that define nanotubes and nanostructures strongly influence, and often dominate, their behavior. Surface characterization is key to their control and therefore cruical to further advance. Recently, we have acquired state-of-the-art infrastructure equipment for surface characterization of nanoporous materials through the CFI grant (Leaders Opportunity Fund program). This will greatly enhance our capabilities to obtain critical information in understanding complex adsorption/diffusion and catalytic phenomena in nanoporous materials. 

In this proposal we will synthesize and characterize active surfaces of carbon nanotubes and novel mesostructured nanoporous materials. The ultimate objective of the proposed characterizations is to relate adsorption/diffusion properties to the structure of CNT's and novel nanoporous, composite materials. This will allow us to refine the material pore system in a controlled way to obtain the properties required for specific applications. The originality of the research stems from the specific methodology that will be used to characterize materials produced in our labs and to relate the properties of these solids to the requirements of specific fields of application, such as gas and liquid separations, based on adsorption and chromatography and the heterogeneous catalysis of reactions related to bio-fuel synthesis.","Materials sciences","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng."

The challenge we now face is how to extend the local control over the materials structure on a nanometre length scale to millimetre and centimetre length-scales and how to chemically imprint this information into a molecular structure.  Our approach follows nature's example and employs self-organization.

"The deployment of cost-competitive, highly efficient, and environmentally benign energy conversion technologies is a major global challenge. In spite of excellent technological prospects, commercialization of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFCs) in transportation, electronics, and stationary power generation is far from being guaranteed. Critical progress in power density, cost reduction, and durability hinges on new concepts in the design of structurally optimized catalyst layers (CLs) with high reactivity at ultra-low content of platinum (Pt). Our effort integrates complementary research competencies in theory and modelling of electrochemical materials for fuel cells, materials design and characterization, electrochemical surface science,

and fabrication and experimental diagnostics of operational PEFCs. Advanced CLs will be developed in parallel along different avenues as directed by modeling studies. Two of the proposed architectures for improving performance and cost-effectiveness are ultrathin and hierarchically structured substrates onto which nanoparticles of Pt are deposited. Conductive substrate materials incorporating Pt will be fabricated and characterized at 4D LABS and Queen's. Integration into PEFCs and in-situ evaluation will be performed in collaboration with the NRC Institute for Fuel Cell Innovation (IFCI). Modeling studies at SFU, U. Alberta, and NRC IFCI will determine initial design specifications, provide diagnostic capabilities, and establish the basis for the systematic structural optimization of the layers. Confidence in the principal feasibility of the targeted

improvements is predicated upon our insights into structure, processes, and performance of CLs from theory and modeling. Confidence in its practicability stems from recent advances in materials science, which provides various routes to the fabrication of host materials, consisting of ordered, hierarchically structured or disordered networks of nanochannels.

"Securing the future energy needs in a sustainable and environmentally responsible way has become the highest priority global concern. Enormous research programs worldwide explore polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC) as promising power sources for vehicular transportation, portable applications, and residential power units. Unrivaled thermodynamic efficiencies, high energy densities, and ideal compatibility with hydrogen render PEFC a primary solution to the global energy challenge. In spite of these assets and recent successful demonstrations of PEFC, industry has identified a number of hurdles that fuel cells must overcome in order to succeed as power sources in commercial products. These include but are not limited to voltage efficiency, power density, operational range flexibility, cost of functional materials, fuel flexibility, and water handling. Moreover, fuel cells need to fulfill rigorous requirements on stability and reliability of performance. At present, the fuel cell industry fails short in providing required lifetimes for targeted applications. Due to these technological barriers, enormous interest in recent years has focused on understanding and mitigating degradation processes in fuel cells. The objective of this collaboration between Simon Fraser University and Ballard Power Systems is to develop modeling-based predictive capabilities for degradation phenomena (ageing) in PEFC. This work will be unique in establishing relations between complex morphologies of materials, fuel cell design parameters, global operating conditions, failure modes of fuel cell operation and physical mechanisms of degradation. Initially, we will focus on the cathode catalyst layer, since it incurs the majority of the cell voltage losses. First, we will utilize phenomenological approaches to rationalize effects of defined structural changes on performance degradation. Thereafter, we strive towards a detailed physical understanding of underlying degradation mechanisms.

"The proposed program explores the realms of theoretical chemical physics and molecular modeling. The long-term objective is to develop hierarchical strategies in materials modeling, outfitted with predictive capabilities for the design of advanced functional materials and the diagnostics of their properties and operation. The main incentive stems from the urging energy challenge that drives worldwide research on fuel cells. Exploitation of the unique assets of polymer electrolyte fuel cells hinges on progress in their materials. Advanced materials have to preserve the unrivalled thermodynamic efficiencies and high energy densities of fuel cells, while they should boost the ratio of power density to cost. A primary goal on the materials science front is to develop proton conductors with enhanced proton transport and stability. The prevalent types of polymer electrolyte membranes channel protons through random networks of water-filled pores. The physical properties of these materials evolve over > 6 length scales, from mobilities of protons and water at molecular scale via structural evolution and physical processes at the mesoscale to macroscopic transport and operation. We exploit a well-devised hierarchy of physical-theoretical models to address these multiscale challenges. Major modules focus on polymer self-assembly, interfacial proton transport, and water sorption characteristics of hydrated polymers. Information obtained at different scales will be integrated into a cohesive description of membrane structure and function, which in turn will reveal the effects of the parameters that vary during synthesis, experiment, and operation. Thereby, this research could significantly enhance the prospects of efforts in assembling novel hierarchically structured membranes. Our research, moreover, makes vital contributions to the understanding of processes at biomembranes and lipid monolayers. The interdisciplinary outreach in materials science, soft condensed matter physics, and biochemistry together with the offered spectrum of theoretical and computational methods in physics and chemistry create excellent perspectives for the training of students and postdoctoral fellows.

"Continuous-flow mixing of non-Newtonian fluids is a vital component to many processes including polymerization, fermentation, waste water treatment, and pulp and paper manufacturing because of its demonstrated ability to improve product uniformity and minimize shut down, loading and unloading times. The current design of continuous mixing of non-Newtonian fluids is based on limited published information, and trial and error methods. The assumption of ideal mixing has traditionally been used to design these mixing processes. However, the complex rheology displayed by non-Newtonian fluids can create considerable deviation from ideal mixing. Studies show that the non-ideal flow such as short circuiting, recirculation, and dead zones significantly affect the performance of continuous mixing processes. In fact, a thorough search of the literature suggests that our current understanding and implementation of continuous mixing of non-Newtonian fluids is insufficient to ensure good mixing. In particular, design criteria incorporating mixing dynamics are needed so that acceptable mixing responses can be attained from continuous mixing systems. Thus, the long term research program goal is to develop methodology and tools to design continuous mixing systems for fluids with complex rheology through advanced flow visualization techniques (e.g. tomography and ultrasonic velocimetry), and advanced computational fluid dynamics methods. The work is of great importance to the chemical industry of Canada. The annual loss due to poor mixing is estimated at $10 billion in the North America chemical industry alone [Handbook of Industrial Mixing]. The proposed experimental and modeling research program will improve our understanding of continuous mixing of non-Newtonian fluids and answer some of the fundamental questions about the design criteria. Applying the finding of this study will improve variability reduction in the continuous mixing processes. This will lead to capital cost savings, chemical cost reduction, improved quality of products, and more efficient use of power. The proposed research will contribute to the training of highly qualified personnel by actively involving Ph.D. and master's students.

"This research investigates four models for the location of facilities, such as cell phone towers, landfills, ambulances, or production and service facilities. The first problem studies the location of firms, given that a regional planner offers subsidies. While the customers purchase the good from the least expensive source and firms maximize their profits, the regional planner offers subsidies so as to stimulate economic activities and, ultimately, maximize tax income. The objective is to devise subsidy strategies that best benefit the regional planner, given that the firms and customers behave in their own best interest. The ultimate goal is to research models that include competition between regions as well. The second strand of research considers the location of emergency facilities, such as clinics and ambulances. The objective is to use the smallest possible number of health care facilities that ensure that potential customers are still covered. The notion of coverage used here is softer than in the standard models that employ a ""covered - not covered"" dichotomy in that customer coverage gradually decreases with increasing distance to the facility. Multi-level health care systems are the specific focus of the work. Special attention will be paid to models with congestion, a crucial feature in the location of emergency facilities. The third class of models to be researched includes location models with multiple objectives. Typical examples of such models include the location of landfills, cell phone towers, and internet kiosks in developing nations. Typical objectives include cost minimization, coverage, and disturbances due to acts of nature or deliberate destruction. Furthermore, pre- and postprocessing modules will be devised that model routing and scheduling components without their explicit inclusion in the model, as this would make most problems of realistic size unsolvable. The fourth and last class of problems to be studied are competitive location models, in which competing firms locate branches of their respective facilities. Specific attention will be paid to models that not only include the firms themselves, but also their supplier. Another important aspect that needs to be investigated is the proper inclusion of customer behavior in the competitive context.

"Block copolymer vesicles (BCVs) are hollow spheres which can be prepared in solution from amphiphilic diblock copolymers. They range in size from ca. 100 to ca. 1000 nm, with a wall thickness of ca. 20 nm. In early work, we have shown that block copolymer vesicles can be prepared very easily by controlling the preparation conditions. They are part of a morphological continuum which includes spherical micelles and rods. Like liposomes, BCVs are promissing in many potential applications in fields such as pharmacology (in drug delivery), cosmetics and catalysis, but are much more stable than liposomes. We have shown recently that many vesicle parameters, such as size and wall thickness, can be controlled by external preparative conditions and polymer composition. We have also shown that it is possible to prepare, in one step,  vesicles with different interior and exterior interfaces. Furthermore, we have shown that it is possible to soften the wall on demand to permit active filling with ingredients such is doxorubicin (a cancer killer), to lock in the ingredients by hardening the wall, and than to ""re-open it"" on demand to release the contents. We have also shown that it is possible to invert the vesicles by exchanging the interior and exterior interfaces. We now propose to explore a ""breathing"" mechanism in vesicles which allows them to increase or decrease their volume repeatedly by a factor of ca. 10x within ca. 1 minute. This would allow the uptake and release of ingredients very rapidly. We have also learned how to incorporate nanoparticles such as dendrimers within vesicles walls, and now propose to study systematically the inclusion of a number of different species, including catalysts into vesicle walls. In addition, we propose to examine the incorporation of species of specific geometry (e.g. spheres) into block copolymer aggregates and to study the effect of strong interactions on morphogenesis of the resulting aggregates. Several other minor studies are contemplated including the exploration of diffusion through vesicle walls and the entrapment of large molecules inside the cavities of vesicles.

"In nature, strings of amino acids elegantly and readily fold into functional enzymes.  This example illustrates the power of organizational control.  Obtaining the same level of control over synthetic organic systems is an incredible challenge.  However, great interest within the bio- and nanosciences for such technology drives chemists to develop strategies for the formation of well-defined shapes in three dimensions.  One particularly interesting approach involves the design of a molecule that will have a particular response to the addition of a stimulus such as light.  For example, molecules have been built that will fold from an unordered linear state into a helix when acted upon by an external signal.  

This grant will be used to develop new ways to manipulate molecular structures, resulting in more complex architectures.  Our approach involves designing a molecule that has a well-defined, planar form in the neutral, or ""off"" state, and can be switched with an external stimulus to a complex, three-dimensional ""on"" state by initiating movement within the molecule.  The required movement will arise from the recognition of a certain chemical signal by the molecule.  The level of precision and complexity arising from such a tactic is a tremendous advantage over other systems.  Ultimately, the molecules that will be designed and synthesized in our laboratory will be used to form new gels or liquid crystals, forming the basis for a new class of sensor compound and smart materials.

"Exocytosis and membrane fusion are mechanisms used by all cells to maintain their survival and perform their unique functions.  This process involves the transport of intracellular vesicles to the cell periphery where they dock and undergo membrane fusion, resulting in the release of their contents extracellularly. For example, white blood cells can attack and degrade invading pathogens by releasing intracellular enzymes and chemical mediators of inflammation.  Since these enzymes and chemicals are toxic they are sequestered in intracellular packages called vesicles and only released by exocytosis and membrane fusion at the cell periphery when invading pathogens are sensed.

    The exocytosis process requires the coordination of multiple factors including the cytoskeleton, protein-protein interactions, calcium and lipid metabolism.  SNAREs are a class of proteins that have well-defined functions in the final process of exocytosis.  SNAREs form complexes across membrane undergoing exocytosis to catalyze their fusion.  SNAREs are divided into four subfamilies based on domain structure.  We are examining the role of on subfamily called longin-SNAREs.  These are very interesting since they are the only SNARE subfamily which is present in all living organisms (i.e. human, microbes, and plants). Longin-SNAREs contain an extended region called the longin-domain, the function of which is unknown.  Our research will define the role of longin-SNAREs, specifically attempting to understand the importance and contribution of the longin-domain to the mechanism of exocytosis and membrane fusion.

"Applications of mathematics have traditionally been sought in the natural sciences, and much of the historical progress of our discipline comes from answering questions raised by physics, engineering and, more recently, biology. I have always been convinced that the social sciences have the same potential as the natural ones, and that a true understanding of the problems raised by economics, for instance, will raise new mathematical problems, both at the theoretical and numerical level, and open new directions for mathematics (and new positions for mathematicians). On the other hand, old problems should not be neglected, because (a) they serve as a benchmark against which to test new mathematical methods which (witness, for instance, the tremendous advances of symplectic geometry in recent years, which is largely due to the progress of nonlinear analysis), and (b) there is a deep unity in mathematics, and results obtained in one field can turn out to be useful in another (stochastic analysis, for instance, including its most recent development, such as Malliavin calculus, has deeply influenced modern finance).

At the root of economic modeling nowadays is the basic assumption that individuals behave as to maximize their utility, so the closest mathematical connection is with optimization theory, understood in its broadest sense: not only deterministic, but stochastic, not only static but dynamic (control theory and the calculus of variations), with one or several optimizers (game theory). Through the calculus of variations, there is a natural connection with Hamiltonian dynamics and symplectic geometry, which will also be part of this proposal.","Natural resources (economic aspects)","Pure & Applied Maths - B"

"The zebrafish has become one of the most widely used species for the study of vertebrate development due to its characteristics that facilitate embryological analyses and the fact that large-scale genetic approaches are possible. The number of Canadian investigators using zebrafish has grown rapidly over the last few years. This increase created the need for a centralized resource center.  We propose to establish a resource center that will serve the entire Canadian community of investigators using zebrafish. Some activities of the center will take place at the University of Ottawa and others at the University of Alberta. The many benefits from such a resource center for the community include the distribution of zebrafish strains, transgenic lines, and mutants, along with the distribution of genomics materials such genotyping reagents and chromosome mapping panels. The resource center will also provide training for students and other trainees who need to learn advanced experimental techniques.  Finally, the resource center will be the site of multi-investigator genetics projects such as screens for novel mutations affecting specific genes, screen for small molecules with biological activity. Such projects are often too large and costly to be carried out by individual laboratories but are amenable to groups of investigators who use a common facility.  The national zebrafish resource center will facilitate studies in developmental genetics in several Canadian laboratories and will contribute to the continued increase in the research involving this important model system.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Major Resources Support"

"Vortex formation from cylindrical structures, under certain circumstances, can result in large-amplitude structural vibrations that are detrimental to their fatigue life and integrity. Hence, the problem of vortex-induced vibration (VIV) is central in many engineering applications. Owing to the recent boom of deepwater riser activities at both Canadian and International waters to bring oil from the seabed to the surface, a pressing demand emerges for efficient control methods of vortex induced vibration. Other situations, in which vortex-induced vibration poses a potential threat, include external flow past structures such as bridges, tall buildings, tall industrial chimneys, antennas, and marine cables and internal flow past heat exchanger tubes. Several forms of surface protrusions are known to alleviate the problem of vortex-induced vibration with diverse degrees of effectiveness and are widely used in a number of key industrial areas. Designers, however, develop these devices through ad hoc experiments with insufficient physical understanding of the controlled flow phenomena in relation to the resulting loading and vibration. 



To develop more robust and effective suppression technologies of vortex-induced vibration, a better understanding of the underlying physics induced by the deployment of geometric disturbances on the surfaces of cylinders is essential. The longer term objective of the proposal is to attain the physical rationale in this realm to aid the design of suppression devices. To this end, simultaneous characterization of flow patterns with resultant loading and pressure fluctuations is central in the proposed investigation to identify alterations of the signature of vortices on the stationary and vibrating cylinders with surface protrusions.

"The proposed research aims at providing innovative solutions for improved performance of concrete bridges

and building structures. The focus will be on the following projects:

1) Development of Corrosion-Free Bridge System: An innovative system for short- and medium-span bridges is proposed. The superstructure is built entirely from materials that are not vulnerable to corrosion. It consists of precast prestressed concrete truss girders and a concrete deck slab. The girders have top and bottom concrete flanges connected by precast vertical and/or diagonal truss members made of concrete-filled fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) tubes. The system has the advantages of reduced self-weight and enhanced durability, which allow for longer spans, reduction in the initial and maintenance cost and an extended life span of the structure. The objective is to investigate an optimum design. Computer modelling will be implemented to determine the optimum girder dimensions and reinforcement. Large-scale girder specimens will be fabricated and tested under static and fatigue loading and for long-term effects in order to verify the optimum design. The long-term objective is to develop guidelines and procedures for design and construction of the new system.

2) Enhancement of Precast Girders Using External Prestressing: It is proposed to enhance the efficiency of

U-shaped precast girders by reducing the web thickness and using external prestressing. Both analytical and

experimental investigations will be carried out to achieve optimum and more economical bridge design.

3) Efficient Reinforcing of Beam-Column Joints for Earthquake Loads: Design codes require large volume of

transverse reinforcement in the joint region, leading to congestion, difficulties in construction and weak joints.

It is proposed to use studs with double heads which have superior anchorage properties to ties and stirrups and

can provide better confinment and, hence better ductility and strength to the joint. Both analytical and

experimental studies will be carried out to determine the optimum layout of stud reinforcemnt within the joint.

"Micro-scale machining is becoming an important fabrication technology due to the increasing demand for miniaturized component in recent years for the aerospace, automotive, mold and dies and also biomedical applications. This is mainly driven by the needs for 1) better efficiency in energy consumptions, 2) better size to weight ratio and 3) higher portability in commercial and military applications [Woon, 2008].

   When manufacturing micro components, it is very critical to get the first part correctly in a shortest time and the most cost effective way. Therefore, the need to rely on multi-scale modelling to predict the behavior or workpiece microstructure under large strain, high strain rate and elevated temperature, part distortion or machine tool deflection increases. Multi-scale modelling is to integrate both micro-scale and macro-scale models into one machining simulation module. In general, micro-scale models are built to simulate the cutting process and macro-scale models are used to predict workpiece or tool structure deflection during or after machining. 

   The long-term objective is to numerically model and integrate micro and macro scales machining models to accurately predict cutting forces, part and machine structure deflection, stresses induced on the tool/part and thermal effects on part dimensional accuracy. In the short term (next five years), the research is comprised of studies on a) Developing a micro and meso scale orthogonal cutting model which is capable of simulating the influence of workpiece microstructure, tool holder and workpiece dimensions, b) investigate the feasibility of using Updated Lagrangian (UL) and Arbitrary Lagrangian and Eulerian (ALE) formulation techniques to simulate the micro and meso scale 3D plunging and parallel turning processes, c) study the effects of mechanical and thermal loading induced by the machining process on part and machine tool structure distortion using macro-scale finite element analysis, d) evaluate the feasibility of integrating the macro scale models for predicting machine tool and part distortion into the 3D micro/meso scale metal cutting models.

"Several emerging new applications and services, especially the ones based on massive data transmission, require capabilities non-offered by traditional Grid infrastructure. The later usually exploits packet-routed networks as non-deterministic resources. The constant evolution of optical network technologies combined with the dynamic provisioning mechanisms holds the promise to support these types of advanced applications and services. Nevertheless, the huge bandwidth offered by optical networks is still inefficiently exploited and needs appropriate killer applications. The global objective of my research program is to investigate new networking concepts and to propose innovative solutions in the context of service-oriented optical networks. I will study new architecture and protocols for the next generation of optical networks to support network and service virtualization. The emerging large scale applications require what have been referred to as ""deterministic"" network services that imply defined and guaranteed service-level parameters (e.g., minimum bandwidth, loss rate, latency and jitter). In addition, those services need to be provisioned across multi-domain heterogeneous networks. In order to create an optical network supporting virtualized sub-networks with different QoS-guaranteed end-to-end virtual links, I will first investigate a novel optical control plane that takes into account traffic dynamics. The aim is to provide a new intelligent control plane strategy with dynamic multi-granularity connections. The routing and bandwidth allocation for those connections will be performed under constraints: QoS guarantees interaction, computing resources and network state information availability. My new control plane will dynamically switch between high-level signaling for long-lived applications and low-level approach for finer applications granularity. My research project proposed in this application investigate three main tracks: 1) low-level signaling such as OBS (Optical Burst Switching) signaling 2) high-level signaling such as UCLP (User Controlled LightPath) and 3) multi-granularity resources optimization in service oriented optical networks to support network virtualization.

"Currently, the largest factor negatively affecting the potential for growth of load-bearing block construction is the change in design requirements related to seismic loading. According to the 2005- National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) both reinforced and unreinforced masonry structures are considered to be particularly vulnerable to seismic damage. The new seismic design provisions of the NBCC have partially resulted from the widely held view that masonry structures have limited ductility, and some examples of structural masonry failures. This has created a situation where a significant amount of research is needed to increase the ductility of masonry structures and document the resulting improved performance. 



Evaluating individual single-storey masonry walls provides valuable information on the seismic response behaviour at the element-level (i.e. individual walls). However, there are limitations to the information that can be collected from testing single-storey masonry walls. This is attributed to the fact that actual buildings are several stories high and typically, the overall system (i.e. building) performance is the main concern. Therefore, experimental research dealing with walls representative of actual construction and complete building systems is key to providing a better understanding of masonry building seismic performance. The proposed research will assess the performance of multi-storey masonry walls and complete model-scale buildings. Furthermore, this research will develop new cost-effective construction techniques to increase the ductility and introduce novel base isolation systems to improve the seismic performance of masonry structures.



This research represents a major area lacking in quantitative knowledge.  Documentation of new research and subsequent application of this knowledge in the NBCC, masonry standards, and design practice will greatly reduce the cost and improve the competitiveness of concrete block construction.","Structural engineering","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"

"This proposal promotes viable communities through allowing City residents the opportunity to collaboratively develop a collective situational awareness through an assembly of individual perspectives. This proposal focuses on empowering residents of Canadian cities to take a vital part in enhancing the quality of service delivered out of municipal infrastructures especially during real life events such as emergencies. We take the quality of this infrastructure for granted until it fails in some way (e.g., traffic congestions and vehicle incidents are becoming Canadian 'household' concerns). This makes the management of the civil infrastructure key to our societal and economical metabolism. In the platform, city residents use their mobile devices to report infrastructure status information; this requires minimal deployment of sensors for the applications considered. Situational content is transported to city headquarters using municipal wireless mesh networks (WMN) to enhance their ROI. City servers take advantage of the social relationships between city residents as well as their real-time physical location to filter and aggregate user-generated situational content. The WMN is used to transfer back situational knowledge to city residents (on their portable devices) roaming across the city. In more time critical applications, such as incident management, situational information (e.g., incident notifications) may ripple across the WMN covering highways notifying travelling cars and diverting traffic to avoid vehicle build up. In addition, City residents may query databases and locate real-time emergency information in an accurate and timely no matter where they are (e.g., evacuation scheduling and destination choice to the nearest safe shelters). The platform exploits the convergence of social computing and networking disciplines and relies on constructs that integrate features of municipal infrastructure and social relationships among city residents. This proposal contributes to the wireless cities vision, adopted in more than 25 Canadian cities, by enabling new types of value-added applications that supports emergency evacuation planning, traffic congestion management and vehicle incident management applications.

"As society's appetite for mobile information access continues to grow, next-generation wireless systems will undoubtedly need to provide unparalleled levels of capacity and functionality. Concepts such as multi-input, multiple-output (MIMO) technologies promise to deliver the required new levels of system capacity and reliability. Similarly, cognitive radio systems will redefine the way wireless devices utilize radio spectrum, hugely increasing the efficiency of spectrum usage, thereby creating opportunities for new wireless applications and services. However, these approaches will impose stringent requirements on the antennas which will have to cope with broader bandwidths, support multiple frequency bands, exhibit high radiation efficiency (to conserve battery life and improve the signal-to-noise ratio), and provide additional functionality such as filtering and duplexing, all within a relatively small device such as a BlackBerry. Perhaps one of the greatest challenges in deploying advanced communication protocols based on MIMO and cognitive radio concepts is realizing miniaturized antennas arrays that can be packed in handheld wireless devices.  To address these challenges we propose to develop advanced antenna technologies based on paradigm-shift metamaterial concepts and reconfigurability. By using this approach, multiple antennas could be placed in a handheld unit, while adaptively changing their radiation patterns to greatly improve signal quality and capacity. This research will not only fuel further innovations in one of Canada's most successful wireless IT companies (Research-In-Motion Inc.), but will enhance Canada's technological know-how and leadership in the wireless communications field, an area of economic and strategic importance.

"Metamaterials are artificial dielectrics with electromagnetic properties that transcend those of conventional materials. For example, in recent years, there has been intense research in metamaterials that exhibit a negative refractive index (NRI). Already, some of the properties of these NRI metamaterials have been revealed and exploited for a variety of applications. These applications include the demonstration of planar lenses that can resolve beyond the limits of diffraction and the development of a range of microwave devices with improved performance for wireless telecommunication applications. However, the field of metamaterials is still at its infancy and many exciting opportunities are waiting to be discovered and exploited for applications.

"In many places in North America the search for high quality of effluent, particularly phosphorus, calls for the use of chemicals. In Canada and the Canadian North low wastewater temperatures challenge the designer of biological plants in addition to the demand for an infrequent-maintenance process that will provide the highest effluent quality without the chemicals, while removing pathogens, hazardous compounds and nutrients. Present methods of treatment in remote areas are often inadequate even though the plants often discharge the effluent into the same receiver from which the community draws drinking water. It is proposed to develop a new reactor technology that combines biological treatment and membrane solids separation with electrochemical processes, that would solve the problem of attaining high effluent quality in the cold climate conditions. An electrokinetic membrane bioreactor (EKMBR) is developed that will remove organic matter, most pathogens, nitrogen and phosphorus and solids as well as endocrine disrupters such as hormones and heavy metals, leading to superior effluent quality without addition of chemicals, while minimizing the amount of sludge generated. The EKMBR process development will include optimization of biological treatment, minimization of the electrical current density for removal of phosphorus and organics and in particular decreasing the fouling of the membrane by eliminating the colloidal fraction, partially responsible for fouling, which continues to be the key operational problem of membrane-based biological systems.   The Project will enhance Canada's economy by providing cutting edge technology which will discharge much cleaner effluent at lower costs and without the use of chemicals. The reactor is also aiming at the emerging market of the limit of treatment (LoT) wastewater plants, recently proposed in case of fragile or arid locations in USA and threatened lakes in southern Canada.

The results from the first program will be particularly useful for upgrading the plants with primary treatment, or plants having a low efficiency of biological processes. The contribution to the knowledge might have an impact on current legislations on the management of wastewater/sludge in Canada.

Fourth program deals with an application of EK combined with other processes to advance the knowledge and develop new methods for the remediation of brownfields containing organic and inorganic pollutants. It is expected that the methodology will find a direct application: a) to ponds with petroleum sludge, b) in the formation of natural barriers around contaminated areas for cleanup of runoff, c) in the formation of strips in ditches for runoff collection, and d) into landfarming areas.

"Accessibility is a comprehensive measure of land use and transportation planning performance. Accordingly predicting effects of changes in land use and transportation systems over time is essential in generating accurate accessibility measures in the future. In this research grant I offer the generation of various accessibility measures accompanied by detailed land use and transportation change models that enables predicting changes in the urban system over time. These accessibility measures will be integrated in the land use change models to predict changes in the Montreal region. Measures of accessibility and land use change models will be used at the end of the project to generate a sensitivity analysis testing various scenarios being introduced by the Montreal transportation plan and showing the effects of partially implementing this plan on land use and transportation systems in the future.

"Creating sustainable cities requires cooperative effort to coordinate and optimize infrastructure developments. Effective coordination and collective optimization can be achieved if stakeholders (developers, designers, contractors, financiers, regulators, operators, general public, etc) are able to integrate their individual processes and maximize their collective interests. This research aims at developing a comprehensive theory of cooperative process integration in the infrastructure and construction domain. Through a game-theoretic multi-agent analysis, the theory will support stakeholders in co-designing an integrated process in a cooperative knowledge-based manner. The main short-term (years 1-5) objectives of this research are to develop a: 

- Knowledge model for representing the integrated process in a way that facilitates customized knowledge management and adaptable process integration (a context-aware ontology).

- Model for acquiring knowledge in the infrastructure domain (an epistemology). 

- Model for understanding the meaning of acquired knowledge (a semantology).

- Model for representing the obligations and rights that govern collaborative interactions (a deontology).

- Model for representing the motivations and value system of collaborators (an axiology). 

- Strategy for cooperative process integration based on these five models. The strategy will be applied into a prototype collaborative web system. Cross-stakeholder process integration will be modeled as a multi-agent system. A cooperative game theory-based approach will be used to analyze the interactions of stakeholders.



The results of this research will advance the knowledge and modeling of the cooperative infrastructure development process. Applying the results into practical applications will support Canadian stakeholders in integrating infrastructure development in a cooperative manner.

"We explore a novel approach to solve a variety of real-life strategic design problems that include logistics planning, call center staffing, inventory management, supply chain design, telecommunication network design, and airline scheduling. It is typical for these, and other realistic problems, that the stochastic nature of the process can not be captured using a known probability distribution function, or if this is possible the resulting performance measures do not have a closed form expression. These problems are characterized by a stochastic component that has to be taken into account at the strategic design stage, and are typically approached using stochastic programming and queuing theory. We explore another venue that imposes less restrictions on the type of distribution and setting of the stochastic component, leading to mathematical programs where some of the terms in the objective function or the constraints do not have a closed form expression and have to be evaluated using a simulation subroutine.

The first step in the approach is to decompose the problem in a way that isolates the mathematical programming component in one subproblem and the simulation component in another. The two subproblems are coordinated using a master problem. As the subproblems are typically hard to solve (especially the simulation one), it is necessary to tackle the master problem using a method that converges quickly to a desirable solution. For that, the Analytic Center Cutting Plane Method (ACCPM) will be used.

The application is part of a major research program to solve hard mathematical programming problems that arise in practice. The research program  combines mathematical programming and simulation to capture the complexities of such problems, without the need for  restrictive assumptions. It will  enable the training of graduate students in the modelling and solution of complex real-life problems that will hav a  direct impact on a number of industries.

"Within the body, cells grow in complex, three-dimensional environments, from which they receive dynamic mechanical and chemical cues. Within the lab, however, cells are typically cultured in static environments, bathed in media in polystyrene multi-well plates.  Creating more in vivo-like environments is critical for applications such as studying the mechanisms of diseases, and for culturing stem cells for tissue transplantation.  In recent years, advances in micro- and nanofabrication have enabled the engineering of microfluidic devices that allow the culturing of cells in environments in which active flows of media, concentrations of nutrients, and shear stresses can be introduced. In addition, nanopatterned surfaces have been used to guide the growth and development of a variety of different types of cells. Patterning at both the micro- and nanoscale can direct the behavior of cells in culture conditions.



It is also known that the chemical composition, modulus, and surface properties of a material can determine how it interacts with biomolecules such as cells and proteins. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is used in the majority of microfluidic devices, not because it has the most favorable properties, but because it can be easily patterned using soft-lithography.  It is proposed to investigate alternative materials for use in microfluidic cell culture devices.  Throughout this work, techniques for shaping biocompatible, thermoplastic materials such as polystyrene, liquid crystalline polymers, and poly(ether-ester) block copolymers will be investigated.  These techniques will include hot-embossing, and nanoimprint lithography.  The surface properties of these materials will be studied, as will their interactions with cells and proteins.  The ultimate goal of the work is to engineer more in vivo-like devices in which to culture cells, ultimately incorporating 2D and 3D nanopatterns designed to interact favorably with cells.  A long term goal of the project is to design and incorporate stimulus- responsive surfaces that can be switched between states which either promote or inhibit cell adhesion.

"The research is concerned with expanding the scope of computational cognitive theories to understand the human executive control function, or what might be viewed as the 'human operating system.' One basic question is how the human brain sets a future-directed intention: a decision to execute some action at a future time (such as remembering to buy milk at the end of the day) and the subsequent execution that activity, if and when environmental cues signal that conditions are appropriate to do so. The role of intentions in computational theories of intelligence is to direct attention and reasoning resources. This research develops cognitive theories, based on computer simulations and laboratory experiments, about how intentions are represented and manipulated by the human cognitive architecture. This has practical implications for understanding how humans can do several tasks concurrently. Understanding the cognitive microstructure that supports future-directed intentions is relevant to various cognitive engineering efforts, e.g., for the design of systems that support human performance in dynamic environments in which tasks are interrupted and then must be resumed after some appropriate time or when the environment changes. Interrupted tasks can be viewed as a future directed intention to resume an activity,and it is important to understand what kinds of factors impact whether or not such an intention is likely to be remembered and executed successfully.

"Co-contamination with complex mixtures of heavy metals and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-ligands is a common environmental problem with multiple biological consequences, including birth defects, immune suppression, endocrine disruption and cancer. Both AhR ligands and heavy metals are ranked highly on the list of the most hazardous xenobiotics in the environment, prepared by the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA). The AhR plays a central role in the toxicity of numerous aromatic compounds by controlling the expression of a battery of enzymes responsible for their metabolism. The toxicity of AhR ligands is based on their bioactivation by the cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) to yield mutagenic and carcinogenic intermediates. Many sources of environmental exposure to AhR ligands involve metal co-exposure. For example, heavy metals and AhR ligands are common contaminants of hazardous waste sites and are co-released from sources such as fossil fuel combustion and municipal waste incineration and as components of tobacco. Although environmental exposures involve co-exposure to complex mixtures, methods for assessing the potential risk to mixtures often assume additivity of responses, even though antagonism or synergy might exist. The novel aspect of this work is to understand the potential interaction between heavy metals and AhR ligands, which are common in the environment, on the expression of AhR-regulated genes to broaden our understanding of the important consequences for the toxicity of these environmental pollutants.

"The quest for pollution prevention, coupled with increased pressure and demand for environmentally sustainable processes and products, have spawned new rules and regulations in the process industry. Sustainability is defined as ""economic development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"", according to the 1987 Brundtland Report of the United Nations. This research will address the challenge of designing and managing chemical and biochemical processes in a sustainable and safe way. The long term objective of this research is to develop an integrated computer-aided framework for green (sustainable) Process Systems Engineering (PSE). This framework will extend upon the traditional PSE approach through the incorporation of environmental impact assessment tools, life-cycle analysis, sustainability metrics, and inherent safety concepts. We envision a framework that can be utilized to: (1) Perform process modifications on existing processes to reduce waste and energy consumption, and improve efficiency, (2) Take appropriate scheduling and reactive operating actions to minimize pollution under adverse environmental conditions or under changing regulations, (3) Select appropriate control options from a superstructure of available technologies, (4) Develop new processes that abide to economic, safety, and environmental considerations, and (5) Suggest robust green energy and power production pathways.  The consideration of economics along with concepts of green engineering is essential in order to preserve profitability; otherwise investment will not occur and environmental protection will be eroded. A number of case studies will be considered in order to illustrate how the findings of this research can lead to greener and profitable designs and/or production operations.",Engineering,"Chem. & Metallurgical Eng."

"During the past decade, there has been an international surge in interest and implementation of high-yield

forestry, using plantation-based intensively-managed forests to maximize the volume and value. High-yield

forestry provides fiscal benefits to the forest industry by lowering risks and rotation times, providing higher an

more quickly realized investment returns. Producing more wood on a smaller landbase is critical to meet the

dramatic increase projected for fibre demand and to reduce the ecological footprint of forestry. The BC

Ministry of Forests Research and Tree Improvement Branches, Canadian Forest Service, and large and small

forest industry members including seed and seedling producers, are actively developing, improving, and

protecting the newly developed high gain germplasm for several commercially important BC trees. The focus

of this Chair's research program is to create linkages between germplasm developers and operational users to

enhance the efficiency ofthe current tree improvement system by incorporating new innovations including

appropriate biotechnologies. There are three primary aims of this proposal: (1) to deliver higher genetic gains

by augmenting the traditional tree improvement delivery system with biotechnology techniques, (2) to

emphasize wood quality traits and value as end-products (deliverables) of tree improvement and silvicultural

systems, and (3) to incorporate deliverables produced by the Genome Canada / Genome B.C. into the tree

improvement system, focusing on end-product quality and realized genetic gains for traits ofinterest. The

research program will proceed in close collaboration with the Chair sponsors. Expected synergies include: (1)

maximizing the relevance ofthe research to the end-users, (2) seamless implementation ofresults into practice,

and (3) creating an collaboratory environment between germplasm developers and users. This program will

train highly qualified personnel needed in the forest industry and the related biological sciences.

"Carbon nanotubes (a graphene sheet rolled-up into a nanometer -a billionth of a meter- diameter tube) and nanoparticles (particles of which size is in the nanometer range) are among the most scientifically-exciting and technologically-promising materials in the wider family of Nanostructured materials (NSMs). Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nanoparticles (NPs) are at the heart of the highly-competitive worldwide research effort that continues not only to reveal their extraordinary properties/astonishing behaviors but also to demonstrate their potential for breakthrough applications in various fields (ranging from nanoelectronics to nanocomposites or drug delivery nanovectors). The development of novel synthesis methods that will permit a better control of the nanostructural characteristics of these CNTs/NPs, the ability to achieve their selective purification and their assembly are among the challenging issues that still hinder the exploitation of their full potential. These are also essential to access the intrinsic properties of CNTs/NPs in order to achieve better understanding of their fundamental nanostructure-properties relationship.

By capitalizing on the expertise I have been developing at INRS, for many years now, in the field of laser/plasma synthesis of NSMs, this proposal aims at addressing these challenging issues in the context of the three following projects: (i) the first is to develop novel laser based approaches for the controlled synthesis of single-wall-CNTs and their selective purification; (ii) the second project deals with the investigation of CNTs for photovoltaic applications; and (iii) the third project aims at investigating the non-linear optical properties of metal NPs arrays to develop nanoscale light sources (NLSs) for new high-resolution and high contrast nanobioimaging solutions. While the first project will contribute to build a strong Canadian platform for the controlled synthesis of CNTs (fuelling thereby the CNTs related research), the two other projects are anticipated to impact strongly the two high-priority fields of novel renewable energy sources and health care improvement, respectively.

"Ubiquitous computing environments will definitely change the way we go about our daily activities, as they will, more than ever before, facilitate our actions to be sensed, communicated, stored and searched electronically. The scale of the change should make every one of us care about the security and privacy problems created by these environments. Ignoring these problems would otherwise turn ubiquitous computing environment into an Orwellian society, where the norm is what Prof. Ron Rivest from MIT called the ""reversal of default"", where ""What was once private is now public"", and ""what was once easily forgotten, is now stored forever"". 

    The research program proposed here would focus on developing a comprehensive framework of protocols and algorithms for protecting the security and privacy of the occupants of ubiquitous computing environments. The framework would address the problem of data protection at two levels: 

   (1) at the network level, to ensure the availability of the sensing network, and to protect the integrity and 

        confidentiality of the sensed data, and 

   (2) at the user level, by developing dynamic control mechanisms that would allow the occupants of 

        ubiquitous computing environments to control what information is collected about them, how it is 

        processed, and under what circumstances it can be shared.

"Robotic systems for space application require enhanced autonomy with minimal human interaction. Although much emphasis in robotics has been at the cognitive level, more recent emphasis has been in situated robotics with mixed success but which has reached a limit in scaling to more complex behaviours. A biomimetic approach provides another level of investigation - in biological animals, morphological structures have co-evolved with their control structures. Indeed, structural and mechanical configuration in biological systems is exploited by the control system. Furthermore, the interaction of the organism with its environment is the driver of biological evolution (as this defines survival until procreation). This aspect of agent-environment interaction has been much neglected yet it is fundamental in biology. Part of this neglect results from different materials used in biology and engineering - engineering materials are designed for stiffness to deformation while biological materials evolved with toughness to fracture. Structural and mechanical compliance is exploited by biological systems as a dynamic buffer to physical interaction with the environment. Such dynamic interaction forces would otherwise be chaotic as inherent time delays of feedback control loops generate instabilities. Feedforward mechanisms are also exploited in biology to act as predictors but these also have limitations. Furthermore, biological systems make use of multiple control loops including tight control loops in which the concept of sensor and actuator are blurred during exploratory activity. This program of research seeks to further understand these aspects of robot-environment interaction by exploiting lessons from biology, thereby generating more robust autonomous robotic space systems. This will be applied to manipulators, rovers, sample acquisition devices and deployable scientific instruments for space application due to the need for remote but robust and adaptive autonomy. There are several approaches to be exploited which shall be be explored in this research programme.

"Each day we make thousands of reaching movements to objects in our environment.  When our reaching actions are performed more quickly, they are likely to be less precise.  This is because we must generate more muscular force for fast movements than slow movements.  With faster movements, we also have less time to use response-produced feedback to correct errors as the movement unfolds. Movement speed, at the expense of accuracy, can compromise the successful completion of the movement goal, and sometimes our safety (e.g., when working with dangerous equipment).  This research is concerned with the relationship between movement speed and movement accuracy, and how our central nervous system learns to regulate limb movements in order to achieve, not only optimal speed and accuracy, but also efficiency in terms of energy expenditure.  By examining three-dimensional movement trajectories under various sensory and task conditions, and at different points in practice, we can understand how people plan their limb movements and then correct any errors associated with movement execution as the movement unfolds.  By perturbing the environmental, task or sensory conditions during a movement, we are able to gain insight into the ability of the central nervous system to rapidly adapt to change.  In this work, we will also use magnetic stimulation to disrupt specific brain areas prior to and during limb movements to gain insight into the various neural systems responsible for precision limb regulation.  Our research will help us determine the extent to which movement planning vs the rapid use of visual and other sources of feedback contribute to limb control. From a practical point of view, this work has implications for skill instruction, the rehabilitation of various movement disorders and the design of safe and efficient work and play environments.

"This NSERC Strategic project proposal from researchers at the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the Universities of Sherbrooke (UdeS) and Alberta (UofA) and DALSA Semiconducteur (Bromont, QC), aims at developing highly integrated microchip-based systems for performing entire health care and life science diagnostics, from sample preparation and DNA amplification to protein detection and electrophoresis. Much work has been done in developing such microfluidics-based analysis system, variously termed micro-total-analysis-systems (uTAS), ""lab on a chip"", or BioMEMS systems. To date, however, most efforts have typically relied upon extensive (and expensive) external instrumentation, with comparatively little functionality integrated directly onto the chip itself. In recent work we have produced highly integrated medical diagnostic prototypes based on microfluidic chips and these enable a very significant decrease in the cost of medical diagnostics. The goal of the present proposal is to miniaturize existing external instrumentation and integrate it directly onto a microfluidic chip, in order to produce a single chip BioMEMS standalone life sciences diagnostic platform. We expect that the resulting single-chip diagnostic systems will produce a dramatic decrease in the cost of these technologies, making them accessible to healthcare. From a commercial standpoint, this strategic partnership between DALSA Semiconducteur and UofA/UdeS will translate into globally competitive technologies at DALSA Semiconducteur and further contribute to making Canada a major player in this area on the world stage.    )

"The objective of the proposed research is to verify a rather striking phenomenon that has recently been observed. Considerable evidence has now been assembled that a large class of quite complicated mathematical objects---virtually all naturally arising norm-closed algebras in Hilbert space (including those of interest in mathematical physics, and in other branches of mathematics in which complex systems are considered, such as the theory of dynamical systems and the theory of foliations)---can be completely described in terms of very simple data---the so-called K-theory invariant. (Sometimes now referred to as the Elliott invariant.)

    On the one hand, this is most unexpected. (But the evidence cannot be ignored.) On the other hand, this discovery has far-reaching implications, both for the class of objects involved (in technical terms, the class of separable, amenable C*-algebras), and, it appears likely, for the related areas of mathematics and physics in which these objects appear. (For instance it is pertinent to the study of orbits of dynamical systems.) (Roughly speaking, for Cantor systems the C*-algebra invariants and the orbit invariants are the same!) 

    The evidence, of several kinds, for the classification picture that I have proposed, is indeed strong. To establish the truth of my conjecture, however, or even to formulate it precisely in full generality, will still require a major investment of resources.

    It is too early for the importance of this discovery to be assessed fully. Comparable classification schemes, well recognized to be important (although perhaps still not fully understood), are the Linnaeus classification of biological species, by means of several levels of orderly division, the Mendeleev classification of chemical elements, by means of the periodic table, and the recent classification of subatomic particles in elementary particle physics, as assemblages of different kind of quarks. (A mathematical analogue is the classification of finite simple groups.) The classification of amenable C*-algebras need have only a fraction of the impact of these earlier discoveries to leave an indelible mark on science.

"The central theme of the research is the optimal estimation of signals observed in noise. The most successful algorithm for this is the Kalman filter. Extensions of the Kalman filter when the system jumps around a set of nominal operating modes have been developed, but they have been ad hoc procedures. Indeed, the IMM technology appears to be the current standard in the United States. The research will develop an exact filter obtained in previous work which provides improvements on the IMM, investigate Viterbi modifications and derive related smoothers. The results potentially have applications in many areas of communications, tracking and signal detection.



We shall also develop estimation results for point processes. With the development of optical communication technology this modeling is of increasing interest. Some applications arise quite naturally from observed data that is modeled by counting processes, for example, the arrival of photon packets, or even the arrival of email packets. Further, several counting processes admit a marked point process representation, where each count event is coincident with another event of interest. An example is an email process, where its point process could be the times of arrival and the mark process the number of bytes in each email event. Immediate communication applications here include observing email processes to estimate traffic character or parameter values.



Hidden Markov Models have been successfully applied in the sequencing of genes, and more recently proteins. We shall investigate further applications of our results in this area.

"The 'Working on Walls' (WOW) project provides a high level of both scientific and professional post-graduate training for carefully selected students and post-doctoral fellows who are interested in advancing our knowledge frontiers in basic and applied plant biology research. WOW trainees work on a very timely issue, in an intellectually stimulating and highly integrated multidisciplinary environment that both challenges and rewards them. Their training is customized to their professional and academic goals, and is overseen by both life science experts and professional educators. 

The scientific research focus of the WOW program is discovery of the mechanisms by which plants convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into the largest single biomass resource on the planet, plant cell walls. Despite the central importance of plant cell walls to Earth's overall carbon cycle, the detailed mechanisms by which plants produce and modify their walls are still only poorly understood. In the WOW project, teams of senior and junior investigators with a wide range of expertise use the most sophisticated research tools and techniques available to dissect the molecular processes through which simple sugars are assembled into complex polymers, and then organized, transported and deposited in precise locations outside the cell. These studies complement similar research efforts presently underway in the laboratories of WOW collaborators in Sweden, France, Japan and the USA, and WOW trainees are encouraged to carry out part of their own research in these cooperating institutions. New knowledge generated by the WOW project will make crucial contributions to our understanding of how plant cell walls are formed, what regulates their final shape and chemistry, and how these processes might be modified to improve the economic value and utility of the plant-derived biomass. At the same time, WOW trainees will benefit from an exceptionally rich and professional career-oriented mentorship that prepares them to assume leadership roles both in science and in society at large.

"Over the past few decades since Rachel Carson published her book, Silent Spring, models have become standard tools in the chemical evaluator's kit when assessing environmental hazard.

In Canada, models such as ChemCAN, EQC and RAIDAR, developed at the CEMC, are used. These models were developed for chemicals such as PCBs and are incapable of predicting environmental concentrations of chemicals that ionize or are surfactants. In this project, we will incorporate our newly acquired understanding of the extreme ionizing surfactant, PFOA, into a suite of environmental models developed at the CEMC. The resulting models will be capable of predicting environmental concentrations of not only PFOA but ionizing surfactants in general, without losing their ability to predict non-ionizing and non-surfactant chemicals.

"Environment Canada, the US EPA, European and International agencies have identified certain classes of chemicals which they consider to be emerging pollutants of high priority.  Little is known about the environmental fate of many of these species.  They are given their classification based upon the quantities being used, their projected long-term production, and concerns about potential persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity.  Within this list are a group of commercial products known as surfactants and surfactant metabolites, some examples of their everyday use include personal care, laundry products, and floor and surface cleaners. A typical example of these chemicals are nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs), a heavy-use surfactant that Environment Canada has declared as a CEPA Toxic (Environment Canada, Health Canada 2000), and called for its substitution by environmentally acceptable substances.  European authorities have recently revised their human and environmental risk assessments for these compounds.  As of January 2005, NPE was classified as a ""reproductive hazard"" and its use in European cosmetics and other consumer and industrial products was prohibited at levels above 0.1%.  Metabolites of NPE, such as nonyl phenol (NP) have been found in sediments and there has been concern that it could accumulate to harmful levels in the environment.  In the US, the EPA is establishing new water quality criteria that would limit the amounts of NP discharged into the environment.  Although surfactants, in general, are primarily emitted to local waste water systems, there is a precedent which shows that their unique nature will allow them to be emitted from the water to air.  This in turn would facilitate the potential transport of the surfactant to remote pristine regions.  The goal of this research is to develop techniques to analyze the physical properties of surfactants in order to fully understand their environmental transport potential, to investigate their atmospheric fate and deposition and to develop models to assess their Canadian and global dissemination.  It is envisaged that these studies will allow Canadian and world regulatory bodies to better assess the environmental impact of surfactants in general.

"Image-guided therapy uses medical images, 3D position sensing devices, and computer-based navigation systems to improve the ways in which physicians treat patients. Images, such as MRI scans, can be used before an interventional procedure (such as surgery or catheterization) to carefully plan the procedure in a 3D computer simulation. When the plan is aligned with the patient in the treatment room, the navigation system can sense where the patient and the instruments are, so that the physician can see an ""overlay"" of the instruments on the images, allowing the physician to access deep anatomical structures through very small incisions. Additional medical images, such as ultrasound, can also be obtained and integrated into the navigation screens. This gives physicians powerful information that helps them to treat patients more effectively.



This research is aimed at improving two aspects of image-guided therapy: providing physicians with stereoscopic views of the medical images, and aligning the planning images with the real-time images to fuse the different images into an easy-to-use whole. These techniques will allow physicians to significantly improve treatments and may usher in the next revolution in laparoscopic surgery: ""scar-less"" surgery that uses natural openings into the body and thus needs no skin incisions.

"At present materials are being engineered in response to specific product needs, e.g. increased stiffness which results in reduced weight, or improved corrosion resistance and fatigue lives. Examples of such materials are Advanced Composite Materials (ACM's) where the matrix (polymer, aluminum/titanium) is reinforced by fibres or particles of another stiffer material. While some of the mechanical properties are enhanced by the introduction of a second phase material (e.g. elastic modulus, ultimate strength, and corrosion or erosion resistance) other properties may be affected adversely (e.g. ductility, initiation of cracks, interfacial damage, micro-plasticity/creep, bond weakening under cyclic loading and resistance to temperature / environment). Thus a thorough investigation of the long-term behaviour of these advanced engineered materials is required before the full scope of their application can be assessed. 



It is the objective of this research proposal to evaluate the long-term performance of a few promising composite materials and to develop methodologies to predict their response when subjected to complex (multiaxial) monotonic,with hold-time, and cyclic loadings, and exposure to the natural environment. Our focus in this proposal would be on the fibre reinforced polymer matrix composites, since they are continuing to find new use in demanding applications.



The methodology to be employed will of a hybrid nature involving experimental investigation in nano-micro-meso-macro scales, and analytical and numerical modelling. This multi-scale approach is essential for understanding and prevention of damage, since damage initiates in a material's microstructure.

"This is a computational biology project based on algorithmic, mathematical and combinatorial optimization methods. We focus on different problematics related to the evolutionary study of multigene families. We will consider different optimization problems, study the theoretical complexity of such problems, develop appropriate algorithmic solutions and test them on simulated and real data.



Genes are the major building blocks of genomic sequences containing the information necessary to produce all the proteins and non-coding RNAs necessary for the cell machinery. The natural and systematic approach used for identifying genes in a set of different genomes is by sequence comparison using classical bioinformatics tools such as BLAST. Genes sharing homologous sequences are grouped in a multigene family. Understanding the evolution of such gene families is a fundamental problem that has several applications. For example, it can help to distinguish between orthologs and paralogs: orthologs are copies that are directly related through speciation, while paralogs are copies that have evolved by duplication. This is an important question for functional annotation of genes, as it is believed that pairs of orthologs are more likely to have similar functions. A natural way of distinguishing between paralogs and orthologs is to infer the duplication and speciation events from the phylogenetic tree of a gene family. This question has been widely considered in the case of a well established species tree. In this proposal, we will consider the more general case of an unknown species tree. We will also focus on a particular class of gene families: tandemly arrayed genes. They constitute a large fraction of most genomes and play important roles. We will consider different questions related to a Duplication/Speciation/Loss/inversion model of evolution for TAGs. We will apply our algorithms to the olfactory receptor genes in different mammalian species.

"Because of the complexity of global competitiveness, the rapid changes in technology, customer requirements and market conditions, there is a need to improve the effectiveness of manufacturing and design as they are essential for wealth creation. Furthermore, the future Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMS) will be designed at the outset for rapid change in structure, as well as hardware and software components, in order to quickly adjust capacity and functionality within a part family in response to sudden changes in market or regulatory requirements. The long-term success of today's manufacturing enterprises, which are encountering unprecedented challenges, is dependent on balancing human factors with manufacturing technology and other business considerations.  



This proposal is in the area of improving the effectiveness of design and manufacturing in a complex environment. The research deals with the problems of products design and manufacturing ""in the large"", in a system context as it relates to the challenges facing industry: the need for increased flexibility, responsiveness, environmental sustainability, and the ability to manage and control the complexity in a turbulent globally competitive market. The proposed research is an extension to the well established research program of the Applicant and his Master's and Doctoral students. Examples of outcomes  include training of HQP and the pioneering research already published in archival journals in the following areas: a) modeling the design and manufacturing complexity, including design, manufacturing and operational complexity; b) modeling and providing flexible manufacturing capacity in response to turbulent market demand, using a ""control theoretic modeling"" approach; c) modeling and prediction the expected quality for reconfigurable manufacturing systems, under various scenarios; and d) the initiation, with international colleagues, of a new engineering design paradigm for such a complex environment, namely ""Engineering Collaboration via Negotiation (ECN)"".

"Global competition and rapid changes in technology are putting manufacturers under pressure to create a new generation of production systems. These systems must encompass high level of manufacturing flexibilities such as capacity, product mix, and product flexibilities which will require developing appropriate modeling and solution techniques for scheduling and control.



The performance of a production system significantly depends on the availability of efficient rescheduling capabilities in order to deal with dynamic changes in real-time. A variety of conditions necessitate revisions to an existing schedule. Some of the common disturbances that call for rescheduling are: machine breakdown, rush order arrival, shortage of materials, over or underestimation of process time, order cancellation, and due date changes. The objective of this research is to develop rescheduling algorithms to deal with these sources of disturbances of the manufacturing system operation. Metaheuristic, heuristic and hybrid approaches will be considered for reoptimization of system's performance upon disturbance occurrence. A through comparison between these approaches will be conducted with respect to the obtained system performance and the needed solution time. 



The deliverable of the proposed research will be a novel approach of production scheduling optimization of manufacturing system in a dynamic environment. An important feature of the proposed research program is that it will deal with the development and implementation of various modeling and optimization techniques to real manufacturing issues.

"Radar cross-section (RCS) is one of the important parameters to detect complex targets in random media. Backscattering enhancement (BE) occurs when RCS in random medium like turbulence is double that in free space, this phenomenon is called double passage. There is a substantial difficulty in estimating RCS as a result of the deviation of the BE from the double passage effect. To overcome the prescribed phenomenon, RCS of the target can be calculated from different angles and the average can be taken of these values. This technique will be more powerful if we consider the time factor. In other words, to deal with real time detection, we need to calculate RCS of a target from different angles in parallel. In doing that, I propose to apply wireless network in the communication of a networked radar system (NRS). Connections among different sensors connected to computers that communicate are simulated to provide the average RCS at one time. Two separate problems will be investigated in this project: In the first problem, waves scattered from more complicated targets in random media will be investigated. It is aimed to extend the research of RCS and BE of nonconvex targets with large sizes. In this regard, the scattering problem will be handled by considering the different properties of the incident waves, targets, random media, and polarization of incident waves for 2D and 3D problems. In the second problem, the requirements will be analyzed for communication of a NRS based on a centralized processing model that is similar in its architecture to the client-server model. The system solution takes the form of a computing wireless network in which channels are chosen to give adequate response times and security of services. This network will link together a number of short-range tactical radars, each with associated data processing equipment. Proposed wireless switches are useful not only for civil communication traffic but also for military ones under the condition of congestion. On the other hand, the research on laser radar for target ranging, detection, and recognition has become the one key technology used to evaluate and model the characteristics of scattering from complex targets in the different applications.

"Historically, electricity production and supply has been performed by centralized, regulated electric utilities that owned and operated power generation facilities as well as the transmission and distribution lines. Recently, policies have encouraged the opening of the electric power system to entities other than the electric utilities.

This has created a competitive landscape for power generation and has opened the transmission system to access by paying users. While deregulation came with promises of liberating one important economic force, competition in supply, creating a new market environment for wholesale and retail electricity trading, cheaper electricity and better quality of service, it definitely brought lots of challenges that need to be addressed in order to achieve a more efficient national power grid.

Although it is generally accepted that centralized electric power plants will remain the major source of electric power supply for the future, Distributed Generation DG, can complement central power by providing incremental capacity to the utility grid or to an end user. Installing DGs on the distribution system can bring numerous advantages to customers, utilities and the electricity system at large.

Although technological advancements have made distributed generation a credible option for on-site generation, it is not yet fully integrated into the electricity system due to many barriers that are impeding widespread adoption of these technologies. If left unresolved, these obstacles will seriously hamper future market growth. Addressing those challenges is essential before the deployment of DG into the electricity system becomes a feasible task. The solution might require alteration to present distribution system practices in order to be able to integrate centralized and distributed generations. The objective of this proposed project is to

research possible ways to dilute those obstacles and facilitate effective integration of distributed generation into the electricity system in a way that achieves better system reliability, higher efficiency, enhanced power quality and lower environmental impact.

"With the significant progress in haptic technologies (Nintendo Wii (http://wii.nintendo.com/), iPhone (http://www.apple.com/iphone/), etc.), the incorporation of haptics into virtual environments is still in its infancy. A wide range of the e-society's human activities, including communication, education, art, entertainment, commerce, and science, would forever change if we learn how to capture, manipulate, and reproduce haptic sensory stimuli that are nearly indistinguishable from reality. For the field to move beyond today's state of the art, many commercial and technological barriers are to be surmounted. First, business models/frameworks are needed to make haptic devices practical, inexpensive, and widely accessible with an ultimate goal to make a haptic device as easy to plug in as the mouse in a computer. Moreover, multipoint, multihand, and multiperson interaction scenarios need further investigation to reach enticingly rich interactivity. Finally, we should not forget that collaborative touch and physical interaction are among the fundamental questions in haptic systems development. By rendering how objects feel through haptic technology, we communicate information that might reflect a desire to speak a physically-based language that has never been explored before. 

Building on the applicant's extensive expertise in multimedia communications, collaborative environments, and interactive Haptic Audio Visual Environments (HAVE), the main objective of this research program is to design and develop an ambient intelligent haptics based framework that would allow interactivity and Tele-presence in HAVE to be efficiently supported and managed on the Internet.

"Corrosion of steel reinforcement has led to high maintenance and repair cost for concrete structures especially those built in harsh environments. Recent research indicated that the individual concrete members (beams, slabs, and columns) reinforced with the non-corrodible fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composite bars behaved well under both monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. However, very limited work was conducted on the connections (joints) of these individual members to form a frame structure. Joints are required to function as restraint to adjoining column and beam members and develop their full inelastic capacity if necessary. Since FRP bars have a linear elastic behaviour till failure and show reduced strengths when bent or subjected to compressive stresses, there are concerns on the ductility performance and the integrity of such joints when FRP bars are use, especially under seismic loads. This research program will focus on investigating the behaviour of FRP-reinforced concrete beam-column joints. The research program consists of laboratory investigation and analytical modelling. Full-scale FRP-reinforced concrete beam-column joints (interior and exterior) will be tested in the laboratory. The test parameters will include the type of loading (monotonic or cyclic), the amount of confinement for the joint core (bar diameter and spacing of FRP stirrups), column axial load, concrete strength, FRP main reinforcement type and ratio, and detailing of reinforcement. Nonlinear finite element analysis will be used to model the complex distribution of stresses and strains at the joint panel in lights of the essential differences in mechanical properties and bond characteristics between FRP and steel bars. This model will be incorporated into a computer code, which will be calibrated against the experimental results. Then, the computer code will be used to perform parametric studies to investigate a wide range of factors that are expected to affect the behaviour of such joints. The test results will be formulated into design equations for ductile and integral beam-column joints. This research leads to new structures with improved performance, better durability and less life-cycle cost.","Construction, transportation and communications","Civil Engineering"

"Navigation technologies are expanding at a phenomenal rate, especially within the civil community, with devices such as vehicle and personal navigators becoming commonplace within our everyday lives. Most current navigation systems rely primarily on the Global Positioning System ""GPS"" for position and velocity estimates. But with the growing demand for solutions that works in harsh GPS environments, such as in downtown areas, under heavily treed canopies, or in the presence of jamming, the limits of GPS signal availability are being reached where the navigation solution becomes temporarily unavailable. To help provide a continuous navigation solution, Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) have typically been integrated with GPS. The applicant, and others research, have been involved with the development of integrated GPS/INS systems for many navigation application. Unfortunately most of the focus of these integrated systems has been for high precision applications (requiring high cost inertial systems) due to several factors: (a) The high cost of navigational or tactical grade inertial sensors (thousands of dollars), (b) The relatively large size of these high quality inertial units, (c) Government restrictions/regulations. The introduction of micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensors has helped minimize these factors. MEMS are inexpensive, they are small enough to be embedded within a handheld GPS receiver, the government restrictions are minimal and they are commonly used with single point positioning GPS (SGPS) without the need for precise updates. For civil applications, MEMS inertial sensors combined with SGPS represent an efficient and practical solution for navigating in harsh GPS environments. But the gains in cost, size and regulations come with a price in terms of navigation accuracy. MEMS have much larger error characteristics than their higher grade counterparts meaning that the integration strategy is paramount to the success and accuracy of these sensors. The proposed research will address several issues with the current integration scheme including tuning, temperature and residual misalignment errors for integrated MEMS INS/SGPS systems.","Surveying and photogrammetry","DAS - Engineering Selection Committee"

"The assessment of the sustainability of natural and human-made hydrological and environmental systems (e.g., restored watersheds, watershed infrastructure, urban drainage systems) relies mainly on mathematical modeling to allow for long-term simulation and presentation of the performance of the system in question. In this research, a hybrid modeling approach for hydrological systems will be developed. The hybrid approach is defined as a modeling system that includes or integrates multiple (at least two) models. These models can be physically based where sufficient knowledge of the physical processes should be available or data-driven models that can be employed when the knowledge of the physical processes is absent or incomplete. The proposed hybrid modeling approach and the resulting hybrid models will be evaluated in terms of their modeling accuracy, accommodation of various sources of uncertainty, and computational efficiency, which includes computational time and tractability as well as their impact on the final system management decisions. The proposed research will be validated and applied to a multiple case studies, such as, modeling the various hydrological process (eg., soil moisture content, actual evapotranspiration, runoff) in restored watersheds in northen Alberta and natural forested sites from the BOREAS project in Saskatchewan.



The proposed research is expected to address some major questions raised by the hydroinformatics community regarding the choice of various models for various problems, the possibility of benefiting from various modeling approaches, and developing a modeling framework that helps users and water resources managers go through the modeling and decision making process in a systematic and transparent fashion. The research will also have significant practical implications because it will provide a framework for assessing the sustainability of reclamation strategies adopted or proposed by the mining (specifically, oil sands mining in northern Alberta) industry. This will certainly have invaluable effect on the environment and the economy of the region.

"Enzymes mediate the majority of fundamental life processes.  An understanding of these processes at the molecular level thus necessitates structural and functional studies of the enzymes involved.  Such an understanding also establishes a basis for the design of biotechnologically useful catalysts as well as novel therapeutics.  Understanding how enzymes work involves determining their mechanisms, that is, the multiple-step reaction pathway used to transform reactants to products, and elucidating the roles of their constituent amino acid residues in determining this function.  The achievement of these two objectives requires proper kinetic analysis involving transient-state kinetic methods.  We are requesting an essential upgrade to an aging stopped-flow (SF) reaction analyzer.  This instrument enables the co-applicants to study the mechanism of a large number of enzymes by transient-state kinetic analysis.  Many of these enzymes degrade pollutants such as PCBs and N-nitrosodimethylamine.  Other enzymes we study, such as HsaD and the Isd heme-uptake system, are critical to disease-causing bacteria.  The long-term objectives of our research programs are to understand the molecular mechanisms of the biological processes involving these various proteins.  These studies also facilitate the development of novel biocatalysts and new antimicrobial therapeutics.  The requested software and hardware include replacement of an obsolete computer and operating system that are failing and cannot be upgraded, together with improved electronics, sophisticated data analysis software, and sequential mixing capabilities.  Our research involves using complementary approaches including steady-state kinetics, mutagenesis and crystallography.  However, proper structure-function studies of enzymes are simply not possible without transient-state kinetic analysis.  The SF instrument is unique at UBC, and possibly in Canada, as it is installed in an anaerobic glovebox and has several options to facilitate study of our particular enzymes.  Overall, the requested equipment enables experiments and analyses not currently possible and ensures that the SF instrument will be used for years to come.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Genes, Cells and Molecules"
"Microorganisms have evolved an astoundingly versatile armamentarium of enzymes to degrade the vast array of organic compounds that occur in the environment. These enzymes constitute an essential link in the global carbon cycle, and as such are critical to maintaining the health of the biosphere. In addition to their fundamental importance, microbial catabolic enzymes represent an enormous, barely tapped source of biocatalysts for green chemistry and bioremediation. Understanding the huge natural diversity of microbial enzymes, and engineering them, facilitates the development of biocatalysts for more efficient, environmentally friendly industrial processes. My research program aims to investigate the structure and function of microbial enzymes involved in the degradation of natural and man-made compounds. NSERC-funded research has focused on enzymes that degrade biphenyl and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), but has led to discoveries that impact health research (e.g., cholesterol degradation in tuberculosis) and the degradation of other compounds (e.g., explosives). Over the next five years, I propose to study three enzymes involved in degrading different pollutants: BphK dehalogenates PCB metabolites; acetonitrile hydratase degrades nitriles; and propane monooxygenase co-metabolizes N-nitrosodimethylamine, a groundwater contaminant and carcinogen. Each enzyme represents an important class of enzymes. Despite their importance, critical aspects of how these enzymes function remain unknown. The proposed research seeks to understand how the enzymes work (i.e., their catalytic mechanisms and roles of active site residues) and why they degrade some compounds but not others (i.e., the structural determinants of specificity). The results will provide fundamental insights into the molecular mechanism of important biological processes and facilitate their biotechnological exploitation. The research objectives will be achieved using a cutting-edge, interdisciplinary approach, including tools and methodologies unique to the Eltis lab. The proposed program provides students and postdoctoral researchers with a wide range of skills, thereby preparing them for careers in academia and industry.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Cell Biology"

"Several metropolitan regions in Canada, including Victoria, Vancouver, and Montreal, have experienced earthquakes in the past, and will most certainly experience earthquakes in the future.  An aging infrastructure and an increase in population density in these regions has led to an increase in the risk of significant damage to buildings, bridges, and utilities in the event of a large earthquake.  Recent earthquakes in California and Japan have demonstrated that concrete and masonry buildings constructed prior to the mid 1970's are particularly vulnerable to significant structural damage or even collapse.  But not all concrete and masonry buildings pose a threat to life safety and building owners are frustrated with the high costs of retrofitting large inventories of existing buildings, while engineers struggle to identify the truly vulnerable buildings likely to collapse in future earthquakes. Research is needed to help engineers and building owners faced with the challenging task of reducing the seismic risk from existing structures in our urban centres through seismic rehabilitation.  The proposed research will endeavour to remove obstacles facing the seismic rehabilitation of concrete and masonry buildings, thereby maximizing the reduction in seismic risk facing Canadians.  In particular, the research will focus on three topics designed to contribute to an improved understanding of seismic performance of existing buildings, thereby enabling the design of cost-effective retrofit strategies: (1) the influence of strength degradation on displacement demands; (2) the sensitivity of out-of-plane response of unreinforced masonry walls to in-plane shear damage; and (3) the effect of material deterioration on the seismic performance of existing buildings.

"During the past decade, experimental efforts have begun to give us an unprecedented look

at the complexity of the processes that occur within a living cell. Because of the

quantitative nature of much of this data, the time is now right to try to develop predictive

models for how cells carry out the necessary computations that are required for life. My

own research focuses on two specific areas of the quantitative modeling of biology, namely how do cells regulate the flow of chemical signaling information and secondly how do the biological networks responsible for the cell cycle generate stable oscillations. We use bioinformatics to make predictions for how the genes within signalling pathways are regulated transcriptionally by the given pathways. This allows us to map out a transcriptional regulatory network to examine how pathways auto-regulate themselves as well as which pathways partake in cross-talk. With respect to oscillatory biological networks, we study the network that regulates the Caulobacter cell cycle. This organism undergoes asymmetric cell division and hence its cell cycle is differentially regulated depending on the spatial location of the component molecules. We are analyzing this network for its underlying regulatory connections to gain insight into how it generates oscillations and to what extent these oscillations are maintained in mutant or different environmental backgrounds. These two problems form part of the larger aim of trying to learn the physical principles that govern how cells carry out the  computations that they require to survive.

"The contamination of groundwater by microbial contaminants (viruses, bacteria, and protozoa) is currently recognized as one of the most pressing international water supply problems.  Hence, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms and factors affecting the fate and transport of microbial contaminants in the subsurface is essential for the protection of public health from waterborne disease.  Little predictive capacity exists regarding the influence of geologic and climatic conditions on the transport and survival of microorganisms in subsurface environments. While many field and lab scale studies of particle/pathogen transport in the subsurface exist, field studies are often criticized for their lack of advancement of conceptual understanding, limiting their applicability to other sites/situations. Conversely, rigorous mechanistic studies are often conducted at the lab-scale with artificial waters/media and are often criticized for their lack of applicability to real environments.



Here, research is proposed to advance 1) the currently available field-scale knowledge-base by delivering comparative subsurface transport and survival data for target pathogens and potential surrogates and 2) mechanistic models developed at lab-scale, to describe subsurface transport and survival of pathogens and potential surrogates. While issues of pathogen/surrogate occurrence, health risk, etc. are important, the specific focus here is on known pathogens/surrogates and advancing knowledge regarding their transport and survival in the subsurface by investigating 1) critical subsurface environments and 2) elucidating concurrent impacts of several factors believed to control pathogen transport and survival. Riverbank (RBF or in situ) filtration environments (groundwater extraction wells with induced recharge from surface water) are the focus here because they are known to present potentially significant groundwater contamination risk (particularly when subsurface materials are coarse) and currently present significant regulatory and utility concern with respect to their capacity to act as a barrier against pathogen entry into drinking water.

"Plants are organisms that grow by the constant addition of specialized modules - organs like roots, branches, leaves, stem nodes, flowers and fruits. Obviously the addition and growth rates of the different modular parts must be carefully orchestrated. Like animals, plants use hormones to achieve the appropriate level of organization. One such group of hormones is the cytokinins, a family of about 25-30 related compounds. They are thought to encourage growth by stimulating cells to divide or process sugars more quickly. Cytokinins are very challenging to work with because of the numerous forms and extremely low concentrations at which they operate. I will study how cytokinins direct plant modular growth by perturbing the forms of cytokinins present and the balance of their production using four different systems. We know very little about how the different forms of cytokinin are interconverted; therefore I will be analyzing plants that have been genetically modified to silence genes that are thought responsible for converting high to low activity cytokinins. Secondly, I will use plants genetically engineered to accumulate unusually large concentrations cytokinin specifically in fruits to determine the role of those organs in providing the rest of the plant with cytokinin. Thirdly, to determine the activity levels of different forms of cytokinin in growing seeds, I will investigate their genomic response to forms of cytokinins that they usually do not make themselves. Finally I will investigate the potential impact that fungal infection has on cytokinin production and its role in causing tumors, which are essentially large and unusually strong growing modules. Results will be relevant to agronomists wanting know how to direct more plant resources into seed production, horticulturalists interested in changing traits like investment into branching or flowering or plant pathologists who want to understand infection processes. Above all, it will advance our state of knowledge about how plants grow.","Agriculture and primary food production","Plant Biology & Food Science"
"The aims of this proposal are to generate novel RSs through maize and barley breeding programs and evaluate

their human health benefits following ingestion.

Dietary and lifestyle-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes (T2DM), coronary heart disease, obesity and

colonic cancers are major causes of disability and premature death in westernised affluent societies and

emerging nations. Increased consumption of whole grain cereal foods reduces the risk of these conditions

substantially. In particular, resistant starch (RS) which is a component of dietary fibre makes an important

contribution to these benefits by reducing rises in blood sugar levels following ingestion (helping to control

T2DM and reducing factors associated with cardiovascular disease) and acting as a prebiotic, promoting a

healthy lower gut microflora and mitigating incidents of colorectal cancer. RS intakes are low in populations at

high risk of the diseases of affluence, and there is a case for increasing its consumption as an effective means of

improving nutrition for public health at the population level. Replacement of normal starches (which are the

most important source of energy in the human diet) with RSs in daily consumed foods represents an ideal

opportunity to deliver profound health benefits to broad sectors of the population in an acceptable form.

Physicochemical properties of RSs will be determined, and help determine their functionality as potential food

ingredients by Maple Leaf Foods Inc. The RSs produced as a result of this program will also be used as a

valuable source of research material to test hypotheses about the role of amyloplast protein complexes in the

formation of RS structures. Overall, this comprehensive and multidisciplinary study of RS will create novel

germplasm, expand our knowledge in key areas of both human nutritional health and the regulation of storage

starch biosynthesis in plants, and contribute to the improvement of public health.","Agriculture and primary food production","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Food and Bioproducts"
"Starch is the primary source of calorific intake for mankind.   As a commodity, it has wide application in the food and non-food sectors.  As a food-stuff, particular types of starch known as resistant starch (RS) provide additional health benefits because of their effects on the rate of glucose absorption into the blood stream and through a pre-biotic function in the large colon where RS contributes to dietary fibre with positive benefits for colorectal health.  Within the non-food sector it has many applications, including areas as diverse as the paper and board industry, biodegradable plastics, drug delivery, dry-wall manufacture, and as a replacement for hydrocarbon ingredients in paint.  Increasingly it is being used as a feedstock in the energy industry for the production of bio-ethanol as an alternative to fossil fuels.  Starch is a polymer made of glucose units joined together in linear chains with periodic branching giving rise to a highly organized, semi-crystalline, insoluble structure.  It is biological variation in the fine-structure of starch which gives rise to its diversity of application and functionality.  Despite its enormous significance for mankind, our fundamental knowledge of how it is made is still lacking to the point where we are not in a position to produce tailor-made starches for particular end-uses, other than through the use of significant chemical modification which often has deleterious environmental impact as a result of effluent by-products.  Starch synthesis is dependent upon the cooperative activities of a large number of enzymes.  The work described in this program of research will address basic questions about biochemical mechanisms which give rise to the coordinated interaction of the enzymes involved.  In particular, the higher order mechanisms which facilitate biosynthesis of the starch granule will be investigated, including the formation of large multi-enzyme complexes in vivo.  Understanding these mechanisms will provide increased opportunity for future biotechnological application.","Plant production and plant primary products","Plant Biology & Food Science"

"Research in the Emslie group is directed towards the synthesis and study of unusual or unique metal complexes which are of interest from both a fundamental perspective and for the development of improved catalysts and new types of stoichiometric and catalytic transformation. To this end, our NSERC funded research program is focused on the synthesis, properties and reactivity of: (1) Borane-appended late transition metal complexes, and (2) Non-carbocyclic thorium and uranium complexes. While quite distinct, the use of ligand rigidity to create a very particular metal binding environment is of central importance in both areas.

Research in area 1 involves the use of novel rigid ligands which incorporate both electron-donating groups and an electron-acceptor (a borane) arranged around a central metal binding pocket. Electron donor groups are selected in order to bind readily to late transition metals, thereby anchoring the metal in close proximity to the pendant borane. As a consequence of this unusual situation, a variety of bonding interactions between the borane and either the metal or the ligands bound to the metal can occur. Investigation of the properties and reactivity of the resulting complexes is of considerable importance to further our understanding of rare metal-ligand interactions, and for the development of new approaches in catalysis.

In research area 2, our focus is on exploring the utility of extremely rigid and planar non carbocyclic ligands in thorium and uranium organometallic and redox chemistry. This research is directed towards the preparation of highly reactive complexes, in understanding the factors which control complex stability and reactivity, and in the discovery of new catalysts and catalytic reactions. Catalyst design is of great importance for the preparation of new chemicals and materials (e.g. pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and plastics), and in the discovery of more efficient and environmentally friendly methods to prepare currently available chemicals and materials. Advances in fundamental understanding are of equal importance since they contribute to the knowledge base in chemistry upon which all future technologies are built.","Physical sciences","Inorganic & Organic Chemistry"

"It is well known that production of mechanical grades of paper poses operational and product quality challenges. In addition the industry in the west coast faces an acute shortage of good quality fibre. One action that can be taken to face these challenges is an integrated approach to research. For thispurpose UBC and the largest paper producer in BC (Catalyst Paper Corporation), created a team with two chemical suppliers (EKA Chemicals and Nacan products Limited). This effort will enable us to to bring recent advances in nano-structured silica technology from EKA and starch biopolymers from Nacan into efficient use in mechanical grades of paper. This is the collaborative advantage. 

Laboratory trial experiments will be conducted at the UBC Pulp and Paper Centre. The trials will attempt to simulate to the best possible extent industrial conditions and through an interactive approach with the industrial partners this knowledge will be transferred to practice at the paper mills.

"We are investigating how small, redox-active molecules such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) interact with metalloproteins and other biomolecules to control the functioning of cells. Excess H2O2 can harm cells and cause programmed cell death (apoptosis) involving the heme protein, cytochrome c. We are interested in the detailed chemical processes that trigger this event since an ability to control apoptosis is highly desirable in the treatment of stroke and cancer. Under normal conditions, cellular H2O2 levels are tightly controlled. Because of its ease of genetic manipulation, we are using baker's yeast in our search for new molecular mechanisms of H2O2 sensing and signaling. Our focus is the heme enzyme, cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP), which can detoxifiy H2O2 by catalyzing its reduction to H2O. We are investigating genetically modified yeast strains that produce CCP mutants or no CCP at all. We also study purified CCP and its mutants in vitro to better understand its mode of action in vivo. The goal of this work is to obtain chemical insight into how organisms respond rapidly to redox challenges that occur in an oxygen rich environment. Oxidative stress is a major contributing factor in aging and in age-related diseases. 



Nitric oxide (NO) influences key biological functions such as blood flow, neuronal signaling and the immune response. We would like to understand how NO chemically modifies proteins and hormones, which can have profound effects on their mode of action. For example, reversible S-nitrosation of protein thiols is a major form of cell signaling, and research in our laboratory focuses on metal-catalyzed processes that promote NO-transfer between thiols. We are also probing the chemical reactions of the one-electron reduction product of NO, nitroxyl (HNO). The proposed studies will increase our knowledge of the bioinorganic chemistry of NO, which is critical in understanding the molecular underpinnings of cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration.

"Human visual attention is studied using behavioral methods, with the experiments informed by research and theory in human physiology, psychopathology, and computational modeling.  Two distinct lines of research are outlined briefly as representative of the projects ongoing in the UBC Vision Lab.

    1. A very exciting recent discovery in this lab is the unique pattern of responding that occurs when a search is interrupted and resumed.  Instead of taking the usual � second between the onset of a display and a correct response, responses on subsequent looks occur with a mean of 200-300 milliseconds.  The frequency of these rapid responses is influenced by several factors, but the most important is whether the participant has formed a perceptual hypothesis about one of the search items.  This means we now have a way to quantify what a participant is expecting to see.  Proposed experiments examine the relations between spatial attention and the rapid resumption, as well as individual differences in a large-scale developmental study. 

    2. We constantly make attributions about others enduring traits, based on their appearance and movement.  It is time to examine this problem psychophysically. In this research, we present participants with avatars that convey realistic emotional expressions and movements. Participants rate the 'personality' of these avatars using standard scales. We have control over the frequency and combination of movements that the avatar faces make in a brief video. Experiments first assess the social aptitude of a large number of college students using a standardized autism spectrum scale.  We then relate these scores to an individual's sensitivity to clues regarding the apparent 'dominance' and 'affiliation' of the avatars. In a second step, we collaborate with colleagues to give these personality perception tests to high-functioning individuals diagnosed with autism.   This will help establish the validity of our approach to better understanding personality perception, as well as revealing how these individuals attribute personality to others.

"Computers have become pervasive throughout our society. By increasing productivity and mobility, as well as providing new avenues of entertainment, computers have been commonplace in professional and personal lives. The wide array of uses and applications of computers present numerous challenges to hardware designers.  In the last decade, the computer industry has begun to successfully integrate multiple processing cores on a single chip through improvements in manufacturing technology.  In previous decades, purchasing parallel computing equipment represented a massive financial investment for a corporation.  Today, parallel architectures are cheap enough to produce that they can be found in cell phones and laptops.  As a result, parallel architectures are rapidly becoming ubiquitous.  To leverage the computation power of these multiple cores, communication between cores or devices is essential.  As in any teamwork activity, the best progress is made when all team members are communicating frequently and working together; it is much the same with parallel computer architectures.  The work in this proposal looks at streamlining the communication between cores to increase its efficiency.  Communication between cores should be natural and intuitive; this work proposes to improve the mechanisms that carry out that communication. Improvement in communication for computer architectures will have a wide impact across Canadian industry; software productivity and application development time will be improved substantially.  



Our recent research has shown that communication performance plays a critical role in overall system performance.  Further, we have demonstrated that adapting the communication infrastructure to the specific communication behaviour of applications can be beneficial.  The long term goal of this project is to extend the hardware communication support to encompass a broader array of applications and behaviours.

"Mammalian diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) have an important role in regulating functions that are specific to higher organisms such as brain activity, immunological response and cell proliferation. Our studies on the properties of several forms of DGK will lead to a better understanding of their function and provide the ability to modulate their properties. This will have relevance for pathological states such as cancer. 

     DGKs function in signal transduction by down regulating the lipid messenger, diacylglycerol (DAG). The mammalian DGK family is comprised of ten isoforms. The current focus of this grant is on the isoform DGKe. DGKe is the only DGK isoform that has a hydrophobic segment. The epsilon isoform is also the smallest known mammalian DGK, with a mass of 64 kDa and having only two Cys-rich regions (C1 domains) and a catalytic domain. DGKe also differs from other mammalian isoforms of DGK in not having other domains involved in regulation of the enzyme activity. Additionally, only DGKe has specificity for DAG containing polyunsaturated acyl chains. Hormone stimulation can result in the activation of PtdIns(4,5)P2-specific PLC resulting in the production of arachidonoyl-rich DAG. This form of DAG will be the preferred substrate of DGKe. This isoform is highly expressed in brain and is known to affect brain function.

     We will evaluate the role of the hydrophobic, putative transmembrane segment of DGKe, as well as its adjacent cluster of cationic residues, in determining the properties of this DGK isoform. The work will include in vitro enzyme assays to determine the catalytic efficiency and specificity of DGKe mutants that have modifications in these segments of the protein. We will determine the affinity of mutated forms to membranes. In addition, using fluorescence microscopy of FLAG-tagged proteins, we will determine the topology of these proteins in intact cells. Finally we will transfect immortalized fibroblasts from knock out animals with DNA coding for the mutated forms of the enzyme and determine the extent to which these modified proteins can recover the lipid phenotype of the control cells. 

     This work will provide important new information about the factors that determine if a hydrophobic segment is transmembrane or not and what functional consequence this has on DGKe. We will determine which region of the protein is responsible for the arachidonoyl specificity of this enzyme and the relationship of the location of the enzyme in cellular membrane domains to biological function.

"With ever-growing public awareness of environmental quality and Canada's drive for environmental stewardship, research into mitigating air pollution and developing alternative sources of fuels are critical. The proposed capillary-inlet mass spectrometer will be applied to several projects focusing on reducing gaseous emissions from current and new hybrid automobiles and designing and developing new catalysts for hydrogen production. Its acquisition demonstrates a commitment to the growing need for research and development of technologies that result in improved air quality and alternative fuel research. For example, future emissions reductions from automobiles, both gasoline and diesel, require advanced, catalytic aftertreatment technologies and engine controls that account for catalyst performance trends. In order to design and maximize the efficiency of the catalysts, fast analysis of transient concentration changes of many varied species within the catalyst itself is needed. Hydrogen production from most sources require catalysts and these catalyst beds contain severe gradients. In order to design and optimize the catalysts and their distribution in a reactor, concentration gradients and degradation modes need to be determined. The proposed instrument/technique can run at the necessary frequency of data accumulation, and acquire data within the catalyst bed and reactor systems resulting in more complete analysis, for these new catalyst and reactor emission-controlling technologies. The mass spectrometer was chosen over other instruments due to its high data acquisition speed, ability to measure hydrogen and flexibility in probe location. The success of these programs and the training of the HQP involved will stimulate economic development and result in improved air quality in Canada as well as diversification of fuels for growing transportation and power requirements.

"Thin films of composite ceramic coating can be applied to standard engine materials to affect the heat transfer properties and therefore internal and external surface temperatures. The extent of these changes, or heat transfer characteristics, can be changed by adapting the coating formulation, which is a technology Fireball, the industrial partner, has been studying. New regulations for diesel engines require new catalytic converter technology to be applied. These catalysts require exhaust gas temperatures typically higher than those encountered in passenger diesel vehicles under normal driving conditions. In order to maintain catalyst efficiencies, the exhaust gas can be heated by running the engine hotter, but obviously at a fuel penalty cost. Thin film coatings could be a solution to minimize or eliminate this fuel cost, by decreasing the heat transfer through the pipe to the environment. Such coatings would need to be optimized for heat transfer minimization, but also be able to maintain its integrity in the corrosive exhaust gas environment. The integrity needs to be studied and findings used to optimize the coating formulation. Furthermore, the decrease in heat transfer needs to be quantified, with the increase in exhaust gas temperature measured and the improvement in catalyst efficiency as a function of that temperature increase also measured in order to understand the extent of the effect on emissions reduction performance and decreased fuel penalties. The objectives therefore include formulation testing under exhaust gas conditions, measuring exhaust gas temperatures as a function of coating formulation, and extent of catalyst efficiency improvement and fuel penalty decrease associated with the coating application. If proven, this technology can be applied on exhaust pipes for diesel engine applications, representing a very significant increase in the industry partner's customer base and employment potential.","Energy efficiency","Ontario Internal Decision Committee"
"Current predictions indicate that the use of diesel and lean-burn gasoline engines in passenger vehicles will

increase relative to today's gasoline engines due to their better fuel economy and reduced CO2 emissions.

Coincidentally, upcoming environmental policy throughout most of the world is imposing requirements for

significant decreases in tailpipe NOx, hydrocarbon, CO and particulate emissions from engines. New

technologies are therefore being developed for diesel and lean-burn gasoline applications, with specific

emphasis on NOx. As hydrocarbon, NOx and particulate must be controlled, technologies for each will be

present in the exhaust manifold.

Micro-kinetic modeling of these systems is typically the ultimate goal for those studying and implementing

new technologies. This avoids the cost prohibitive experiment-based testing method that would necessarily

include all engine platforms under many and diverse operating conditions to gurantee performance.

Unfortunately, catalyst testing methodology typically consists only of gas in and gas out species measurements.

A missing component is the measurement of the chemistry, reaction process and temperature changes in the

axial direction relative to flow. Incorporation of such information into system models enables physical

validation and improvements on any micro-kinetic model, or can form the basis for a new micro-kinetic model

of catalytic systems.

The University of Waterloo and General Motors of Canada (GM) propose a collaboration, where the unique

reactor abilities at UW will be used to develop system models at GM. This effort will optimize emissions

control catalyst efficiency thereby decreasing vehicle emissions and increasing vehicle fuel economy.",Environment,"RPP Internal Decision Cttee"

"The identification and rigorous analysis of the forces that drive processes of material evolution (plasticity, biological growth, aging, remodeling, motion of dislocations and vacancies, crack propagation, motion of phase boundaries) is the topic of a new and very active area of research generally known as the Mechanics of Configurational Forces. My activities in this field, summarized in a co-authored monograph recently published by Springer-Verlag, have led to the recognition of the interconnection between such forces and the theory of material inhomogeneity. The full implications of this relationship for the modeling of the time-dependent constitutive behaviour of materials at various scales (from the nano scale to the cosmological) are still to be well understood and exploited in important engineering and biomedical applications. I propose to continue my established work in the field of material growth and remodeling and, more generally, of the laws that govern the time-evolution of material behaviour. Moreover, it is proposed to extend these ideas by incorporating recent findings developed in ongoing research carried out in collaboration with colleagues and graduate students, such as our recent work on the Mechanics of Fractal Bodies, a fully fledged thermodynamical formulation of the problem of growth, inclusion of strain-gradient effects and the use of the theory of chemically reacting mixtures. During the next few years, we propose to: (i) carry out a numerical implementation of these formulations; (ii) in collaboration with Professor Walter Herzog (of our Faculty of Kinesiology), perform original experiments in both hard tissue (bone) and soft tissue (cartilage, muscle) to assess the validity of our models and to quantify the growth variables; (iii) continue exploring the ability of material models based on fractal ideas not only to represent the geometry of the phenomena at hand (such as vascularity), but to quantitatively express the underlying physical laws (such as fractal elasticity). The significance of the potential results of this research proposal extends beyond the immediate applications outlined.

"The proposed research is to investigate ways of enhancing ultrasound images so as to aid their interpretation by a medical professional.  Image enhancement algorithms will be designed to make differences between different kinds of tissues more visible, and to increase the difference in appearance between normal tissues and diseased tissues.  The enhanced images are called ""virtual histology"" images after the classical histology methods of staining and viewing tissues under a microscope which are used by pathologists to make diagnoses.  ""Virtual histology"" images will offer a new kind of information to medical professionals which will improve the accuracy and rapidity of diagnoses.  It may be possible to use ""virtual histology"" images to reduce the need for surgical biopsies to determine malignancy.  Invasive biopsy procedures could be replaced in some cases by a harmless ultrasound scan which is enhanced by ""virtual histology"" algorithms.  In the future, ""virtual histology"" images could be generated automatically by ultrasound machines at the time of examination leading to faster time to diagnosis for patients and allowing for low-cost early detection of pathologies.

"Significant advances have been made toward characterizing the basic neurobiological substrates underlying renewed drug seeking in rats.  Central to this effort are studies based on an animal model of relapse, known as the reinstatement procedure.  In this procedure, an animal is trained to perform a behavioural response for drug infusions.  Subsequently, the behaviour is extinguished by withholding drug, at which time the reinstatement of drug seeking is triggered by exposure to an event, such as a priming injection of drug, exposure to drug-associated cues, or exposure to a stressor.  An important factor to consider in the study of reinstatement is withdrawal duration. Indeed, the motivational and corresponding neurobiological factors affecting the propensity for reinstatement at one time following termination of drug taking may be very different than at another time.  The proposed experiments are designed to provide a systematic investigation of the relationship between anxiety responses and reinstatement of cocaine seeking as a function of withdrawal duration, and the corresponding neuronal processes.  The general hypothesis of the proposal is that the balance of activity within specific stress-responsive brain circuits, including those containing the neurochemicals corticotropin-releasing factor, noradrenaline, and dopamine, changes depending on time lapsed since the termination of cocaine self-administration, and these changes are reflected in behaviour, including the expression of anxiety-like behaviour and stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that there is a lack of correspondence between conditions that elicit anxiety-like responses and the stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking.  This work is important toward understanding the motivational factors that influence reinstatement responding at different times following the termination of drug self-administration and, more generally, toward clarifying the mechanisms mediating addiction, reinstatement, and drug seeking.

"Bark beetles are some of the most important pests of temperate forests. As the mountain pine beetle (MPB) has spread from British Columbia into Alberta, there is possibility that it will invade to the jack pine (JP) forest in western Canada. The probability of this invasion has increased as global climate changes is expected to promote warmer winter temperatures in northerly latitudes and higher elevations. If MPB successfully invades and survives in JP forest, it may spread across Canada and cause serious ecological and economical problems throughout the boreal forests. As a Canada Research Chair in Forest Entomology, in my research program, I will use MPB as a model system to study an insect invasion into a new ecosystem. Such investigations are timely because potential MPB invasion of JP forest could provide many new insights about insect invasion into a new habitat and host. The fundamental difference between the historical habitat of MPB and JP system is the presence of a serious defoliator, jack pine budworm (JPB), Choristoneura pinus pinus (Lep: Tortricidae), and absence of outbreak species of bark beetles in the JP system. In the proposed project, my students and I will evaluate several aspects of JP-MPB-JPB interactions. We will focus on the interactions between fungi associated with MPB and JP because fungi are important on MPB survival and establishment. We will also investigate interactions between MPB and JPB because both species will likely to interact on the same tree, although MPB will occur on stem and JPB will occur on foliage. Plant chemical defenses will be evaluated as possible mechanisms that influence the outcome of MPB-JP-JPB interactions because chemical defenses are important mechanisms for conifers against herbivores and fungi. Developing deeper understandings of how MPB invasion would affect the JP forest system will be important contribution of this project. Such understanding is important to elucidate the general structure and behavior of the JP system against MPB and will be critical for the development of the integrated pest management of MPB in the JP forest.

"The first part of my program is to investigate fundamental questions in the theory of lattices and geometry of numbers.  I have been able to introduce new methods into these classical theories, which in two instances resulted in answering question posed by Voronoi nearly 100 years ago.  I have also established links between some classical results in geometry of numbers and a variety of modern mathematical topics.  The long-range goal is to understand more clearly the geometry of lattices in higher dimensional spaces, such as 6, 8, or even 20.  



The second part of my program is to understand how phases are formed in solids.  Such phases change the material properties of solids in dramatic ways; examples are the super-conducting state, or the anti-ferromagnetic state.   I am developing new methods to calculate the properties of these quantum phases so that I can achieve a deeper understanding of how phases are formed.

"As more and more applications are generating and storing massive amounts of data, the processing of large data is becoming crucial in many fields.  In this proposal we are interested in processing large amounts of data in the presence of resource constraints. In particular, we would like to develop algorithms in the property testing, streaming, and sensor network aggregation models, allowing time and/or space sublinear in the size of the input.  Clearly, such tight restrictions imply that the solutions provided by our algorithms cannot be fully accurate in many cases; one of our goals is to explore the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency in these models. We will focus on problems related to properties of sequences, but will explore other areas as we develop more techniques.

This project targets the development of new technologies in the areas of motion controls, virtual prototyping, and printing integrated manufacturing. These technologies will improve the productivity and dynamic accuracy of multi-axis production machines and augment their functionality to produce new types of value added goods, by utilizing advanced ink-jet printing in conjunction with other types of conventional operations such as machining. The three fields of study, which are precision motion controls, virtual prototyping, and printing integrated manufacturing, are closely related to each other and will play complementary roles that support each other in the context of this project.

Virtual prototyping of multi-axis machines will enable new machine models to be developed, evaluated, and optimized without having to build costly prototypes. Precision motion controls will allow the accuracy and performance of existing machines to be upgraded, so that they can be used to produce higher quality goods in shorter cycle times, and at lower costs. The improvement of a machine's accuracy also allows new types of high-end functionalities to be incorporated, such as integrated inkjet printing. This capability will be explored for producing a variety of innovative value added products from materials like wood, metals, plastics, etc., which will benefit from the combination of printing and material removal operations in one setup. The proposed technologies will be developed in collaboration with a Canadian company which is active in the fields of motion controls, computer aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), and industrial inkjet printing. The scientific and engineering results will be incorporated into new products and services offered by the industrial partner, thereby contributing to its competitiveness in the international market. In overall, this project will contribute to Canada's economy, high-tech job creation, highly trained work force, and manufacturing industry.

"This project targets the development of new motion control and trajectory planning techniques that enhance the productivity and part quality in manufacturing operations carried out on multi-axis machine tools, robots, and electronic/optical fabrication equipment. New control methods will be developed which improve the high-speed positioning accuracy and dynamic rigidity of feed drives (i.e. moving axes) on production machines. Optimization techniques will be investigated that minimize the cycle time required to execute complex multi-axis trajectories smoothly, within the physical limits of the machine and manufacturing process.

   The research on structural control will focus on developing new methods capable of achieving simultaneous high-accuracy positioning and vibration damping using approaches like Adaptive Sliding Mode Control, H_2 and H_infinity control. The research on trajectory optimization will study heuristic, gradient-based, and interval analysis type techniques that can deliver shorter cycle times on 3- and 5-axis production machines, while maintaining the desired tool/part positioning accuracy. The developed control and trajectory optimization algorithms will be validated on ball screw and direct-drive systems built at the University of Waterloo. The research will be carried out in collaboration with Canadian companies involved in aerospace and automotive manufacture, computer aided design, and motion controls. This will enable the research results to be used in Canadian industry to gain technological and competitive advantages, which will ultimately benefit the economy.","Manufacturing processes and products","Mechanical Engineering - A"
"This is a proposal for research that concerns the study of certain objects called von Neumann algebras. These were first studied in the 1930's by John von Neumann in connection with quantum physics, and they are distinguished by the idea of continuous dimensionality.



In the 1980's,  using von Neumann's theory ---and in the course of a striking discovery linking the field of knot theory and statistical mechanics--- Vaughan Jones studied inclusions N in M of special von Neumann algebras called II_1 factors. He introduced an invariant for the inclusion N in M up to conjugacy by automorphisms: This is a real number, called the index for N in M, which enable us to distinguish pairs N in M that are not conjugate. Since then, more invariants were defined in order to attempt to characterise these inclusions.



The general objectives of this proposal are related to contructing and studying certain inclusions of hyperfinite II_1 factors by computing finite invariants.","Not available","Pure & Applied Maths - A"

"On a frequent basis, the Earth 'belches' and there is a sudden and major release of magma (molten rock) from the Earth's interior, which rises into the Earth's crust and partly spills out on the surface as lava flows. These Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) are truly immense in scale. The largest has a volume of magma of 80 million cubic kilometres, but  they more typically encompass about 1 million cubic kilometres. LIPs consist of a single pulse or multiple pulses lasting a million years or less, and occur in an intraplate setting; in other words they are not related to any plate boundaries.  LIPs cause extinction events, break up super-continents, and are the hosts for rich ore deposits. These events are so prominent in Earth history that they represent kind of a ""Heartbeat"" or ""Pulse of the Earth"" (www.nuna2007.ca; www.largeigneousprovinces.org). 

     Our sister planet, Venus, is rich with LIP style volcanism, such as huge volcanoes (up to 1000 km in diameter), enigmatic subcircular tectono-volcanic features called corona and vast plains of flood basalts. Like Earth, Venus also has major radiating dyke swarm systems which are part of the plumbing systems for the volcanism. However, on Venus, because of the absence of surface erosion, the dyke swarms are recognized by their surface expression as  graben-fissure systems. 

     Herein we propose having three M.Sc. students do detailed mapping and interpretation of graben-fissure systems in regions of Venus each about 14 million square kilometres. Our previous detailed mapping in neighbouring areas has revealed a wealth of previously unknown radiating systems of huge scale (up to >2000 kilometres in radius). 

     There remain fundamental controversies regarding magmatism on Venus, such as, was there resurfacing by a unique global magmatic event or steady state volcanism. We illustrate how the research of our M.Sc. students will address these and other fundamental questions regarding the LIP magmatic history and evolution of Venus.

"The general goal of this research project is the study of multivariate stochastic models with stochastic correlation and jumps and their quantitative impact in the risk of financial markets and the pricing of exotic products.

    Taking into account the joint behavior of different assets in the model would bring a better assessment of such risks and a more accurate understanding of some of the complex derivatives that financial institutions have issued in recent years. Such products have been mispriced in practice by the use of inadequate models. Consequently the under evaluation of risk in highly nonlinear portfolios containing multivariate derivatives is considered one of the main reasons of the current world financial crisis. This revealed to be particularly true in the ongoing crisis of the credit sector, where the incorrect evaluation of Collateral Debt Obligations (CDO's) provoked the bankruptcy of key institutions.

    We will examine properties of several novel multivariate processes driven by non Gaussian noises, computing expected values of certain functionals and describing their asymptotic behavior as stationarity, mixing and ergodic properties. Based on the asymptotic properties of these models, together with their Markovian structure, we will implement martingale estimating procedures via conditional characteristic functions (CCF), moments and approximations of the likelihood. We use these properties for calibration and testing of these models to real market data.

    We also consider the pricing of complex financial derivatives whose payoffs depend on the collective behavior of several underlying assets assuming the dynamic described by the models above. Basket and Spread Options, Mountain Range Derivatives and Collateralized Debt Obligations are our specific targets. Pricing expressions will be obtained by techniques based on the CCF, the Green function, the method of images and the analytical/numerical solutions of PDEs.

"In Canada approximately 388,700 tons of dry sewage sludge (biosolids) are produced yearly and existing waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) are expanding to serve the demand of growing cities, which will result in an increase of sludge production in the future. Furthermore, the quality of waste sludge is worsening as a result of the presence of anthropogenic micro-pollutants, such as heavy metals, personal care products, endocrine disrupters, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or dioxins, limiting agricultural and land reuse. New and practical WWTP sludge reduction approaches would not only reduce the operational and capital costs associated with sludge management and disposal, but also result in production of less biosolids and deleterious environmental effects when sent to landfill or agricultural land. This program builds on my expertise within the sludge line of MW pretreatment for sludge reduction, but shifts the focus of attention to wastewater line processes that lower sludge yield during wastewater treatment (one step earlier) rather than post-treatment after generation. The aim of this work is to study a hybrid (sonication followed by oxic-settling-anaerobic system) sludge reduction process as a viable technology for improved biodegradation and reduced sludge yield. The proposed research can be directly applied at the WWTP rather than in off-site post-treatments. The prior enhances biodegradation of sludge in aerobic/anaerobic bioreactors as a part of the carbon-oxygen cycle and leads to cost reductions in anaerobic biosolids digestion, dewatering, drying and transportation. Other benefits of this research will be improved sludge dewaterability and less biosolids returned to the environment as well as reduction of contaminants transferred to food crops grown on land and leaked into groundwater. If this research is successful, expansion of the sludge line treatment facilities (i.e., anaerobic digestion) could be delayed and Canada would be at the forefront of innovative wastewater line sludge minimization technology.

"Heat treatable aluminum alloys have been widely used as one of the most important classes of engineering materials due to their combinations of desirable properties. These alloys can achieve high strength levels if their hardening capability is suitably exploited. This potential is of tremendous importance for automotive panel applications where the alloys can be hardened during paint baking processes. Such processes use cost-efficient routes with short heating times and low temperatures, during which the alloys undergo structural changes at nanometer scale. A deep understanding of these changes and the effect of manufacturing parameters in dictating the direction for these changes can provide the necessary tools for optimizing processes and maximizing the strength of the finished products. Recently, magnesium alloys have also attracted significant attention for the design of lightweight structural components, as well as degradable biomaterials. A number of currently-produced Mg alloys are heat treatable and have shown hardening capability. However, a thorough knowledge of the effect of processing on their hardening behaviour is lacking.



This work is designed to investigate the early-stage structural evolution during heat treatment and its effect on subsequent hardening in selected classes of heat treatable Al and Mg alloys. Advanced materials characterization and analytical modeling activities will be employed to achieve in-depth knowledge and prediction capability for tailoring of processing, structure, and properties in these alloys. The results of this study will pave the way for future innovations in the design of novel ultrahigh-strength light alloys, as well as novel cost-efficient manufacturing routes. The technological advancement that will be built on the present work will contribute directly to the competitiveness of leading Canadian industries such as Novelis and Rio Tinto Alcan, as well as the initiation of future leading-edge magnesium-based biomaterials establishments. Canadian academia and industry will also benefit from the associated training of highly qualified personnel.

"The overall objective of the proposed research program is to develop an innovative approach for optimum vibration suppression of flexible structures. Commonly used passive vibration absorbers become de-tuned over time due to the structural variations. In order to compensate for these deviations, active vibration control schemes are needed. These techniques, however, suffer from the control induced instability in addition to the large control effort requirement. Utilizing concurrent use of semi-active and active subsections, an intelligent semi-automated alternative is suggested. The semi-active subsection includes smart structures ranging from ER/MR dampers to magnetostrictive actuators, and a particular set of piezoelectric actuators forms the active subsection. By altering the adjustable structural properties (in semi-active unit) and control parameters (in active unit), a search is conducted to minimize an objective function subject to constraints, which may reflect performance characteristics. In practice, an engineer in-the-loop interprets the resulting performance and may initiate a number of options: control optimization, semi-active component optimization, or combination of the two. The predominant activity of the proposed study will be to develop and facilitate this interpretive decision making via numerical tools. The vibration should be suppressed to the possible extent using a semi-active unit (the least power consuming effort) through proper adjustment of smart materials, while the active absorber unit handles the remaining vibration suppression requirement. If the resulting design is not acceptable or if system parameters show variations, an interpretation procedure triggers to alter the parameters of the semi-active unit, or retune the control parameters of active unit, or concurrently adjust both. These features are very important and will broaden the utility of the vibration absorbers in industrial applications where a wide range of structural variations is encountered. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated through the simulations of a SDOF system. The challenge lies in the development of intelligent decision-making processes for hybrid treatment when implemented on realistic systems with complex dynamics and controllability.

"We will focus on fundamental formulation and computational issues for accurate and consistent finite element simulation of transient elastic structures undergoing large deformations and displacements (geometrical and material nonlinearities) induced by the flow of viscous incompressible fluids. We will continue to study and develop the 3D aspect of the monolithic Fluid-Structure Finite element method. For this to be a success as it is for our previous 2D unsteady monolithic development, special attention will be paid to 1) the impact of 3D on the Geometrical Conservation Law (GCL) and temporal accuracy, 2) the fully coupled implementation of high-order L-stable Runge-Kutta schemes that will save computational time, 3) extension of these time integrators to coupled Fluid Structure Interactions (FSI), 4) the stabilization with Taylor-Hood elements for High Reynolds number simulations and 5) the performance of sparse direct solvers applied to monolithic  FSI.

The adaptive methodology will be extended for time problems on deforming grids to improve the CPU time and memory to accuracy ratio.

We will compare with Space-Time Finite Element Methods since they naturally satisfy the GCL. We will assess CPU time efficiency, space accuracy and implementation difficulty.

We will apply this methodology to the design, caracterisation and optimisation of underwater structures (offshore pipes, risers, anchor lines, propulsion and power extraction devices, nuclear steam generators to name a few) which requires the monolithic treatment of Fluid-Structure-Solid Interactions.

The impact of this work is two-fold.  First it provides generic knowledge advances on the modeling of fluid-structure interactions. Secondly it provides new tools to address central questions that affect competitiveness of the Canadian hydrodynamic industry and economic benefit.

"Of interest to geneticists is the identity and impact of genes that cause reproductive incompatibilities.  Another important molecular genetic question asks how polyploid organisms maintain crucial phenotypes, such as sex determination, in the wake of complete genome duplication.  The proposed research will employ polyploid clawed frogs (Xenopus) to investigate the abundance and effect of genes involved with reproductive incompatibilities and also to narrow down the genetic region that determines their sex.  We will utilize the considerable technical resources available for this group, including a complete genome sequence, expressed sequence tag databases, and prefabricated microarray chips.  We will also utilize and explore natural characteristics that make these frogs amenable to genetic inquiry, including the production of viable hybrids and backcrosses, and differential expression of paralogs formed by polyploidization.  Our specific goals are to (a) use phenotype association mapping to further narrow down the sex determining region of clawed frogs, (b) quantify the number and effect of genes that cause reproductive incompatibilities between species, and (c) test for a correlation between expression divergence and fertility of backcross hybrids.  Results of this work will have implications for our understanding of gene and genome duplication - fundamental genetic processes that occurred throughout the tree of life including in human ancestors.  This research will also identify genes with male-biased expression, elucidate the genetic basis of reproductive incompatibilities between species, and provide a genomic framework for study of sex determination after genome duplication.  This work will train graduate and undergraduate students at McMaster in NSERC priority areas including molecular genetics, functional genomics, bioinformatics, and computational biology.

"Viruses have been participating in an evolutionary duel with the organisms that they infect over a time span that probably goes back to the origins of life on earth.  This has led to the evolution of an extraordinarily complex network of host defenses and virus counter defenses, which collectively determines whether or not a virus can establish an infection.  By studying how virus-encoded proteins interact with host proteins, we gain new insights into how these cell systems function and new strategies for preventing or treating virus infections.

     This research concerns poxviruses.  These are large DNA viruses that can cause severe diseases in humans and animals and we use as experimental models vaccinia and myxoma viruses.  (Vaccinia was used as a vaccine against smallpox and myxoma causes myxomatosis in rabbits.)  Our studies consist of three different aims.  First, we have discovered that poxviruses encode proteins that increase the intracellular levels of a highly reactive form of oxygen called superoxide.  Superoxide plays a role in regulating cell growth and can inhibit processes that lead to cell death.  However, it's not known how this works.  We have isolated cell lines in which methods other than virus infection are used to upregulate the concentration of superoxide, and we will study what effect this has on cell growth, intracellular signaling, susceptibility to virus infection, and resistance to cell killing.  Second, we strongly suspect that poxviruses are messing around with superoxide levels because this affects the activity of cell growth signaling networks. Curiously, these systems are often also mutated in cancer cells and it may explain why myxoma virus can grow in human tumors but not in normal human cells.  We will use a method called RNA interference to separately block the activity of >900 enzymes regulating cell signaling, and see how this affects myxoma growth.  Finally, these methods can be extended to explore which of the more that 22,000 human genes play a role in supporting, or thwarting, poxvirus growth.  We will use our newly established high-throughput robotic screening facility, and large libraries of small interfering RNAs, to survey the whole human genome for genes that play a role in vaccinia virus replication.

"This research program aims to investigate macroevolutionary patterns in large-bodied terrestrial vertebrates, specifically Late Cretaceous ornithischian (plant-eating) dinosaurs, and evaluate their relationship to climatic and environmental change. This programs will integrate comparative anatomy, ontogenetic growth, and phylogenetic systematics of ornithischian dinosaurs with emerging paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental data to evaluate the role of climate and environmental change on patterns and processes of terrestrial vertebrate evolution, life histories, historical biogeography, and morphological and taxonomic diversity.

   Fieldwork associated with this program will build upon and extend knowledge of the biogeographic and biostratigraphic distributions of dinosaurs and other organisms in the Milk River area of Alberta and the Bonnet Plume basin of the Yukon Territory, Canada. Both fieldwork projects have significant potential to reveal new faunas and extend our knowledge of these paleontologically poorly known regions. 

   This research program incorporates significant student training at all levels. Research in this program will provide a better understanding of patterns of dinosaur evolution, biogeography, and diversity leading up to the end-Cretaceous extinction event, and will contribute to our knowledge of terrestrial ecosystem evolution.

"Air pollution has a major impact on the health of Canadians that, in Ontario alone, costs an estimated at $8 billion dollars annually. Particulate matter has been implicated as one of the major air pollutants causing this illness. However, very little is actually known about which chemical or physical characteristics of the particulate matter are causing these adverse health impacts. It is believed that following inhalation of particulate matter, our body responds at a cellular level triggering a cascade of biological processes that lead to the impact that we experience, impacts that range from discomfort in breathing to fatal heart attacks. In addition, particulate matter from some sources is likely much more toxic than that from others. Hence studying the relationship between particulate matter composition and cellular response, at locations where the particulate matter is expected to be more toxic or concentrated, will provide a key link between our health and our environment. The overall goal of this collaborative health research project is to develop a transportable system for exposing lung cells to particulate matter at different locations of interest. The system will separate the particulate matter by size into two fractions prior to contact with the cells. The first fraction, called the ""fine"" fraction, will contain the particles smaller than 2.5 mm in diameter (PM2.5) whereas the second fraction, called the ultrafine fraction, will contain particles that are over 100 times smaller.   This sized based distinction is very important, as these fractions are quite different both in the environment and in our bodies. We will use it this system to explore the biological response of cells when exposed to different concentrations of particulate matter and to assess different locations in which the particulate matter is believed to be more hazardous. The project will bring together a multidisciplinary team from medicine, engineering and science, along with collaborators from different levels of government. The understanding arising from this project will support the development of more effective air quality and emission regulations so as to protect the public without unnecessarily constraining economic growth.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","Collaborative Health Research Projects Selection Panel"
"Aerosols play key roles in climate and air quality.  Though microscopic in size, aerosols have monumental impacts on our environment and health. Nevertheless, scientific understanding of the mechanisms through which aerosols manifest these profound impacts is still in its infancy.  Only recently have novel instruments and inter-disciplinary collaboration offered the opportunity to make ground breaking progress in this field.  Many of the impacts of aerosols are geographically distinct to Canada. Yet Canada is lagging behind the world's scientific communities in this rapidly evolving field. NSERC funding will provide essential support for an integrated multidisciplinary research program investigating key interlinked aspects of aerosol science.  Studies on three broad topics will be pursued, formation, transformation and exposure, all involving field measurement as an over-arching theme. The research will examine the processes underlying the formation of ultrafine particles in urban and rural environments, with a focus on their release from vehicles. These smallest aerosol particles, less than 100 nm in size, are hypothesized to be contributing to a range of adverse health impacts. The exposure of urban populations to ultrafine particles will be measured for key activities and microenvironments (e.g. cooking, vehicles, public transit) and modeled in terms of roadside, and within neighbourhood, concentration gradients.   The toxicity of the particles, for different activities and locations, will be evaluated and related to their size and composition. Measurement and modeling will be used to identify the major sources impacting Canadian cities. The chemical transformation of particles as they age will be explored and interpreted in terms of spatial or time related variability in their properties, with their influence on global warming due to increased absorption of sunlight as one application.  This NSERC funding will help Canada develop knowledge and personnel needed to support critical environmental decision-making and policy development relating to aerosol science over the next decade.",Environment,"Anal. & Phys.

"For fifty years, the magnetic properties of geological and archaeological materials have proven to be a rich source of information concerning our planet's history and dynamics. The switching of the north and south magnetic poles (geomagnetic polarity reversals), the creation and destruction of the ocean floor and the resulting drift of the continents (plate tectonics), the waxing and waning of the great ice sheets (past global warming -- and cooling) are prime examples that spring to mind. And yet there remain serious shortcomings in our understanding of the basic physical mechanisms that lead to the capture of these signals. One of the knotty problems involved is that of interactions between the individual magnetic crystals in the various natural archives in question. These complicate the magnetic properties so much that in his classic papers Louis N�el (Nobel Prize in Physics 1970) wisely avoided this problem by considering a dilute assemblage of tiny non-interacting magnetic particles. Unfortunately, the minerals of interest (iron-titanium oxides) often occur as nanometre-scale intergrowths in which magnetic regions lie in close proximity to one another. Three recent developments make it possible to undertake a renewed attack on this problem. First, electron microscopy is now able to provide detailed images of the magnetic field pattern inside samples of interest. Second, vastly increased computing power now makes it possible to calculate the behaviour of arrays of interacting magnetic particles. Third, the development of new laboratory techniques provides a direct experimental measure of the strength of the interactions. In addition to these mineral physics studies, palaeoclimatic and archaeomagnetic investigations will also be carried out. The former will involve samples already collected from several sites around the world and will attempt to elucidate the mechanisms by which climatic information is magnetically encoded in natural sedimentary archives. The latter will involve new samples collected from archaeological structures in Iberia and Egypt in order to extend the geographic coverage of earlier campaigns in Greece and Italy.

"Finding meaning in biological data typically requires a search for common patterns. Finding features that are common to or distinguish sets of biological patterns helps us to determine the function of features, classify the structures, and make hypotheses for future experimentation. However, we must find these features by analyzing large amounts of complex data, so we need innovative computational techniques for comparing this data to extract relevant features.



Biological structure data includes both the 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional structures of molecules and the network structures formed by the various types of molecular interactions in the cell. Both have important functional properties that can be found by using information about similarities between structures, and linking preserved features to other common characteristics. Since the information about molecular structures and interaction networks is very complex and difficult to compute with, advanced techniques for their comparison need to be developed. This research will find new computational methods for finding these similarities, and also define appropriate models for measuring similarity. These models will be developed using knowledge about what types of similarity are relevant for the underlying biological data. Since these comparison problems are intractable in general, specific restrictions need to be determined that will make efficient algorithms possible; which of these restrictions are both needed and relevant will also be investigated. Being able to find these patterns will help decipher the underlying structures and networks, make good hypotheses about biological function, and enable inferences to be transferred between organisms. This research will also discover limitations on computational techniques for these problems.

"There is long-standing desire amongst users of timber for clear coatings that will maintain wood's visual appeal and protect the wood from environmental degradation. Clear finishes transmit light by definition, and photodegradation of wood beneath the coating results in a loss of interfacial adhesion between the wood and coating. This leads to failure of clear finishes on wood after 2-3 years outdoor exposure. The addition of UV absorbers and light stabilizers to clear coatings can increase their durability, but the performance of such systems still falls far short of what consumers want. It seems increasingly likely that consumer expectations will only be achieved by optimizing the coating system and also making radical changes to the wood substrate to reduce its susceptibility to photodegradation. Such a holistic approach may be able to increase the durability of clear coating systems to the desired level whereas it is difficult to see how conventional approaches to either coatings formulation or wood treatment could produce the necessary improvements. The proposed research will adopt this holistic approach by developing novel photostabilizing systems for wood and synthesizing meta oxide additives to significantly improve the durability of aqueous acrylic dispersions on wood. Integration of the most promising photoprotective treatment and clear coat should create a durable clear finishing system for wood that can match the high expectations of consumers. A solution to the problem of the poor resistance of wood to the weather and the development of highly durable natural finishes for wood could have a dramatic impact on the demand for Canadian timber as well as providing obvious commercial opportunities for durable clear coatings and photoprotective primers and treatments.","Wood, wood products and paper","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"

    Lean-burn natural gas engines offer higher efficiency and lower exhaust emissions compared to conventional stoichiometric homogeneous charge engines. However, as the mixture is leaned out beyond the lean limit of combustion, the stability of engine operation is reduced, and emissions increase sharply.  To extend the lean-limit of natural gas combustion, a unique partially stratified-charge (PSC) engine control concept has been developed. This new system provides enhanced ignition and combustion in lean-burn engines, resulting in reduced exhaust emissions and increased thermal efficiency. Initial ""proof-of-concept"" testing has shown that the PSC system provides increased engine stability and lower exhaust emissions compared to conventional homogeneous charge engine operation.  The overall objective of the research being proposed is to develop a better understanding of how the PSC ignition technique can be used to improve the performance of low-emission natural gas engines.  The proposed research will include fundamental experimental work as well as numerical studies to develop a more complete understanding of the fuel-air mixing, ignition, and combustion processes that take place in an engine equipped with a PSC ignition system.  The results of these fundamental studies will guide further development of the PSC technique for commercial application in large lean-burn stationary engines used to drive natural gas compressors.

"Catastrophic landslides (defined here as those landslides with a volume of 100,000 cubic metres or more and that have a mean velocity of 5 metres/second or greater) and their secondary effects (landslide dams and landslide tsunamis) have been responsible for some of the world's major historical natural disasters. The proposed research will investigate the complexity of catastrophic landslide processes by investigating initial failure mechanisms, runout behavior, and river damming potential. Catastrophic landslides frequently result from an initial failure being transformed by the addition of water and/or material from its path, into a very fast mass movement of the flow type. Surprisingly little is known about the engineering behaviour of catastrophic landslides, the processes of their formation and transformation, and the magnitude and frequency of their occurrence. With respect to landslide dams little systematic work has been carried out on the topographic controls on landslide damming. Building on significant recent progresss by the proponent, the research will attempt to fill these knowledge gaps by utilizing field investigation, the analysis of digital terrain data (including that acquired in the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)) and remote sensing imagery, thus providing the basis for the accurate characterisation of catastrophic landslides for engineering analysis and contributing toward enhanced landslide hazard assessment in Canada and worldwide.  With respect to losses due to catastrophic landslides, controls on their destructiveness and the determinants on loss magnitude will be explored as a gateway to enhanced landslide risk assessment. In particular the linkage between catastrophic landslide behavior and the magnitude and frequency of landslide losses will be investigated and physical-based parameters relating to destructiveness will be developed. This approach constitutes a new process-based conceptual framework for the study of catastrophic landslides worldwide that combines an examination of landslide behavior and the analysis of losses resulting from their occurrence.

"This application proposes to use biophysical techniques of 'x-ray crystallography' and 'surface plasmon resonance' to study the structure and binding of 'germline' and 'matured' antibodies to carbohydrate antigens.  The specific recognition of carbohydrates by antibodies is a critical aspect of immune surveillance for microbial pathogenesis and diseased tissue.  The antibody response in a new-born organism is composed largely from antibodies constructed from inherited, or 'germline,' gene segments that are subject to natural selection based on pathogen prevalence.  This is a critical consideration for antibodies specific for carbohydrate antigens as they generally do not stimulate an immune mechanism called 'affinity maturation' that generates highly-specific and tightly-binding antibodies.  The resulting germline antibodies have relatively low affinity to carbohydrate antigens, which has limited the study of the three-dimensional mechanisms of specificity of anti-carbohydrate antibodies and there exist just a few reports of the structures of antibody fragments in complex with carbohydrate antigen.

        An interesting property of germline antibodies is that they can act as a 'starting point' in the production of affinity-matured antibodies, and so in addition to the specificity that all antibodies must display toward their antigens germline antibodies must also exhibit enough flexibility to recognize a range of similar antigens that might be displayed by a number of pathogens.  We have selected from a large library of monoclonal antibody clones several near-germline antibodies that recognize different carbohydrate epitopes based on a sugar commonly found in bacteria.  We have showed for one antibody how one part of the binding site recognizes a single residue of bacterial sugar while the rest of the binding site can accommodate a range of substitutions on that sugar.  It is our hypothesis that this is a common scheme for germline antibodies, and we propose to investigate the structures and binding properties of a number of antibodies that bind bacterial carbohydrate antigens.

"An event-related potential (ERP) is a brain response associated with a stimulus, memory, attention, or a motor act. ERPs can be measured relatively easily by using electroencephalography (EEG), a method that measures electrical activity of the brain through the skull and scalp. ERPs are obtained by averaging the ongoing EEG activity of hundreds of trials so that random brain activity is averaged out and the relevant brain activity remains. ERPs have been used for several decades and numerous articles have appeared in Nature, Science, Neuron and other leading journals. Surprisingly, the neural processes that underlie the various ERP components are still poorly understood.  A major obstacle has been our inability to record the activity of single nerve cells in the brain together with the ERPs on the scalp. To address this problem, we have developed a nonhuman primate model to fully understand the relationship between single neuron activity and ERPs. Here, we are requesting an electrophysiological recording system that will allow us to record the activity of single nerve cells in multiple brain areas together with high-density ERPs. The experiments that are possible with this recording system will advance our understanding of the neural origin of various ERP components.

"Research over the past 50 years has demonstrated that the primate cerebral cortex contains more than 30 specialised visual areas. An important principle that has emerged from research in the visual system is the anatomical segregation of cortical areas involved in specific functional aspects of visual processing. The visual system seems to be organised into at least two separate pathways that both originate in the primary visual cortex. A dorsal pathway projects through the parietal cortex whereas a ventral pathway projects through the temporal cortex.  According to an influential model, the two systems are assumed to act independently. The dorsal action stream provides flexible control of phylogenetic old subcortical visuomotor modules for the generation of motor acts, while the ventral ""perception"" stream provides the rich and detailed representation of the visual world required for cognitive operations. Although this hypothesis has been supported by numerous psychophysical and neuropsychological studies, several recent findings suggest that the visual streams may interact more often than expected from this model. The strongest evidence for an interaction of the two visual streams has come from studies that have demonstrated that faces act as potent targets for movements of the eyes and that the gaze direction of a subject can influence the motor preparation of the eye movements. This is surprising as the temporal lobe is involved in high-level visual processing, including the processing of faces, whereas areas in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe and midbrain are involved the generation of fast eye movements. In this research project, we will investigate the neural mechanisms that lead to the effects of faces on eye movements.

"Database integration is an increasingly important research area: Information systems development requires integrating existing systems and their databases; data warehousing requires the integration of data from multiple transaction processing systems for decision support; electronic business between organizations requires the integration of trade partners' business data for efficient business processes and communication; inter-agency information sharing in e-government requires integration of citizen data. Thus, improvements in database integration techniques have a wide range of applications and can benefit a variety of users.



Database integration is a process with multiple steps, leading from the identification of the databases to the testing of the integrated system. The central step of this process is the identification of database elements that are similar to each other. This step is called schema matching.



Human users perceive schema matching methods as successful when they match database elements according to the same similarity criteria that the users would apply. Many automatic software-supported schema matching methods have been proposed, using a range of different notions of similarity. However, existing research has paid little attention to empirical work: There is little knowledge of how human data integrators judge the similarity of database elements. A recent study has shown that a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach does not apply and that human notions of similarity are strongly affected by the database integration context. 



The proposed research is a study to systematically examine how human database integrators carry out schema matching. It will identify how context influences the schema matching process and outcomes. This knowledge will then be applied to implement a context-aware schema matching method.



Context information is important to schema matching, but has been neglected by existing research. The use of context information in schema matching can have benefits to research and practice in areas such as information systems development, data warehousing, e-commerce, and e-government.

"In order to make better weather forecasts, it is essential to provide the computer with the best description of the current weather situation.  Because we cannot measure all atmospheric parameters such as temperature and humidity everywhere for the whole atmosphere from the surface up, we rely on a combination of observations and physical relationships between the different atmospheric parameters to get the best picture of the current weather situation.  This technique is referred to as data assimilation.



Although data assimilation is done more and more often, it is not clear that we are doing it the best that we can.  Are the best combinations of observations used?  Should we use other instruments instead?  Are we using observations over too short or too long a period?



In this work, we will simulate the process of data assimilation using a computer-based approach to investigate what types of observations do the best job at describing the atmosphere as completely as possible.  We will simulate how existing and planned instruments help in this process or not.  Finally, we will use the results of this simulation to demonstrate using real observations and weather forecasting that we have determined the best combinations of instruments to perform data assimilation.

"Despite an increased awareness of the importance of crop diversification for the long-term sustainability and success of agriculture in Canada, few plants are cultivated for the production of high-value, metabolite-based bioproducts. Two of the world's most important natural product-producing plants are Papaver somniferum (opium poppy), which accumulates the alkaloids morphine, codeine and thebaine, and Cannabis sativa (marijuana, hemp), which produces psychoactive cannabinoids and is used as a source of high-quality fiber and oil. The domestic market for codeine, morphine and oxycodone, which is derived from thebaine, is in excess of $100 million annually, all of which is currently imported. Canada has a well-established research capacity to support the development of new crops cultivated for the production of valuable bioproducts, such as Pharmaceuticals and fibers. In partnership with Prairie Plant Systems, Inc., (PPS) we will establish genomics resources, state-of-the-art metabolomics technology, based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), and an effective functional genomics initiative, based on induced mutagenesis and TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) for opium poppy and cannabis. This project will aim to identify biosynthetic genes for use in the metabolic engineering of opium poppy to accumulate high-value pharmaceutical alkaloids and to block cannabinoid production in cannabis. The latter will allow for a safe, legal, made-in-Canada cannabis crop to be grown for fibre, oil and food use. The partnership with PPS is crucial since this corporation operates a highly secure, underground plant growth facility licensed for the cultivation of opium poppy and cannabis. The project will be conducted in collaboration with the NRC Plant Biotechnology Institute (PBI) and the Alberta Research Council (ARC), which have the required instrumentation and expertise.

"The unparalleled biosynthetic capacity of plants has long been exploited through the use of many species in traditional medicine and the application of pure metabolites as pharmaceuticals, flavours, fragrances, pigments, insecticides, and other fine chemicals. Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) are a large group of plant specialized metabolites derived from tyrosine and diversified by an intricate biochemical network of intramolecular coupling, reduction, methylation, hydroxylation, and other reactions that generate >2,500 known structures. Several BIAs (e.g. the analgesic morphine, the cough suppressant codeine, and the vasodilators papaverine and tubocurarine) serve directly as pharmaceuticals, or as precursors for semi-synthetic drugs (e.g. oxycodone). Plants remain the only economical source for these compounds due to their chemical complexity, which makes de novo synthesis challenging and costly. Most research on BIA metabolism has targeted biosynthetic enzymes and corresponding genes involved in the formation of relatively few compounds in only a limited number of species. An important feature of plant specialized metabolism is the ability of enzymes to acquire novel functions through random mutation. As such, a relatively limited number of enzyme types (i.e. SAM-dependent methyltransferases, acetylCoA-dependent acyltransferases, P450-dependent monooxygenases, FAD-dependent oxidoreductases, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases and aldo-keto reductases) are largely responsible for the establishment of the diverse backbone structures and functional group substitutions responsible for BIA structural diversity. A functional genomics strategy based on the integration and comparison of metabolite and transcript profiles from a collection of cultured plant species will be used to identify and characterize novel BIA biosynthetic enzymes. Genomics resources and molecular genetic tools will be used to identify and modulate transcription factors involved in the regulation of BIA metabolism. The cellular and subcellular localization of newly discovered BIA biosynthetic enzymes will be determined, and possible enzyme interactions will also be investigated.

"The utility of the biaryl structural motif has prompted intense research directed at the development of efficient and high yielding synthetic methods.  Transition metal catalysis has featured prominently in these efforts, leading to the establishment of a range of useful cross coupling reactions.  A common element in all of these processes is the need for two activated arenes that can react selectively with the metal catalyst.  While high yields can be achieved with pre-activated substrates, the need for dual pre-activation is inherently wasteful since these groups may require multiple steps for their installation.  Furthermore, not all regioisomers of the organometallic or aryl halide are readily available making some biaryl compounds difficult to access.  In some instances the pre-activated species may not be stable thus complicating application of this methodology.  This proposal targets the development of new metal catalyzed reactions for the preparation of biaryl molecules that require less, or no pre-activation steps.  Once successful, the new reactions should find significant application in the preparation of this important class of compound.

"We are requesting funds to study the process of separation of embryonic tissues. Newly formed tissues become delineated by so-called embryonic boundaries, which prevents cell mixing and are thus crucial to maintain the

organization of the embryo. Very little is known about the cellular mechanisms at work at the boundary. Understanding the mechanisms that maintain the coherence of a tissue and prevent cell mixing between different cell types is of general importance, including for human disease. Indeed, such processes appear to be de-regulated in cancer metastasis, where tumor cells can leave the tissue of origin and penetrate other tissues. We use the early frog embryo as a model, because it is easily accessible to experimentation and inexpensive. Most molecules are very similar between frogs and humans, and results obtained in our model can be readily used in other, medically relevant, model systems. In the previous granting period, we have been able to visualize directly cells while in the process of sorting, i.e. moving to the correct side of the boundary. We have discovered that that cells can still cross the boundary several hours after its formation, demonstrating that this structure is surprisingly permeable to cell migration, underscoring the importance of cells acquiring and maintaining the precise tissue identity, since no physical barrier would otherwise be able to prevent them to entering the wrong tissue. We have also observed that the strength of the adhesiveness of a cell toward its neighbors can be significantly inhibited without affecting significantly the proper sorting at the boundary, an unexpected finding that contradicts a widely accepted model for tissue formation based on the adhesive properties of cells. Instead, we propose that cells know which behavior they have to adopt (i.e. mixing with similar cells, but not with cells from a different tissue) thanks to surface sensors that detect the identity of neighboring cells. Our goal is to identify the molecules that mediate such cell to cell recognition by contact, and to unravel the mechanisms triggered by these signals that regulate the cell behavior.

"An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that can perform desired tasks in unstructured environments without continuous human guidance. In most cases, the application of groups of cooperative autonomous vehicles is crucial or accelerates the accomplishment of a desired task. For successful cooperative work, the autonomous vehicles must intelligently keep user-specified distances to each other, which is known as formation control.



Other researchers who consider multiple vehicles usually use simplified vehicle mathematical models or formation geometry, which lead to lower performance quality and limited flexibility in defining formations. Furthermore, obstacle avoidance, uncertainties in mathematical models, and environmental disturbances are rarely considered with the formation control. We propose a new formation control philosophy for marine and aerial vehicles that takes advantage of more accurate vehicle mathematical models, a 3-dimensional formation capability, improved autonomous obstacle avoidance, and cutting-edge control theories. The vehicles will be able to attain any 3-dimensional user-defined formation, compromise the formation to avoid obstacles and return to the formation after the obstacle is passed despite any external disturbances, e.g. waves or wind.



This research is aligned with the Canada's National Security Policy, which states that there can be no greater role for a nation than to protect its citizens from human-induced or natual disasters. The results of this research can provide the Canadian Forces with a drone fleet of ships or helicopters to aid military personnel, e.g in monitoring the Canadian Arctic Sovereignty, or in fighting unconventional wars. In addition, there are numerous civilian applications for autonomous vehicles, examples of which would include helicopter applications such as search and rescue in disaster scenes, mining support, geological survey, power line patrol, farm aerial spraying, timber survey, forest fire suppression, off-shore oil support, etc.

"We propose to develop and test policies and associated practices that farmers can use to enhance biodiversity while maintaining agricultural output. A variety of such policies and practices have been suggested but they have not been evaluated on the ground, and compared in terms of their effectiveness in sustaining biodiversity.  Hence our overall research question: Are there effective ways to indirectly measure the biodiversity of farmland (i.e., biodiversity indicators) and, if so, can we use these indicators to identify effective practices that farmers can use to enhance biodiversity on their farmlands? We hypothesize a strong link between biodiversity and landscape heterogeneity, i.e., the variety of landcover/landuse types and the complexity of their spatial distribution. We propose to measure biodiversity (birds, amphibians, bees, and butterflies) at a large number of agricultural sites throughout Eastern Ontario. We will use remotely-sensed data supplemented with farming

practice information to measure heterogeneity of the landscapes surrounding these sites at different spatial scales (within 1 to 10 km of the sites). We will then build statistical models relating biodiversity to the landscape heterogeneity measures. The heterogeneity measures or combination of measures with the strongest relationships to biodiversity will be used as the ""biodiversity indicators"". We will then build a landscape simulation model, from which we will determine the relationships between various possible agri-environmental policies/practices and the selected biodiversity indicators, to determine which agri-environmental policies are most effective in enhancing biodiversity. Our research collaborators and supporting organizations, Environment Canada, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Ontario Ministry of Agriculture Food and Rural

Affairs, ELUTIS Modelling and Consulting Inc., Food Alliance, Dairy Farmers of Canada, and Organic Agriculture Centre of Canada, will use the results in their mandates to inform farmers of best practices for environmental stewardship.",Agriculture,"Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Environment"
"Over the past 100 years roads have become a dominant landscape feature and this infrastructure continues to expand. Recently, ecological researchers and transportation planners have become increasingly concerned about the potential effects of roads and traffic on animal populations. Is this concern justified? How strong is the evidence that roads have a large impact on the distribution and abundance of animals? Although many studies have been conducted, almost all of them suffer from limitations in study design, which means it is not possible to estimate the effects of roads separately from the effects of other landscape changes such as deforestation, wetland loss, or agricultural intensification. My first objective is to rectify this situation; I will conduct empirical studies to determine the impact of roads and traffic on animal populations, independent of and in comparison to other landscape changes. Given that roads affect animal abundance, an important question for mitigation of these effects is, what kinds of species are most strongly affected by roads and how are they affected? For example, fencing and wildlife crossings can reduce road effects on species that are affected mainly through traffic mortality, while effects of traffic disturbance on animal abundance can likely only be mitigated by reducing traffic density in the landscape. I develop a set of hypotheses and predictions of how species characteristics - their movement ranges, reproductive rates, natural densities (territory/home range sizes), trophic interactions, and behavioural responses to roads, traffic emissions, and individual vehicles - determine the direction and size of the impact of roads on animal populations. My second objective is then to conduct a set of studies to test these predictions. The proposed research addresses three important applied questions: (i) to what extent should environmental and transportation agencies be concerned about the impacts of roads and traffic on wildlife? (ii) what kinds of species should be monitored for potential effects of roads? and (iii) what will be the most effective mitigation measures to minimize these effects?

"Constrained sequence coding is widely used in binary communication systems in order to improve the performance of these systems.  These coding techniques do so by ensuring that the encoded sequences have characteristics that, with high probability, will result in their accurate demodulation in the receiver.  These characteristics include time-domain constraints such as limits to the maximum and minimum runlengths of like-valued bits, and frequency-domain constraints such a spectral null at one or more predefined frequencies.  However, the advantages of constrained sequence codes have not yet been recognized by the designers of wireless systems in which the signaling constellations are larger than binary, nor by the designers of optical OFDM systems in which high peak-to-average power ratios result in signal degradation.



The major objectives of the research proposed in this grant application are:



(1) The development of specific constrained sequence codes for wireless and optical OFDM applications such that the channel constraints are matched, thereby resulting in improvement of the performance of both of these types of systems;



(2)  Demonstration to the wireless and optical OFDM communities that constrained sequence coding can and should be used in these applications in order to help overcome some of the technical hurdles that they now face.



The proposed research represents an extension of the applicant's prior work with coding for binary systems to constrained sequence coding for large signaling alphabets, and coding for optical OFDM systems.","Information, computer and communication technologies","Electrical and Computer Engineering"

"The proposed research program focuses on novel and practical adaptive signal processing and multiple access techniques for efficient wireless access to multimedia communications services. It applies to the ""next generation"" of wireless systems (beyond the currently emerging third generation systems). These techniques applied to next generation wireless systems will provide ubiquitous untethered access at data rates far higher than today's. 



The proposed research is part of a continuing research program whose main objective is to devise, improve and evaluate means to accommodate large and variable bit rate subscriber densities with realistic bandwidth, power and cost constraints. The envisioned traffic includes broadband multimedia services, voice over IP, and communications to and from myriad small sensor devices. It will be facilitated by adaptive space, time and frequency diversity processing at transmitters and receivers, and by techniques like intelligent relaying, cooperative diversity and cognitive intelligent radio spectrum sharing among user terminals.

"Cemented paste backfill (CPB), a mix of tailings, binder and water, is extensively used in the mining industry. Its main purpose is to ensure the stability of underground openings, safe and maximum ore recovery, and also to provide an environmental-friendly means of underground disposal of potential acid generating tailings. However, many fundamental aspects, such as the impact of temperature on the performance (mechanical stability, quality of the CPB) and durability (resistance to sulphate attack: sulphate attacks the binder and destroys its binding effect) properties are still poorly understood. Furthermore, it is well known that in a broad range of engineering problems the change of material properties and accumulation of damage are not only caused by mechanical loads, but also by temperature and moisture induced loading as well as chemically aggressive factors (e.g., sulphate) or various combinations of these processes. However, the level of knowledge on these interactions between thermal, chemical, hydric and mechanical processes in CPB is still very limited. Thus, an accurate prediction of the performance and durability properties of CPB needs a deep understanding of the effect of temperature on these properties and of the coupled thermo-chemo-hydric-mechanical (TCHM) mechanisms that occur in CPB, and the development of tools that will predict them. Hence, through the combination of experimental and modeling techniques, this research program will focus on the following objectives: (i) understand the impact of temperature and coupled TCHM loadings on the performance and durability properties of CPB; (ii) develop and validate advanced optimization tools that will make it possible to prepare optimal CPB recipes for any curing temperature; and (iii) develop and validate advanced TCHM models to predict the mechanical stability and the durability of CPB under various TCHM loading conditions. This proposed research will benefit the research community, mining industry, educational institutions, civil engineering firms, and Canadian community by providing of fundamental knowledge and advanced tools or techniques for sustainable and safe mining.

"My research interests are centered around `Positivity' in Linear Algebra and Graph Theory. Along these lines, I have proposed various research projects involving totally positive matrices and on properties of certain matrices associated to graphs.



The former is a well studied and fundamental class of matrices that arises in numerous applications, including statistics, mathematical biology, and computer aided geometric design. I intend to investigate a number of key problems associated with this class by making use of the combinatorial framework associated with certain matrix factorizations.



The main issue of interest to me concerning matrices associated with graphs comes from a classical problem known as an inverse eigenvalue problem (that is, the eigenvalues are provided and the corresponding matrix is desired). An important part of this inverse eigenvalue problem is the minimum rank problem. The connection between the two follows since rank and nullity are intimately related. The hope here is to appeal to the algebraic properties of matrices and combine them with the combinatorial characteristics of graphs to yield interesting results about this special collection of matrices.

"About 32% of Ontario's 15,000 bridges need rehabilitation or replacement. In Qu�bec, this percentage is 52%, with an estimated cost of $5B over the next 10 years. This project introduces a new technology that will change the way we build bridges and other infrastructure by enabling much faster and simpler construction and a longer design life. Readily available fiberglass sections and plates will be used as open forms for concrete casting in bridge decks, parking garages and marine platforms. They are then left in place permanently, providing reinforcement that fully or partially replaces internal steel bars. Corrosion of steel bars is a major contributor to the looming infrastructure crisis.  Because the forms are left in place and are noncorrosive, the project promises solutions for major problems such as traffic delays and road closures that hurt the economy, durability as in bridge decks exposed to deicing salts, and accessibility for removal of forms after concrete hardening. Structural models will be built using this technology and tested to failure in the lab, to evaluate their performance, strength and failure mode. Mathematical models will be developed, verified using test results and used in parametric studies to develop design guides for engineers. Indeed, results of the project promises substantial savings in tax dollars spent on infrastructure repair or replacement, allowing these funds to be used in other investments to improve quality of life for Canadians. The applicant has extensively studied concrete filled fiberglass tubes as closed forms for piles, columns or poles. He is now considered a leader and holds a Canada Research Chair in this area. He will also extend this work to include bridge column joints and highway signage. During the funding period, 2 PhD and 5 MSc students will be trained as future engineers capable of transferring technology from the lab to the field with confidence and enthusiasm. Training involves critical thinking, problem solving, hands-on experience, lab testing, data analysis, computer modeling, technical writing, presenting, team work and networking. Former grad. students of the applicant are hired by some of the top companies/agencies, including Delcan Corp and MTO (bridges) and Carl Walker Inc (parking structures)

"My proposed research is mainly in the direction of building flexible tree models and ensemble tree models for statistical learning in classification, regression and the statistical analysis of failure time data. The proposed research is expected to improve the information learning and prediction in physics, chemistry, drug discovery, biology, engineering and health sciences. 

[1] I propose building tree models and ensemble tree models using kernel-induced split rules. This proposal is novel and promising. [2] I propose building survival tree models for failure time data with a genetic algorithm stochastic search. The survival tree models generally use a Cox proportional hazards assumption. [3] I propose building a competing risks survival tree model for failure time data with more than one failure type. This is a novel research idea. We not only estimate the relative risk parameters of the subpopulations in the terminal nodes of the tree but also estimate them according to different failure types. [4] The kernel-type of split rules proposed in [1] can also be used in [2] and [3] to further enhance the performances of the proposed tree models for survival and competing risks analysis. This research proposal is novel. [5] I propose building survival tree models in [2] with the relative risk parameters in the terminal nodes estimated using information from all observations. The specific technique I propose is the soft-node survival tree. [6] For rare target prediction problems which are important in drug discovery and fraud detection, I propose using a ranking-type criterion which is called the average precision to build classification tree models instead of using the traditional Gini index or entropy measure. The proposal is novel and potentially superior to traditional models in this sense.



In summary, I propose flexible tree models and ensemble tree models to solve various practical and theoretical problems in classification, regression and failure time data analysis. Some of the above proposed projects are going to be assigned to graduate students I supervise or co-supervise in the future.

"In statistical modeling of data with dependent responses, measurement errors in covariates are often neglected, especially for data collected in socioeconomic studies. This causes estimation bias of the model parameters and usually leads to unsatisfactory efficiency of the inference.  The correction of this estimation bias has recently attracted the attention of statisticians.The generalized method of moments (GMM)  has been widely used to dependent data by economists to obtain consistent and efficient estimates of model parameters. It has be also demonstrated that the generalized quasilikelihood approach, which exploits the mean vector and the covariance structure of the repeated data, produces consistent and more efficient estimates compared with the GMM and other generalized estimating equations (GEE) methods. 

The preliminary simulation results based on GMM and GQL approaches that we have obtained from our investigation of bias correction in linear panel data models where possibly all the covariates are subject to measurement error are very promising. In this research program we will investigate bias correction of parameter estimation and their asymptotic properties based on the GMM and GQL approaches for different kinds of dependent data. We will also conduct Monte Carlo simulation to investigate their small sample properties.

The outcome of our proposed research will provide a more efficient and easy to manipulate method to handle dependent data with covariates subject to measurement errors. It can help practitioners to better understand their underlying research in different fields, such  as biomedical studies and socio-economic studies.

"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common type of primary brain tumor and its prognosis is very poor. The median survival of patients diagnosed with GBM is less than 12 months. Although its prevalence is low, GBM mainly affects age groups below 50, which makes it a devastating disease. Surgery is one of the most effective treatments for most patients. The extent of surgical resection is a primary determinant of outcome for this disease. Complete tumor resection is associated with longer survival and improved patient quality of life. Because of brain movement during the operation and the tumor margin is not visually from normal brain at the margin, complete tumor resection is very difficult without damage to eloquent areas

(language, motor, visual cortex) of the brain. We propose to develop a minimally-invasive, intra-operative method based optical spectroscopy technologies for the real-time identification of the tumor margin. The proposed optical technology will use fluorescence and reflection light from the tissue to distinguish between cancerous tissue and normal brain. This project will be carried out by a collaborative team consisting of biomedical engineers, medical physicists, and clinicians. In addition, two industrial partners will be participating in this project with their expertise in optical instrumentation and specialized optical fiber probe design and fabrication. The intended outcomes of this project include improvement of both the survival rate of brain tumor patients as well as their quality of life.

"Optical spectroscopy and imaging provides functional and structural information that reflects the biochemical and physiological characteristics of the biological system in questions. In practice, there are strong demands to further advance optical technologies into miniaturized in-situ applications. For example, in screening of cancers in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, it is highly desired to have wireless, encapsulated, functional, optical imaging modalities for minimally-invasive demarcation of malignant lesions from benign ones. Another example is implantable microfluidic and optical imaging based cellular analysis devices for continuously monitoring of the biochemical and physiological conditions of the patients. 

    Conventional optical spectroscopy and imaging systems are large, complex and costly, which limit their use in clinical applications. We propose a research program to develop miniature spectroscopic sensing and imaging systems based on Micro-optical-electro-mechanical-systems (MOEMS) and integrated optoelectronics technology. Conventional spectroscopic devices (gratings, mirrors, lens, and photo detectors) will be replaced by MOEMS enabled components, which would lead to significantly reduced size and cost. In this research program, we plan to to (i) develop Micro- optical spectroscopic and imaging devices for resolving and detecting optical signal from biological tissues; (ii) develop high sensitivity and high speed photo detection modules that can be integrated into the spectroscopic device; (iii) enable advanced, fully integrated platforms for biochemical assays and minimally-invasive medical diagnosis and surgery.  

    The proposed research will not only enable the miniaturization and integration of current macroscopic fluorescence sensing systems, but also allow its integration with other aforementioned technologies towards multi-modality clinical diagnostic imaging. The successful outcome of the proposed research program will lead to emerging new medical device technologies and training of highly qualified personals that will benefit the health care for Canadians and the vitality of the Canadian economy.","Biomedical engineering","Electrical and Computer Engineering"

"Groundwater seepage can lead to internal erosion of the finer grains of a soil skeleton. If it continues unchecked, the internal erosion will result in a significant loss of fines. This can affect the strength of the soil, leaving it weaker and, occasionally, susceptible to a localised collapse. The phenomenon occurs naturally in some hillslope soils. Earth dams, built from compacted hillslope soils, have also been found susceptible to internal erosion. The performance of large dams is routinely monitored, to ensure their safety. A proper understanding of the potential for internal erosion, in soils that are deemed susceptible, complements the monitoring and operation of earth dams, over their long service life. It assists engineers in interpreting the performance data with complete confidence, and allocate maintenance budgets accordingly. The proposed research examines the fundamentals of internal erosion, and the linkage to loss of soil strength.



Rainfall on steep hillslope soils can result in rapidly moving landslides, termed debris flows. The path of the debris flow can impact infrastructure such as roads, railways and pipelines and, on occasion, leads tragically to loss of life. A prediction of debris flow travel distance is crucial to the assessment of landslide risk, and the recommendation of effective protective measures. The proposed research compares an empirical model for travel distance against the characteristics of some problematic debris flow sites in British Columbia and overseas.

"There has been increasing demand for Knowledge Management (KM) solutions for intellectual assets in companies and governmental organizations. Conventional KM solutions are mainly based on centralized architectures comprised of central databases or Web repositories accessible using browsers and semi-formal queries. Experience shows that such architectures cannot be used effectively in heterogeneous computing environments. Modern KM solutions concentrate on three key research areas: representation, distribution and management of knowledge resources. On the distribution and management side, run-time ontology resolution has recently received much attention.  

The objectives of the proposed research are: (1) to devise methods for run-time ontology resolution based on concept learning from multiple peers with individualized ontologies; (2) to devise methods for semantic search using thus mentioned concept learning; and (3) to build a semantic search engine (SSE) that can be used in a KM solution. 

The SSE consists of a systematically developed set of modules that can be combined to conduct simultaneous search and ontology learning at various level of abstraction.  The main purpose of the SSE is to produce effective returns with regards to defined queries based upon the collected pieces of information with semantic diversity that are distributed physically in multiple repositories.  This is possible even if partially overlapping sets of features are used to represent a concept in different repositories. The results of the searches will be aggregated into learned patterns that will efficiently serve future queries. Such a system has several potential applications in information retrieval, medical diagnosis and battlefield planning. Since the proposed research aims to deliver a proof-of-concept, it will focus on supporting theory building linked to a restricted class of techniques and tools, by focusing on KM for software engineering project repositories.

"Pesticide fate models can be used to predict the fate of pesticides and estrogens in soil. When used at the large scale, one of the main sources of uncertainty surrounding the application of pesticide fate models is insufficient knowledge of the spatial variability of pesticide/estrogen sorption and degradation input parameters. Therefore, the proposed research will examine the spatial variability of pesticide/estrogen sorption and degradation in two hummocky terrains and, based on this knowledge, utilize digital terrain models to develop an improved approach to stochastic pesticide fate modelling at the large scale. The Prairie Pothole Region (770,000 km2) has millions of wetlands associated with agricultural land. For example, the two hummocky terrains central to this research each have about 200 wetlands on site. Water levels in prairie wetlands are sensitive to climate variability, but this information has not been integrated into estimates of pesticide concentrations in wetland water. Therefore, through the use of digital elevation models derived for four prairie wetlands, the proposed research will refine existing hydrological models to provide the means of modelling the impact of climate variability on concentrations of pesticides in prairie wetlands. 



There are at least three reasons why this research is important: (1) This will be the first study to determine, in detail, the fate of emerging contaminants (estrogens) in soil profiles at the soil-landscape level; (2) The research will lead to significant improvements in regulatory and environmental risk assessments at the large scale, and (3) The new wetland water model will improve our knowledge of the impact of climate variability on prairie wetland water quality.

"Operator theory and the theory of operator algebras arose in the twentieth century, in part, out of a need to provide the mathematical tools for the newly emerging field of quantum physics. While there remain important connections between this branch of mathematics and physics, the quantisation of physics has carried over to mathematics, where certain mathematical structures are revealed (or classified) only by taking into account their features as ""noncommutative"" entities. This view is especially prevalent in modern analysis and algebra, and in operator algebra theory in particular.  The goal of my research program is to advance operator algebra theory through the study of order, convexity, and topology, and to apply operator-algebraic methods to problems in single operator theory.



It is very common to study a C*-algebra A or an operator system E by way of one of its enveloping structures. My research program has been investigating such structures that arise from the so-called Hamana theory of injective envelopes. Essentially the Hamana theory embeds a C*-algebra A or an operator system E into an injective C*-algebra which is, in a sense that can be made precise, the smallest injective C*-algebra that contains A or E. The process of passing from A to its injective envelope I(A) is very much like the passage from the rational numbers to the real numbers. Of course the noncommutativity of C*-algebras adds a level of complexity that is not seen with ordinary number systems. The enveloping structures I am considering are local multiplier algebras, regular monotone completions, C*-envelopes, and injective envelopes. Each of these structures make useful appearances in operator algebra theory and operator theory in different ways. However, none of these algebras are well understood. My research consists of a number of avenues of investigation that will, I believe, reveal some of the fundamental properties of these enveloping algebras.","Mathematical sciences","Pure & Applied Maths - A"

"Wear of materials is a significant industrial problem; a recent National Research Council of Canada report estimated that the cost of wear to Canadian Industry is approximately 10 billion dollars annually. This stresses the need to develop economically and technologically viable materials research programs in friction and wear of materials. The importance of this research field has become obvious to engineers in the U.S.A., Japan and Europe as many large research and development initiatives are now active. Unfortunately, the occurrence of similar programs in Canada is disproportionately low. The applicant proposes to conduct research in a number of key areas that are pivotal to enhancing our understanding of wear and friction of advanced materials and processes. The proposed research program will be of significant value to the automotive, aerospace and manufacturing industries. One pertains to the problem of low workability of wear resistance bulk superelastic TiNi. To achieve better workability the applicant proposes to synthesize a new generation of wear resistant micro-laminated superelastic Ti/TiNi/Ni composites. This is expected to have improved workability over bulk TiNi due to the presence of pure Ni and Ti layers. In another branch, the origin of friction will be studied using atomic force microscopy. The interactions of solids in contact during relative motion, at the microscale are of great importance to the understanding of friction phenomena. The contribution of surface roughness to the measured friction force at ultra-low loads and the effect of asperity height and slope on friction will be examined in details. Finally, wear monitoring of cubic boron nitride in precision finish hard turning (PFHT) will be pursued. Tool wear is one of the major factors contributing to geometrical error in machined components. In this area, the applicant intends to determine the relationships between tool wear, cutting forces, tool geometry and machining conditions in order to optimize PFHT operation for workpiece high quality surface finish and accuracy. Ultimately, it is hopped that a real-time monitoring strategy, based on the empirical data collected, will be developed to predict tool life. Such a strategy is expected to lead to major cost savings.","Materials performance","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng."

"My research is on algebraic structures called ""rings"". I use graphs and other such geometric structures to find algebraic properties of rings, and conversely I am interested in how the algebra of rings can affect the geometry of the objects I use. One technique that I apply often is to associate to a certain ring a graph, that is, a set of points some of which are connected by lines, or a hypergraph, which is a higher-dimensional counterpart of a graph. Using this technique I have been able to partially classify hypergraphs that correspond to rings with desirable properties from an algebraic point of view. My goal is to conduct deeper investigations in this direction and to find stronger classification techniques. The importance of this project is that many algebraic properties that are difficult to verify for a ring may be easier to verify once they are translated into properties of hypergraphs.

"Neutrinos are one of the most abundant particles in the universe, yet their critical properties, like their absolute mass, are unknown. Recent results from experiments like SNO, SuperKamiokande and Kamland have demonstrated that neutrinos have mass, but only the mass differences could be measured. Neutrinoless double beta decay offers a unique possibility to investigate  for the mass amplitude and type. This process implies the simultaneous beta decays of two nucleons within a single atomic nucleus, with neutrinos interacting in a way that they do not leave the nucleus. This is only possible if neutrinos possess mass and special properties. The discovery of neutrinoless double beta decay would imply that neutrinos are their own anti-particles. This decay, if it exists, will be extremely rare and the very low background techniques developed by SNO will be essential to bring this search to success. The hardware requested in this proposal will be utilized to mitigate background in the EXO-200 detector which searches for neutrino-less double beta decay of xenon-136 nuclei and to calibrate the detector response to gamma rays, the principal source of background.

"The development of the germ cell (oocyte or spermatozoa) is critical for reproductive function. The processes involved in the development and maturation of germ cells are not well understood. We have identified a gene that is expressed in the germ cells of divergent species, from flies to man. The function of this gene is not known but we believe it modulates the production or function of other gene products. In order to determine the role of this gene, termed Clast4, we have focused our attention on its function in the mouse oocyte. We will first determine what will be the effect of removal or blocking the appearance of the gene or its protein product. We will use either antibodies against the protein or a technique, termed RNA inhibition, to block the gene expression. Another approach utilizes modification of one part of the protein which we suspect is important for its function. We will apply these approaches to either isolated mouse oocytes or by genetically manipulating mice so that they do not express the gene in their oocytes. Once we have identified the function of this gene in oocytes, we will examine how it achieves this function. We have found that the protein generated by this gene is altered at a critical stage in oocyte development, just before it can be fertilized. We suspect that the alteration, which involves adding a phosphate complex to the protein, is responsible. We will first determine where the phosphate complex is added on the protein and then prevent the addition. Finally, to gain further insight into the function of Clast4, we will determine how it modulates the appearance of other proteins and identify which particular proteins are modulated. The results of these studies will disclose the role of Clast4 in female reproduction through its effect on the oocyte. A better understanding of this role will permit us to examine if it functions in other systems such as the male reproductive system as well as in the nervous system where this type of regulation is also important.","Animal production and animal primary products","Integrative Animal Biology"
"The goal of geophysics is to understand, and perhaps predict, the dynamic processes that move and shape the Earth beneath our feet, and to ""look"" into the Earth to see these processes in action, or their consequences. One technique for remotely sensing what the structure of the subsurface is, even to depths of tens of kilometres, uses electromagnetic fields. In this technique, electric currents are induced to flow in the rocks. The strength and disposition of the currents depend on rock type. Metallic ores, for example, are relatively good at conducting electricity. The induced currents in the ground give rise, in turn, to electromagnetic fields which can be measured. The strengths and variations of these measurements depend on the induced currents, and so on the rocks themselves. It is therefore possible to turn the measurements on their heads, that is, invert them, and extract information about what the rock types are in the subsurface. The proposed research determines to (i) improve the mathematics used by computer programs to predict what the induced currents would be if the rock types in the subsurface were known, and (ii) improve the programs that invert measurements of the electromagnetic fields to generate models of the structure of the Earth. Recent advances have produced what is effectively the first generation of these programs for fully three-dimensional models of the Earth. However, the mathematical representations these programs use for the arrangements of rock types in the subsurface are basic, being neither flexible enough to cope with the complicated structures that occur in nature, nor precise enough to handle the dramatic changes between adjacent rock types that can exist for certain important features such as ore deposits. This research programme will investigate the use of more sophisticated and refined representations of the subsurface to overcome these problems. The result will be computer programs that can provide more detailed and more reliable models, or ""images"", of the subsurface. These programs will be of use to the mining industry, enabling new ore deposits to be found. They will also be of use in remotely sensing groundwater resources, geotechnical applications, and in determining the deep structure of the Earth's crust.","Mineral resources ( prospecting, exploration, mining, extraction, processing)","Solid Earth Sciences"
"The current aim of this proposal is to develop X-Ray analysis instrumentation for a number of applications.  The main component of the work will be the design and testing of an instrument that will provide quantitative estimates on human tissue parameters that can be used to characterise a tissue sample and use this information to aid the work of both histopathologists and surgeons.  Histopathology is the link between diagnosis and patient management and involves the use of a small tissue sample which is analysed in order to recognise the disease type and extent.  The outcome of this procedure may lead to the patient undergoing surgery to remove the tissue from which the small sample was taken. One of the problems in surgery is the ability to detect the margins of the tumour being excised i.e. the border between diseased and healthy tissue. Our device will enable surgeons to test if these margins have been reached and hence improve the outcome of the operation. Our work to date has been undertaken using breast and liver tissue but will also be applicable to cervix, prostate, bladder, colon and kidney.  The tissue samples will be analysed by recording data produced from the interactions of x-rays with the tissue in the form of x-ray scattering, x-ray fluorescence from trace and minor elements within the tissue as well as transmission measurements.  The data will be combined in a novel analytical procedure based upon a multivariate statistical approach.  We propose to obtain the characteristic features of these x-ray signals, develop the experimental methods to obtain them simultaneously, quickly and reliably, and to develop predictive models that will allow classification of an unknown sample. The final outcome of the proposal will be the design of a compact instrument suitable for use in the hospital environment that has the potential to improve postoperative outcomes for patients and reduce healthcare costs.

"Modern technology allows oxygen concentrations in fluids to be measured with a fibreoptic system (optodes).  These optodes can be easily inserted into blood vessels and report the oxygen concentration contained in blood.  My research program is pioneering such measurements in swimming salmon. The challenge has been to develop an optode that has the correct shape to be implanted in a fish vein and still be sufficiently robust that it does not easily break when the fish struggles.  Working with Ocean Optics we have developed a prototype that will work.  This technology, once purchased, can then be used to test a very important hypothesis concerning why fishes die at high water temperature.  The hypothesis is that, at high temperature, the fish heart is unable to deliver sufficient oxygen to other tissues to meet their oxygen demands, which then triggers a cardiovascular collapse.  Purchase of this equipment is urgently needed to complete the experiments that are testing this hypothesis, progress that would keep my research laboratory at the leading edge of its field.","Advancement of knowledge","Biological Systems and Functions"

"This research program builds upon prior experimental and numerical work funded by NSERC to investigate the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a natural refrigerant in automotive air-conditioning systems in particular, with a further general application to residential and commercial systems. Ozone depletion potential and global warming potential are the two established indicators for the direct environmental impact of the release of refrigerants. The hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants, which were once expected to be acceptable permanent replacement fluids, are now on the list of regulated substances due to their impact on climate change. The current application of high global warming potential refrigerants such as R-134a has led to the revival of CO2 as a naturally occurring refrigerant.

Recent research has observed that CO2 performs as good as other conventional refrigerants and even better in low-temperature applications. The performance of the basic transcritical CO2 system, however, is not yet competitive in high-temperature applications due both to its high compression temperature as well as the thermodynamic losses associated with throttling. The focus of this research program is to develop high performance, environmentally friendly, advanced transcritical CO2 refrigeration systems with various cycle modifications, including: staging of the compression and expansion, the use of microchannel heat exchangers, work generating expansion instead of throttling, and the coupling of the compressor to a stand alone vertical axis wind turbine for independent power usage by the CO2 system. The proposed advanced work will be built on an existing well-instrumented transcritical CO2 refrigeration system, which is recently developed, commissioned, and successfully test operated at University of Windsor. The intent of this research program is to investigate, characterize, and improve both the equipment-related factors that affect the system performance, as well as the characterization of refrigerant-related factors that affect the global environment. The Canadian HVAC, environmental, energy, and transportation industries will benefit greatly from these research outcomes.

"Fundamental problems in computer science revolve around the discovery of efficient algorithms. In the past 5-6 years, computer scientists have witnessed an explosive growth of interest in algorithmic game theory which deals with models where there are no trusted coordinator and the outcome depends on the cooperation or competition by parties of different interests. One aspect of my research will focus on network routing and its generalizations as a non-cooperative game - a line of research in algorithmic game theory. As an example, this work includes a precise analysis of the extension of the classical selfish routing model to the model in which we incorporate the concept of ""time"" (when all users of a link do not experience the same latency). 

     At the same time, the widespread use of search engines on the Web and its ramifications have raised a variety of important algorithmic issues. In a second aspect of my research, I will consider those issues that concern the sponsored search advertisements. Finding optimum bidding strategies for advertisers, studying the convergence of such strategies (as both the search engine and the advertiser seek for a stable market) and bringing the concept of ""externality"" (when advertisers care who are the other advertisers on the page) to the existing models are parts of this work. The goods that are being sold in search ads auctions (the search queries) have two interesting characteristics: (i) they should be allocated to the buyers in a fraction of a second or they will perish instantly; and (ii) their total supply is unknown. I will examine the on-line nature of these auctions and in particular, focus on finding optimum ""reserve prices"" for keywords. 

     Designing fast algorithms or proving that no fast algorithm exists intimately relies, in many cases, on geometrical and graph theoretic characteristics of the problem. I also intend to work on some of the important problems in graph colouring - a traditionally important area of graph theory for computer scientists. Structure of colour-critical graphs, improper colourings and list-colouring of certain classes of planar graphs will be examined.

"The funds requested in this proposal will serve to provide resources required to carry out the PI's new research program on ""Testing and verification of Concurrent Software"". The PI has been working in as a research the area of verification of concurrent systems for the past 5 years, and is planning to launch her own research group as a new faculty.



With the establishment of multicore processors, and the introduction of language-level thread primitives in languages like Java and C#, and the advent of distributed web services, concurrency has become commonplace in application software. The design of concurrent programs is notoriously error-prone due to the nondeterministic interaction among concurrently executing threads. This makes testing of concurrent software extremely hard. 



The goal of this research is to develop effective automatic techniques to verify and test concurrent software. Specifically, the PI plans to address the following three problems: 



- Checking  for atomicity violations in concurrent programs, and

- compositionally verifying software modules using learning, and 

- Developing techniques for concurrent program analysis.



The proposed research will result in new techniques and tools for concurrent software verification that will have immediate impact on analysis tools built and used in the software industry.

"Dans plusieurs r�gions des provinces canadiennes, les conditions hivernales sont s�v�res et persistent souvent pendant de longues p�riodes, ce qui favorise l'accumulation de la glace et de la neige sur des ouvrages �lectriques externes, y compris les isolateurs.

"Production of poultry meat in Canada begins at turkey and chicken breeder farms where fertile eggs are produced by the ""parents"" of birds that are grown and processed for meat.  After a bird egg is laid, development of the embryo inside the egg is temperature dependent.  Eggs produced by domestic poultry are shipped to commercial hatcheries and placed inside large incubators that provide optimum temperature (about 37.5 celcius) conditions.  The chicks and poults (turkey hatchlings) that hatch from these eggs are grown out and eventually processed for meat for consumers.  Therefore, understanding the basic biology of the factors that affect embryonic growth and survival is key to the economic success of the Canadian poultry industry.  Studying the growth of poultry embryos is fascinating.  At the time the egg is laid, the embryo is smaller in diameter than an eraser on the end of a pencil (3-4 mm), but is made up of thousands of cells.  Interestingly, this egg, with the future hatchling inside, does not have to be incubated immediately.  The egg can be stored at cool temperatures for up to seven days without significantly harming the chances of the embryo to grow and hatch once proper incubation temperatures are provided.  Because commercial hatcheries are a great distances away from the egg producing farms, eggs are usually stored at the farm then trucked about every three days in order to reduce transportation costs.  Scientists studying poultry embryo growth have assumed that as long as the egg is stored below about 20 degrees celcius that the embryo (and the cells that make up the embryo) does not grow.  However, this assumption regarding poultry embryonic growth has not been scientifically confirmed.  Because embryos of eggs that are stored longer than seven days have a significantly reduced chance of growing normally and producing a healthy hatchling, it is suspected that some embryo growth or metabolism in the cells is occurring. Although it is the most fundamental question regarding poultry embryonic growth, to date it is still unknown what is the minimum temperature for poultry embryonic growth to occur (physiological zero). The research outlined in this proposal will answer this question.

"This proposal addresses the use of optical coding technology in three different fibre optic network applications. The first concerns optical encryption of data for communications security, the second focuses on the network management issues in emerging access passive optical networks and the last considers employing optical codes in fibre-optic sensing networks. 

For optical communications security, coding is used as an information encryption technique. We propose to exploit two-dimensional coding and advanced superstructure Bragg gratings to protect mission critical data from jamming and eavesdropping. Besides multi path immunity, spread-spectrum could be used to provide network protection and fast service restoration for special mission critical network links.

For passive network management applications, the code carries the management and network status information instead of data. We propose the use of modified optical code division multiplexing techniques to manage standard passive optical networks including EPON and GPON and more advanced architectures like wavelength division multiplexed WDM/PONs. Our technique promises to be scalable for even more complex access and metropolitan networks including various architectures.

For optical sensing network applications, the encoder, i.e. superstructure Bragg grating, serves as a sensor (or transducer). Interaction between the light and the measurand (stress, temperature, pressure, etc.) will affect the code and the correlation function instead of the wavelength (as is the case of Bragg gratings based sensors). Our technique promises to dramatically expand the capacity of sensing networks.

"Motion processing is one of the most fundamental perceptual functions as it is essential to avoid potentially dangerous events and is used by humans to allow interaction with the environment. The research program proposed here is a continuation of our previous work on basic aspects of motion processing using a full-immersive virtual environment (FIVE).  The program proposes among other things to study the effects of optic-flow on postural control.  Optic-flow is the type of motion that is perceived from elements in the visual scene while moving in the environment and is considered to be ecological.  Mechanisms responsible for perceiving optic flow will be studied as a function of normal development and visual field characteristics.  Furthermore, the capacity for tracking multiple moving elements in a large three-dimensional volumetric space will also be assessed within the immersive virtual reality environment.  The research derived from this program will help us better understand how we perceive, integrate and how we can use dynamic visual information in large field three-dimensional conditions similar to some naturalistic contexts.",Psychology,"Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences"
"The aging demographics clearly indicate that the mean age of the North American population is increasing

rapidly. Presbyopia is a well-known consequence of the aging human eye. Almost 100% of the population

will be faced with this problem in the 50s and the majority of humans will show signs of presbyopia in the 40s.

Because near vision is increasingly important in the work environment and for leisure, an adequate correction

strategy for this problem becomes a primordial issue for the aging population. The number of people that

require new presbyopic corrections each year in Canada is huge and increasing each year. This market will

certainly create many new job opportunities and will require specialized highly qualified personnel. Over the

past five years in the NSERC-Essilor Industrial Research Chair on Visual Perception and Presbyopia, we have

demonstrated innovative strategies and elucidated interesting scientific questions that were driven by applied

needs. The consequence is that Essilor, based on research findings, has successfully implemented a series of

designs related to specific and measurable human behaviors. Other work from the research Chair has lead to

patent applications and will be available in the form of licenses. The Chair has also developed very specialized

and unique expertise in regards to the simulation of ophthalmic distortions in a full-immersive virtual

environment and we have become a unique training site for this type of manipulation. The continued work of

the research chair will build on techniques and expertise that we have developed with immersion virtual reality

techniques. It will have three main orientations: 1) Simulation of distortions and their consequence on human

performance, 2) Specific eye-head strategies used by observers in ecological environments, 3) Visual and

visual-motor performance chances as a function of additional sensory inputs (multisensory integration).",Psychology,University/Industry

"Two of the most important application areas in the biomaterial literature have been the development of scaffolds and delivery systems for tissue engineering and drug delivery respectively. In both cases the development of interconnected porous structures of controlled porosity and microstructure as well as control over surface functionalization are important concerns. Polymer-polymer blending of biopolymers offers the possibility to develop an entirely new platform of materials without having to synthesize or develop entirely new polymers. In this project we will concentrate on morphology and interface control in multiphase biopolymer systems as a route towards the development of novel porous biomaterials. We propose an approach based on a combination of co-continuous morphology control in polymer blends and layer by layer (LbL) deposition phenomena which will be used to prepare fully interconnected porous biopolymer structures of 60-90% void volume with controlled pore size. LbL deposition will also be used to control the surface functionality in order to enhance biocompatibility, cell adhesion, and drug release rates depending on the particular application. Sub-micron porous structures will be prepared for the drug delivery application and porous structures in the 50-200 micron range will be prepared for the tissue growth scaffold application. Ideally a polymeric scaffold needs to address multiple functions such as nutrient transport as well as tissue growth. In this regard we will also study the possibility of preparing multiple-percolated systems based on encapsulated co-continuous blends as a route towards preparing materials of multiple network porosity. The properties and performance of these materials will be examined in detail. This project will aim to develop novel biomaterials as well as advance knowledge in a number of areas of current intense research activity.

Video compression techniques are thus used to reduce the uncompressed raw video streams (~25 Mbps) to compressed streams (~4Mbps for MPEG-2 and less than 2Mbps for MPEG-4 codecs suite) to enable the multiplexing of several streams over current telecommunication infrastructure. Intuitively, this endeavour requires a strong synergy between the two research communities: the video compression and coding community and the networking community. This research aims to increase the dialogue between the two by building on the current literature and proposing (i) new video trace formats and (ii) new rate-control protocols for mass-delivery of video IP packets. The key challenge posed by the transmission of video traffic over IP networks is its high bit-rate variability and sensitivity to jitter. Unlike voice and data VBR models, characterizing the statistical behaviour of video traffic has been mostly based so far on empirical analysis and/or mathematical modeling that assume no packet losses in the transport network. The difficulty lies in the fact that video bit-rate variation depends on both (1) media content (e.g., amount of motion) and (2) compression technique used. Complications also stem from the lack of adequate mapping between transport network Quality of Service (QoS) parameters (packet-losses or bandwidth constraints) and decoded video quality as perceived by the end-user termed ""Quality of Experience"" (QoE).

  The first part involves studying statistical behaviour of MPEG-4/H.264/AVC generated video streams in terms of marginal distribution and autocorrelation to derive mathematical models that capture the codecs' statistics. The second step is to experiment with network protocols that will tie application-level (QoE) to network-level metrics (QoS). Rate-control (RC) protocols can exploit this additional information to provide differentiated treatment to video flows based on network conditions.

"Sandstone uranium deposits represent a major strategic source of uranium in the world. However, there is no current sandstone-hosted uranium production in Canada, despite the fact that favorable geological environments are present in the Prairie and Maritime provinces.  Therefore, one of the key objectives of our proposed study is to reactivate research on sandstone-hosted uranium deposits by studying two US examples and using this information to more effectively guide exploration for this type of deposit in Canada and elsewhere in the world.



The goal of the proposed research is to provide an understanding of the critical processes required to form the Three Crow roll-front deposit in the Crawford Basin, which is in close proximity to Cameco's Crow Butte deposit, Nebrask, and two tabular type deposits from the Uravan district, Colorado Plateau.  Comparing the detailed characteristics of these deposits is crucial to our understanding of fluid migration and the migration of uranium and other radionuclides in the subsurface.  The geochemical signatures typical of these deposits can provide valuable exploration tools and insight regarding processes that transport, concentrate and modify radioactive minerals in near-surface environments, and improve our understanding of the evolution of tabular and roll type uranium deposits.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"
"Approximately 30% of the world's U reserve is derived from the Athabasca Basin unconformity-type uranium deposits, Canada.  These deposits are geologically significant because they are an important energy resource (over 460 million kilograms of U) and they have been used as natural analogues for the geologic disposal of radioactive waste.  The unconformity-type uranium deposits from the Athabasca Basin can be subdivided into sandstone-hosted and basement-hosted deposits.  Although both subtypes have been studied extensively, understanding the key processes involved in the genesis and subsequent alteration of these deposits has been challenging.  



The goal of the proposed research is to use the state-of-the-art VESPERS beamline at the Canadian Light Source to study the chemistry and crystal structure of pre-, syn-, and post ore alteration minerals from the basement hosted McArthur R. Uranium deposit.  The use of this relatively new technique can potentially provide an unprecedented understanding of the critical processes required to form the unconformity-type uranium deposits. The data will be used to ultimately develop a geological and geochemical model of the McArthur R. uranium deposit.  Data interpretation and presentation include statistical analyses that incorporate both spatial and temporal relations of the mineralogical and geochemical data and identification of key processes that resulted in ore formation.  These data will allow us to compare the McArthur R. deposit to other well studied unconformity-type uranium deposits (e.g., Cigar Lake) from the Athabasca Basin.  This work will significantly contribute to our knowledge of unconformity-type uranium deposits and the sedimentary basins that host these deposits, and in particular the processes that transport, concentrate, and modify radioactive minerals in near-surface environments.

"Fluid-rock interactions are largely responsible for the formation of important exploitable energy-related geological resources, including fossil fuels, geothermal, fissionable materials and metals.  A quantitative and predictive understanding of these resources requires knowledge of the age of formation and subsequent fluid history of the system over geological time. Isotope geochemistry is a powerful tool for investigating fluid-rock interaction.  Although the effects of fluid-rock interactions can be monitored over 1000s of cubic kilometers (e.g., sedimentary basins), fluid-rock interaction and the resultant isotopic variations are controlled by various nano- and microscale processes, including (1) recrystallization, (2) replacement, (3) solution/precipitation, (4) surface and grain boundary diffusion, and (5) volume diffusion.  Isotope exchange rates, and hence temporal dependency, vary with dominant transport mechanism.  Isotopic (and chemical) heterogeneities are a potentially powerful source of information on the conditions and temporal history of fluid-rock interaction, providing crucial evidence of processes and rates that impact mass transfer up to the global scale.  I propose to quantify fluid-uraninite interactions through the use of stable and radiogenic isotopes, focusing on the nano-and micro-scale mechanisms controlling isotopic exchange through studies of both natural and experimental systems.  I plan to complement high-precision microscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (SIMS) isotope analyses with higher spatial-resolution imaging techniques (e.g., HRTEM) that will allow us to link specific isotopic signals with mechanistic signatures and textures.  An important application of this research is the evaluation of fluid-solid interaction on the disposal of high-level radioactive waste in geological repositories.  Understanding how radionuclides migrate in a variety of geological environments, in time, can wield significant influence on Canadian government and public policy regarding the disposal of radioactive waste.

"For a building to provide the desired indoor environment at minimum cost in terms of energy and durability, the flow of heat, air, and moisture (HAM) across the building envelope must be understood, measured and controlled. The objectives of this research aim to increase the knowledge base and graduate professionals in the building envelope through the projects listed below:

1. The test method, initiated by the applicant to quantify for the first time ""climatic load"" and response relationships of wall systems subjected to water intrusion in the stud cavity, will be used and extended (i) to develop a common yardstick or standard whereby the relative performance of different building envelope configurations can be compared and improved and (ii) to move building envelope design further towards the engineering approach to enhance performance.

2. The data sets generated from the SRO (special research opportunity) will be used and extended to gain a better understanding of the interaction of the outdoor environment, the building envelope, and the indoor environment. 

3. Development of tools will be continued using Information Technology (IT) to carry out comprehensive evaluations of building envelope and building systems. Such tools will be particularly useful to manufacturers of industrialized housing to establish and improve the performance of their products for world export.

4. Collaboration with Dr. Hua Ge will be continued to consolidate a Building Engineering base in Vancouver.



The experimental results along with the results that will have been obtained from the above projects will be generalized by applying principles of existing analytical methods such as limit state design. The data will also be used to validate computer models in collaboration with colleagues who have developed such models in the past.

"Non-invasive technologies for the diagnosis of disease are playing an increasingly important role in the medical field.  In the past several years, early detection of breast cancer based on the electromagnetic properties of breast tissues has become of increasing interest. The properties of normal tissues and cancers are expected to differ; differences in the properties of malignant and benign tissues may be used to differentiate cancers from non-cancerous lesions.  One approach to breast cancer detection using electromagnetic properties, Tissue Sensing Adaptive Radar (TSAR), is under development at the University of Calgary.  This microwave technology is based on an ultra-wideband (UWB) radar system.  Essentially, short pulses of microwaves are transmitted into the breast and reflections are collected.  Increased reflections are expected from tumours, due to the differences in electromagnetic properties of tumours and healthy tissues. After reduction of unwanted signals, the reflections are focused in order to locate tumours in three dimensions.  The TSAR approach is patient-friendly, as it does not involve breast compression or ionizing radiation.



To date, our work indicates that TSAR is a promising technology.  Studies with both simulated and experimental data have been performed.  A laboratory prototype system has been developed for experimental work, consisting of a simple breast model or phantom, a system for scanning the model and an antenna to send and receive pulses.  Results demonstrate successful detection and localization of tumour models.  The next step in TSAR research is development of a clinical prototype, and this research project aims to implement a TSAR system suitable for scanning volunteers.  This prototype includes development of an ergonomic patient interface and improved TSAR imaging algorithms.  In addition, we propose to explore the application of the TSAR technology to areas such as diagnosis of other diseases and non-invasive sensing.

"Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize the world of information science and technology; the main issue facing scientists is how to build them.  My research will explore how the coldest gases ever created might be used to operate prototype quantum information devices.



Unlike the computers that we use every day, whose operation relies on classical mechanics and electromagnetism, quantum computers would be fundamentally based on the rules of quantum mechanics. The main components would be objects such as individual atoms, quantum dots (nanoscale `artificial atoms'), or small superconducting regions. Not only would such a quantum computer allow tremendous miniaturization of the various components, it has potential to solve certain classes of problems, such as factorization, database searching, and optimization, much more efficiently than its classical counterpart.



My research centres on implementations of quantum logic based on ultracold alkali atoms like sodium or rubidium. At extremely low temperatures (only a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero), alkali atoms become `quantum degenerate' and begin to display their quantum mechanical nature. By manipulating them with external lasers, magnetic fields, and microwave pulses, it is possible to coax them into the kinds of quantum mechanical states that are needed in order to build rudimentary quantum computers. Often, these states are expected to have properties that are much like utterly different systems, such as the high-temperature superconductors and semiconductors in high magnetic fields. The primary question that I will address in this research is how to perform robust quantum computation with ultracold atomic gases, without incurring so many errors that the final results become meaningless. This work will be carried out in close collaboration with on-going experiments.

"My research focuses on the mechanical properties of soft biological tissues, and the investigation of their response to external stimuli, growth, adaptation, failure, degeneration. I am particularly interested in the development of theoretical models of soft tissues, in order to predict their mechanical and physical properties, based on tissue microstructure. The theoretical approach is based on descriptions of a certain system by means of a set of equations. In several cases, these equations can be used analytically to find important basic relationships between physical quantities. However, there are cases in which the equations are so complex that it is impossible to derive any result directly. Furthermore, theoretical models cannot be directly used to solve specific problems characterised by complex geometry and/or boundary conditions (for example, the mechanics of a biological joint, with bones, articular cartilage, ligaments, etc).

For these complex cases, it is necessary to implement the equations describing the system into a numerical model, and this is the main goal of this proposal. The primary specific aims of this research are A) modelling the interaction between the solid matrix and the interstitial fluid, while simultaneously considering the role of electrical charges in soft tissues such as cartilage; B) determining the effects of collagen fibres on large-strain elasticity of soft tissues, such as articular cartilage, in which the fibres have a complex arrangement; and C) studying the effect of the porosity of the tissue on its overall elastic properties.

The computational and theoretical programme will be developed simultaneously. I proved for which cases the analytical models I developed cannot be used directly and, together with my colleague Dr. Gasser (KTH, Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden), we are implementing my elasticity model into a Finite Element code, and explore the possibility to model complex soft tissues for a variety of loading configurations.

"This project will investigate operating system scheduling algorithms for concurrent commercial applications and multi-instance virtual machine (VM) workloads on chip multiprocessors. 



Chip multiprocessing (CMP) systems are emerging as popular computing platforms due to their superior performance and power efficiency. Unlike conventional processors, chip multiprocessors employ fine-grained sharing of their internal resources. They run multiple tasks (i.e., processes or threads) on the same physical chip, and the tasks share the cache and other processor's components. Operating system scheduling - that is, the assignment of tasks to processors - has been shown effective at producing performance improvements on chip multiprocessors, because a scheduler defines how tasks share the processor's internal resources. Operating system scheduling is an attractive vehicle, because changes to the operating system software can be deployed more quickly and at lower expense than any solution that requires changes to the hardware. 



This project will investigate scheduling algorithms for two important workload types that were not studied extensively in the past: concurrent commercial applications and multi-instance VM workloads. These workloads will be used much on CMP systems, because their inherent parallelism dovetails with the parallel design of CMP hardware. We will design, implement and evaluate scheduling algorithms that target CMP systems' performance and usability for these workloads. 



Our initial research will address adaptations to existing operating systems, assuming that we cannot change the hardware or applications.  However, in the long run we hope to gain insight into how all system components can be adapted or redesigned to assure the most productive functioning of CMP systems.

"Kimberlites are the most deep-seated magmas (>150 km depth) that form primary deposits of diamonds. They fill carrot-shape pipes found only within continents. The origin of kimberlites is linked to processes in the deep mantle. Kimberlites transport diamonds from the Earth's mantle to the surface and partially dissolve them during the ascent. The dissolution impacts the commercial value of diamonds and the diamond grade of a kimberlite pipe. Volatile-rich nature of kimberlites plays an important role in diamond dissolution. It is not well known how much and what kind of volatiles kimberlites contain. Lack of such knowledge obscures our understanding of the origin of kimberlites. The proposed research investigates volatile content and fluid system of kimberlite magmas and the mantle fluid, and uses this information to put new constraints on the origin, primary melt composition and mantle source of kimberlites; to learn about conditions during emplacement and the mechanism of kimberlite eruption at the surface; and to understand what causes diamond destruction in the mantle. The program will use a new method based on the relationship between the fluid phase of kimberlite magma and the surface features on diamonds discovered in my recent experimental study to investigate fluid system of natural kimberlites. The results of my experiments show that the H2O/CO2 ratio on the fluid determines the type of dissolution features on diamonds. After experimental calibration of the new method, natural diamond parcels from Lac de Gras kimberlites (N.W.T., Canada) will be used to collect detailed data on the diamond surface features in order to determine composition and evolution of magmatic fluid in these kimberlites. The research will also use traditional analytical techniques to study mineralogy, geochemistry and petrography of the Lac de Gras kimberlites and kimberlite indicator minerals in order to find some geochemical fluid indicators and to understand the role of magmatic fluid in the crystallization and eruption of kimberlite magmas. The obtained data will provide better understanding of the origin of kimberlites, processes in subcratonic mantle, will help to predict preservation and quality of diamonds in a kimberlite pipe.

"In a recent study, the Canadian Academy of Engineers has made several recommendations concerning the pursuit of clean energy pathways for Canada's future. One of these recommendations is that Canada re-establish a research program to pursue fusion energy which is the ultimate abundant and clean energy source for mankind. The current proposal is the first step towards establishing a Canadian research effort in Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) focused on the pursuit of a promising new concept called fast ignition. We are fortunate that many leading laboratories in the world still view Canada as a potential important player in the quest for fusion energy and are thus still willing to help us in the development of such a fusion research capability. In parallel, we are currently developing a major proposal for an Alberta/Canada Fusion Energy Institute, which

has been forwarded to officials in the province of Alberta and the federal government. However, we must start building our research capacity in this area now and we are requesting funding in the present proposal to continue a research program in collaboration with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. This program will investigate the generation, transport and deposition of fast electron and proton energy which is required for the fast ignition process. Our expertise in k-alpha x-ray generation and quantitative measurements of x-rays will serve to determine the actual number densities of electrons at each stage of generation, transport and deposition into high density materials. There is little doubt that fast ignition can work to ignite the fuel pellet from a hot spot heated via these beams in a process similar to applying a match to fuel. However, the critical question is how efficiently can the energy be transferred from a 10 picosecond fast ignition laser pulse into this ignition spot using either electrons or protons, which are required to penetrate into the highly compressed target core where the laser light cannot reach. The proposed research work will help to answer these questions, establishing the required scaling laws for Fast Ignition and will make a significant step towards the goal of achieving controlled fusion energy on earth.","Alternative energy resources","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Energy"

"Rapid advances in the production and amplification of ultrashort optical pulses have enabled the generation of multi-terawatt pulses with small laboratory scale laser systems.  The duration of these laser pulses can be as short as 25 femtoseconds, a light pulse whose total length is measured in tens of microns.  The peak instantaneous power of 10 terawatts is equivalent to several times the total electrical generating capacity of the whole world for one brief instant.  This power when focused into micron size spots leads to extraordinarily strong relativistic interactions of the coherent laser light and matter.  Pressures and densities are created which only exist in the centre of stellar media and accelerating electric field gradients of GeV per centimetre are created.  The present research proposal will explore the fundamental physical processes occurring in the interaction of these high intensity laser pulses and matter, a new area identified as High Energy Density Physics, and investigate a number of phenomena occurring at these extreme intensities including:  1) generation and acceleration of GeV electrons via wakefield acceleration in plasma guide channels, 2) generation of high brightness proton beams for pinpoint radiation therapy of cancer tumors, 3) generation of radioisotopes on demand, 4) generation of high brightness femtosecond x-ray pulses for phase contrast microscopy, 5) generation of femtosecond electron jets for time resolved electron radiographic studies and 6) the generation, transport and energy deposition from electron and proton beams for fast ignition fusion energy. All of these new phenomena are leading to a new paradigm of tabletop particle accelerators, tabletop synchrotron sources and tabletop nuclear physics.  A key enabling technology for all of these application areas is a robust, efficient, high energy, high repetition rate, ultrashort pulse laser source and the project will develop and demonstrate such a source based on newly emerging diode pumped ceramic disk laser technology.  One of the major overall goals of the research is to advance Fast Ignition which could lead to the rapid advancement of Laser Fusion Energy giving us a long term solution for our growing green house gas and energy crises.

"Sensorimotor disturbances resulting from adult-onset central nervous system damage (Parkinson's Disease (PD) or stroke) include disorders in muscle tone (rigidity, spasticity) and movement deficits. In particular, coordination of movement is also affected by lesions of the vestibular system. Our team of collaborating researchers from McGill and University of Montreal will investigate how treatment of these deficits may be improved based on the knowledge of basic central control mechanisms underlying motor actions. We will focus on three central characteristics of disordered motor control: (a) Deficits in central regulation of stretch-reflex thresholds in the double-joint arm system that may underlie muscle weakness, rigidity, spasticity and incoordination of motions of different arm joints in PD and stroke; (b) Deficits in compensatory mechanisms normally used to reach the same motor goal (""motor equivalency"") regardless of the number of body segments involved in the motor action in patients with PD, stroke and vestibulo-deficiency; (c) Deficits in anticipatory, predictive control during prehension in PD and stroke. Based on the experimental analysis of these central aspects of arm movement deficits (4 experiments in total), we will elaborate 3 diagnostic tests that evaluate the central stretch reflex threshold regulation as well as compensatory and predictive control in these neurological patients. We plan to adapt the tests for clinical use. Research will be carried out at two Universities and at 4 hospitals affiliated with the CRIR (Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation). Physiotherapists from our group and CRIR physicians will assist in the projects.

"The aim of this research program is to diminish the gap in the understanding of the basic principles underlying the ability of the nervous system to control multiple muscles and degrees of freedom of the body in a coherent and task-specific way. Based on the previous research funded by NSERC, we successfully verified and further developed the threshold control theory of motor control. Applied to actions involving the whole body, this theory suggests that the electromyographic (EMG) activity of multiple skeletal muscles emerges from the comparison of the actual configuration (Q) of the body with its internal geometric image or referent (R) configuration modified by the brain according to task demands. The difference between these configurations can be considered as a global factor influencing the EMG activity of all skeletal muscles of the body. Local biomechanical and neurophysiological factors (e.g., autogenic and heterogenic reflexes) combined with the global factor diversify muscular EMG patterns. It was also assumed that, to produce a motor action, the nervous system shifts the threshold (virtual) position of an appropriate effector (e.g. the hand). In response, the emerging neural and muscular activity tends to minimize the difference between the actual and the virtual position of the effector, in the limits defined by internal and external constrains. Each element of the neuromuscular system may or may not be involved in the action depending on its ability to diminish the difference between the virtual and the actual position of the effector(s). These ideas offer a solution to the ill-posed redundancy problem in the control of multiple muscles and body segments. The present research proposal is designed to test the applicability of these new ideas to the production, first, of different hand-wrist gestures and, second, to a sequence of actions associated with the transition from sitting to standing and walking. Testing will involve both experimental analysis and mathematical modeling of these actions. The project may help not only in the understanding of the basic principles of motor control but also in designing muti-joint artificial limbs in prosthetics and robotics.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Integrative Animal Biology"

"Bridges form an integral part of Canada's infrastructure and economy.  However, 40% of the nation's bridges are older than 30 years.  Resources simply do not exist to replace aging bridges yet their condition must be maintained at an acceptable level to effectively manage the risk to the general public.  Recent bridge collapses and expos�s on the state of the nation's infrastructure highlight the urgency for solutions to these problems.

     Steel reinforcing bars have evolved markedly since the wide-scale introduction of reinforced concrete construction in the late nineteenth century.  Aging bridge members may have been built with reinforcing bars that do not meet current specifications, and/or construction details that do not meet required standards for bond and development.  Although bond dictates member capacity and failure mode, there is a lack of code criteria and logically consistent information relating to historical reinforcing bars and construction details. A gap in engineering knowledge has therefore been identified.

     The research program includes both experimental and analytical studies to: establish empirically-based proposed code provisions for the bond and development of historical reinforcement types, and establish a bond stress-slip relationship for plain bars that can be incorporated into sophisticated analysis models to validate the mechanics of bond and the proposed code provisions.  The knowledge gained in the 94 years since the first landmark study on bond will be used to update the ability to assess reinforced concrete members.  The goal is to establish the mechanics of bond and provide guidance and provisions for bond and development for the evaluation and rehabilitation of reinforced concrete members.  This achievement will allow for more accurate evaluations and thus more economical rehabilitations of the nation's bridges.  A significant potential cost savings to Canadian taxpayers and an improvement to the overall safety of the nation's bridges will result.  The proposed work provides an application of knowledge for practical purposes and is within NSERC's mandate to consider the use of the results by the end user which, in this case, is the practicing engineering community.

DIVAs will be used in three composed stage works of increasing complexity to be performed in Canada and internationally, starting with one performer initially and culminating in three performers simultaneously using their natural voices as well as teh hand-based synthesizer. Training performances will be used to study the processes associated with skill acquisition, the coordination of multiple ""voices"" within and among performers, and the intelligibility and realism of this new form of audio/visual production.

"Computer simulation of human anatomy is expected to become an increasingly useful tool in medical research, diagnosis, and treatment. This project will improve the state of the art of such simulation by creating a complete computer model of the mouth and throat region, and using it to study several important medical disorders. These include sleep apnea (interrupted breathing during sleep), which afflicts an estimated twelve million Americans and can lead to complications such as heart disease; difficulty in swallowing as caused by stroke; and treating impairments of chewing and swallowing caused by surgery. Treatment of these conditions can be difficult because they involve complicated interactions between the nerves, muscles, and tissues of the mouth-throat region. Our model will help us better understand these interactions.

To begin, we will create the model itself, which will contain the jaw, tongue, lips, throat, and surrounding structures and simulate their physical behaviour and motion. This will then allow us to answer questions such as ""how do the nerves and muscles work together when we chew and swallow?"" and ""under what conditions will the tongue fall back and close the airway?"". New techniques will be developed for improving the simulation's speed, with the goal of making it interactive. In collaboration with medical specialists, our model will be used to investigate causes and treatments for the medical conditions described above. Finally, we will study how medical imaging data can be used fit the model to individual patients, ultimately allowing it to be used as a clinical treatment tool. For example, a patient-specific model may be able to predict the side effects of surgery, or determine if a sleep apnea patient is a good candidate for treatment with a nighttime dental fixture.

Our project is highly interdisciplinary, combining computer science, physics, biomechanics, physiology, anatomy, and medicine, and is expected to make important contributions to biomedicine, computer simulation, medical image processing, and the understanding and treatment of a variety of medical disorders.

"Mark Weisers' vision of ubiquitous computing is emerging with increasing adoption of information applications and devices such as email, maps, audio/visual media, mobile phones, media players, game consoles, laptops, home servers and so on. We will know when this vision becomes fully realized and most beneficial to society when information technologies are acquired with more consideration of how well they integrate with a person's lifestyle rather than by their functionality; in essence, the technology becomes mundane, blending into people's way of thinking and living. This research creates technologies and approaches to support large-scale digital lifestyles based on new mental models and metaphors of content and applications to achieve this. Ultimately, these metaphors provide a shift from ubiquitous computing to ubiquitous media and metaphors.

   An array of user-centred, designer-centred and technologist-centred approaches will be used to establish different interaction contexts such as media contexts, security contexts, synchronous and asynchronous communication contexts, game contexts, entertainment contexts that span Home, Work, Oldenburg's Third Place and Transit areas using novel application and file systems that can support the complex set of representations and transitions between them. The information contexts will primarily be focused on: home including families, and shared living scenarios; third places such as coffee shops, stadiums, and theatres; transit spaces such as cars or large public areas, as well as work places. Providing new interaction paradigms, information spaces and digital lifestyle architecture that span these physical places supports an integrated information lifestyle for users giving more control and enjoyment of their digital artifacts. This approach will be investigated in two specific domains, media and e-health, as they provide important areas that impact people's daily lives and provide a rich research arena in which to find generalizable research contributions.

"The principle objective of the proposed research is to advance techniques in formal proof of properties of programs, programming languages, and policies.  For individual programs, proving that they meet certain properties contributes to a very high level of assurance that they will behave as expected.  For properties of programming languages, it is well-known that those that are formally proven to be sound can better provide a solid basis for building software systems that are reliable and secure.  Examples where policies play an increasingly important role include assuring that software that processes health or other personal data respects privacy requirements, and assuring that software that is used in the administration of businesses respects government financial and security regulations.

     The techniques I will focus on to meet this objective include the use of higher-order abstract syntax as a representation technique for languages and programs, and the automation of proof search.  These techniques will be developed in the context of targeted applications.  In particular, I will focus on applications where it is most likely to be possible to scale such techniques and apply them in practice to industrial software systems, and on applications where it is most crucial that policy constraints are met with a high degree of assurance.

     To meet my objectives, the work will be broken down into four projects, each with subprojects that will vary from shorter term to more speculative longer term research: (1) reasoning using higher-order abstract syntax, (2) foundational proof-carrying code, (3) a theorem proving approach to privacy-sensitive information flow, and (4) analysis and verification of policies.

A microscale Particle Image Velocimetry (micro-PIV) measurement system is required to measure the velocity fields of the fluid surrounding blood cells in the micro-fluidic devices. This equipment will be used to generate high-quality experimental data to study in vitro the effects of cell interactions on blood flow, and to validate mechanical models we are developing. The acquisition of the requested infrastructure will have the potential to significantly improve the current state of knowledge in the area of microcirculation. Also at this point, the applicant's students need this equipment to complete their research.

"Microcirculation in the human body, which is composed of numerous vessels with diameters less than 50 micrometers, is the main exchange site between blood and tissues. Knowledge of microcirculation is essential to understanding numerous pathologies and testing therapeutic solutions. The behaviour of blood in microcirculation is very complex because it cannot be considered as a liquid, but rather as a collection of interacting particles. Red blood cell circulation and interaction in micro-vessels is of great interest. Moreover, red blood cells may adversely affect blood behaviour, and as a consequence, blood flow if they are too abundant, less deformable or if they tend to aggregate abnormally. 



The study of blood flow in microcirculation represents a considerable challenge, on the one hand because many weaknesses in experimental measurements are present (cell density at physiological hematocrit prevents direct optical study), on the other hand because the complexity of the micromechanics makes the development of global mathematical models (fluid flow with a large number of deformable cells) very challenging. Up until now, in the absence of proven numerical methods which can be used over a large range of physiological conditions, models are limited to studying the interactions among a small number of particles. 



We have developed a simple model capable of mimicking natural red blood cell aggregation. This mechanical model can deal with a large number of red blood cells sheared in a simple flow. The aim of our research is to continue to develop mathematical models of cell interactions in a complex flow scenario for microcirculation suited for analyzing the effect of blood cell properties on microcirculation.

"With shortage of crude oil and global warming, energy is a central issue facing the world today. Fuel cells have emerged as a promising clean-energy technology that may contribute to resolving the looming energy crisis. A hydrogen fuel cell reacts hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity. The obvious benefit is zero harmful emission, the only product being water. When used in automobiles and household appliances, fuel cells are quiet and exceptionally clean, and avoid most of the environmental pollution from burning fossil fuels. Fuel cell technology has found some niche applications already, but large-scale commercialization is still hampered by high cost, poor durability and performance. A key factor that limits the power output is the management of vapor and liquid water in fuel cells. Too little water causes membrane dry-out and loss of

conductivity while too much floods the reaction sites and inhibits the chemical reaction. But water transport through the porous layers of the fuel cell is a very complex problem, involving the simultaneous flow of gases and water through irregular micron-size pores. Without a clear grasp of the underlying physics, fuel cell design, especially design of the ""gas-diffusion media"", has largely been an empirical art up to now. The proposed work seeks a fundamental solution to the above problems through two complementary stages of modeling and design optimization. In the scientifically-oriented stage one, we use computer simulations to faithfully represent water and gas transport at the microscopic pore scale. This knowledge is then used in stage two to design ""smart gas-diffusion media"" with drastically improved transport properties, which will produce

superior power output for the fuel cell. This project will not only advance our scientific knowledge of gas-liquid transport, but help accelerate commercialization of fuel cell technology and further strengthen Canada's leadership in the area of clean energy.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Energy"
"Silicon-based semiconductor brought about the revolution in electronics and computing in the late 20th century. A new revolution in information and computing technology is being fomented by the idea of replacing electrons by photons as carriers of information. Photons are faster than electrons and can convey huge amounts of data with low power loss. The linchpin in the new optoelectronic technology is the photonic crystal, made of periodically repeating elements of disparate dielectric constants. By steering light along precise paths through such crystals, we can produce the photonic counterpart of semiconductors---photonic chips and optical integrated circuits---which will potentially revolutionize telecommunication and computing technologies. 

    Making photonic crystals has proved very challenging. The two most promising routes are through ""inverse opals"" of self-assembled micron-size solid particles, and through colloidal crystals of self-assembled microdrops. The first is complex and expensive, and has technical difficulties in infiltrating the interstices between solid particles and in drying the crystal without cracking. The second method avoids these problems, and allows mass-production using inexpensive precursors such as oil and surfactants. Its difficulty lies in producing and assembling highly uniform microdrops. Fractionating polydisperse emulsions rarely reduces the polydispersity below 10%, and size variations lead to severe defects in the final crystal.

    We propose novel strategies for making colloidal crystals that overcome these problems. The key idea is in-situ generation and assembly of precisely monodisperse microdrops on a substrate with periodical patterns of micro-topography, variable wettability and temperature control. The proposed work consists of numerical simulations to demonstrate the feasibility of these strategies and laboratory experiments to validate the computations. This will lay the scientific foundation for further development in photonic technologies. The research will provide excellent training for 2 Ph.D. students and 2 Masters students.

"This research deals with the fundamental issues of novel nanostructured facilitated transport membranes to separate gases that are difficult and costly to perform with traditional technologies. In facilitated transport, the permselectivity to a target component in a mixture is enhanced by selective and reversible complexation with the facilitating agents imbedded in the membrane. The membranes are targeted at 1) olefin/paraffin separation (to replace or complement with the traditional energy-intensive low temperature distillation), 2) O2 enrichment from air (for enhanced combustion), and 3) CO2 capture from flue gas (for greenhouse gas emission control). They are all directly related to Canada's strategic development of innovative technologies in the resource and energy industries. 



The proposed research is highly original and innovative in that nonporous active base membranes are used to retain the carrier molecules (in place of microporous substrate or ion exchange membranes used in conventional facilitated transport), thereby overcoming the problems associated with carrier loss or restrained mobility of carrier molecules in traditional facilitated transport membranes. Based on preliminary results of proof-of-concept studies, a technology review and assessment conducted by the Canadian industry revealed that these membranes hold great promise as a potential ""breakthrough"" technology. This research not only contributes to knowledge and training of highly qualified personnel, it addresses directly Canada's industrial needs for fundamental understanding of the novel membranes required to develop and commercialize this Canadian-owned technology.

"In genetics, the ultimate goal is to understand the biological mechanism behind the complex system through genetic studies so that we can benefit from the knowledge derived from these research activities. The common theme of my research is to develop statistical methods for integrating diverse types of genomic data arising from different genetic study designs (e.g. genetic marker data, micro-array data and etc).

My research can be broadly classified into two areas: complex disease mapping (two linkage study projects and one association study project); and genotyping using pooling DNA (one project). 

Current methods for linkage analysis may lead to significantly biased results when densely spaced markers are used because these methods do not account for the strong association among tightly spaced markers. In one project, I propose that a graphical model be used to characterize these associations. In my other linkage analysis project, I will apply the theory of level crossing of a Gaussian process to model the excursion peak process for detecting the chromosome that contains a disease gene. My association study project involves jointly analyzing data from both related and unrelated cases and controls using a likelihood-based approach that incorporates the correlation among related subjects.

In genotyping, the cost for a single marker is low, but individual genotyping of a large number of markers is still expensive when a large number of subjects are studied. Pooling individuals' DNA together for genotyping has been advocated as it can effectively reduce cost, labor and time. For example, pooling the individuals at one time may reduce the cost two-fold. However, the challenge of the pooling approach lies in the precision of the allele frequency estimate based on the group of the individuals pooled together. In my genotyping project, I will focus on the pooling of two individuals' DNA. I particular, I will develop a novel classification algorithm for determining the number of alleles that each pair of pooled individuals have.","Mathematical sciences","Statistical Sciences"
"Respiration is an essential biological function of living animals. The rhythmic behavior of respiration is controlled by neuronal networks of the specific nerve cells named central pattern generators (CPG). 



Specificity of synaptic connections between the CPG neurons is critical for generating and maintaining respiratory rhythmic activities. However, how the rhythmic activity of respiratory CPG neurons is generated and regulated remains unknown. Lymnaea stagnalis, a fresh-water pond snail, offers a simple biological system in which the rhythmic activity of the lung breathing is controlled by three CPG neurons. We recently established a soma-soma synapse model which allows us to study the respiratory rhythmic activity in culture dish. We also developed a chronic hypoxia snail model which exhibits adaptive facilitation of respiratory activity in whole animal. Thus, the snail becomes a unique model to study how respiratory rhythm is generated and regulated at the multiple levels. Using the snail as a model, we propose to investigate the role of specific genes/proteins in regulating properties of the CPG neurons. We will also study the hypoxia-induced stress factors involved in rhythmic regulation of respiratory networks, using innovative experimental approaches including electrophysiological, molecular biological and optical imaging techniques. We anticipate that these studies will provide novel insights into the generation and control of respiratory activities from the molecular level to animal behavior in a single system. The information gained from this research will ultimately advance our understanding of not only respiratory physiology, but also potential treatment of respiratory disorders.

"Nearly all experimental work in infant language development has focused on monolingual infants. Yet, due to immigration, official language policies, and cultural preferences and norms, many infants are being raised in a bilingual environment.  The task of learning two languages from birth is potentially not an easy one, as the infants have to acquire more language sounds and words than an infants learning one language.  Despite these potential difficulties, bilingual infants do pass language milestones, like onset of first word, at comparable times to monolinguals and have similar sized vocabularies as monolinguals, when words from both languages are taken into account.  However, relatively little is known about the learning processes involved in acquiring the sounds and words of two languages. Do bilinguals take a different path to reach similar goals as monolinguals? I propose two sets of studies examining bilinguals' acquisition and use of phonemes, the smallest meaningful units of sound in a language.  The aim is to ascertain how infants learning two languages acquire these sounds (e.g., [b] and [d]) and how they use, or misuse, phonemes to disambiguate similar-sounding words in their lexicon (e.g., ""bog"" and ""dog"").  The first set of studies will explore models of acquisition by investigating if: 1) monolinguals can learn phonemes in a laboratory-induced ""bilingual"" setting and 2) whether bilingual infants' natural linguistic exposure, which differs greatly from that of monolinguals, leads to direct differences in phoneme discrimination between these learner populations. The second set of studies will investigate bilingual infants' phoneme use in early word learning. Will any differences seen in phoneme discrimination in the first year of life lead to differences in the use of those phonemes in word learning in the second year of life? Through studies with bilingual infants, we can gain a deeper understanding of language development in all infants. In addition, the findings that will emerge from these studies will have practical implications for parents and educators by revealing how young bilinguals acquire language, and identifying sounds that may give them difficulty.",Psychology,"Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences"

"It is accepted today that self-assembly and self-organization processes are the thread that connects the reductionism of chemical reactions to the complexity and emergence of a living dynamic system. Unraveling these processes may lead not only to a better understanding of nature's approach to generating supramolecular architectures with predefined dimensions and properties, but also to technological applications in engineering, science, and medicine. 

         The conceptualization of an organized state of matter requires in-debt understanding not only of chemical reactivity but also of the chemical information embedded in the molecules in the form of charges, dipoles, and other functional elements necessary to translate chemical information into functional superstructures. Towards this goal we propose to investigate 5 inter-related projects. The first deals with controlling the inner diameter of self-assembled rosette nanotubes (RNTs) through the design and chemical synthesis of small organic molecules, as well as the length of the RNTs through automated organic synthesis. The second project consists in utilizing the RNTs to generate monodisperse metallic nanoparticles endowed with important catalytic properties. The third topic deals with the study of a new family of nanotubules through a novel self-assembly mechanism. The fourth project will focus on understanding the supramolecular polymorphism of a synthetic molecule that self-assembles into, RNTs, nanospheroids, nanodisks, nanotoroids, or nanobowties, depending on the experimental conditions. The fifth project will deal with our discovery of a family of achiral molecules that display supramolecular chirality upon self-assembly.  The fact that this is a physically impossible phenomenon suggests a novel underlying physical concept that we wish to uncover. 

       This program has contributed to a highly multidisciplinary environment for my group. In addition to exploring new aspects of organic chemistry, the students learn the art of supramolecular engineering, and state-of-the-art materials characterization techniques.","Advancement of knowledge","Inorganic & Organic Chemistry"
"Attention and emotion are important for virtually every aspect of human life. In normal functioning, the interaction of attention and emotion processes guide perception, influence decision making, and are critical for cognitive control and emotional self-regulation. Our survival, quite literally, depends on proper functioning of these systems. The prevailing notion of how attention and emotion are related is guided primarily by the evidence that affective states and emotionally salient stimuli can impact the allocation of attention. Much less is known about the impact of attention on emotion. A recent series of behavioural results suggest that visual attention can in fact produce affective responses for otherwise neutral objects and faces. For example, ignoring an abstract visual pattern (versus attending to it) leads to a subsequent emotional devaluation of that pattern. The goal of the cognitive neuroscience research proposed here is to establish how visual attention impacts emotion. A series of purely cognitive-behavioural studies will be used to reveal the fundamental characteristics of the effects of attention on emotional responses. A complementary set of cognitive neuroimaging studies will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to reveal the network of brain regions that allow attention and emotion to operate together in this way. The results of this program of research are expected to lead to a better understanding of the cognitive and neural mechanisms responsible for interactions between attention and emotion, and thereby provide a foundation for addressing impairments in function that occur when these systems are affected by illness, neurological disorders, and stroke.

"At any given moment in time there is considerably more visual information available in the environment than we can efficiently deal with. From the visual information impinging on our retinae, the light sensitive tissue at the back of our eyes, our brain selects only a subset to reach conscious awareness. One of the major selection processes is happening in the attentional system which will highlight certain information in the environment while at the same time suppressing the rest. The main questions we will be addressing over the next five years are concerned with this initial selection process: What are the mechanisms behind it? What are the limitations and how flexible is the process? Can typically hard-wired selection processes be overwritten by an individual's goals? Can the rules for attentional selection be learned implicitly and is this as effective as conscious awareness of rules? How do attentional processes interact with other cognitive faculties such as working memory (the ability to maintain information online after it has been removed from view)? Do both faculties show the same capacity limits? How do they interfere with each other when one is taxed? Furthermore, we will show how attentional and working memory processes are implemented in the brain and to what extent they share the same neural resources. This in turn will advance our understanding of some cognitive disorders observed after brain damage.

"The theory of plate tectonics describes how the rigid plates at the surface of the Earth are formed and destroyed, and how they move over a time scale of millions of years. These plates, which may contain continents or oceans or both, make up a rigid outer shell of the Earth called the lithosphere. My research involves improving our understanding of how continental lithosphere forms, how it preserved, and how it has been changed after its formation. I am focussing on studying the lithosphere of the Precambrian shield in central Canada that was formed between about  one and three billion years ago.  

    )	

Seismic and electromagnetic geophysical methods can provide detailed images of the upper several hundred kilometres of the Earth. These images can show how how thick the lithosphere is, how heterogenous it is, how different parts of the lithosphere were amalgamated, and whether the lithosphere has been significantly changed since it first formed. My research involves using electromagnetic methods which provide images of the electrical conductivity. Studies involve recording and analyzing low-frequency electromagnetic (EM) signals produced in the ionosphere (often during auroral activity) and in the atmosphere (during thunderstorms). Signals with different frequencies flow through the ground at different depths enabling the measurement of electrical conductivity over a range of depths. The varying conductivity within the Earth depends on the presence of conductive minerals such as oxides, sulphides, and graphite and the on presence of fluids such as water and magma. In turn this information is related to the types of rock present and the geological structure and history.

"My research program focuses on understanding the genetic basis of evolutionary change in fishes. In particular I am concentrating on two major components of the evolutionary process.  Firstly, I study how genetic differences among individuals lead to variation in their appearance and numbers and survival of their offspring (fitness).  Secondly, I determine how those genetic differences can become partitioned between populations when they begin to diverge genetically into different species. I examine different forms (morphs) of Arctic charr from Iceland that differ in appearance and ecology, and live together in different lakes. In particular I am determining the way in which these different forms might have arisen, and also investigating the role of such forms in the origin of new species.  Arctic charr continue to be models for this work because of their remarkable phenotypic and genetic diversity and the ability to produce experimental families.  

Knowledge of the genes that control the appearance of Arctic charr and how their appearance is shaped through the evolutionary agent of natural selection is needed to evaluate the role of such morph variation in population divergence.  First, I will search for chromosomal regions that influence body morphology as well as the size and shape of individual bones of the head.  I will also find the genomic location of key genes that are known to influence head shape and the number and size of muscle fibres, which differ among the forms of charr.   Second, I will determine if natural selection favours fish with certain body shapes and sizes.  This will involve sampling fish from two Icelandic lakes over three years and seeing if fish with typical morph appearance have higher condition as estimated by their growth rate and the amount of energy and lipid in their tissues. Finally, I will look at the genetic constitution of morphs to see if their genes have been influenced by natural selection. The knowledge generated by this research is essential to tacking the question of whether these morphs of Arctic charr are evolutionarily stable or whether we are witnessing the birth of new species.

"The increasing effects of global warming are greatest in polar environments. How will Arctic marine ecosystems respond to the increasing physical affects of global warming and will change occur gradually or will it come quickly? Using environmental changes associated with rising temperatures as the explanatory variable and changes in distribution and abundance of marine mammals as the dependent variable, I propose to study their interaction. I will measure energy and fitness connections to population changes by looking at how energy moves through the food web and at which trophic level is energy concentrated. To understand fitness, I will use genetics and reproductive success. The idea is to apply this knowledge to understand energy and fitness changes associated with global warming and Arctic marine mammals. Ultimately, I plan to build models to predict how marine mammal populations will change in numbers and where they will live. Models will integrate knowledge and help us understand whether Arctic marine ecosystems will resist change, change quickly, or change in a constant manner with global warming. To better understand these questions I will use satellite telemetry, biological collections from Inuit harvests, and diet studies. Combining this information into mathematical models provides testable predictions on how climate change will unfold in the arctic. Understanding how polar marine ecosystems change will help us to develop adaptive conservation and management programs for whales, seals, and the Inuit that rely on marine mammals for food and cultural sustenance.","Conservation and preservation","Evolution & Ecology"

"Carbohydrates were originally thought of as a source of energy and as molecules that play a structural role. The discovery of animal lectins, however, revealed that carbohydrates code for biological information. The information contained in carbohydrates is translated into a biological event by proteins known as lectins. The binding of lectins to carbohydrates is a key event in a myriad of biological processes such as cell migration and adhesion. 

Proteins belonging to one of the largest family of lectins known as the C-type lectins are key players in the immune system. C-type lectins have been extensively studied in a variety of white blood cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Neutrophils also express many C-type lectins but the role of these proteins in neutrophil biology remains an enigma. Neutrophils are important for the recognition and neutralization of pathogens and are also capable of modulating the behaviour of other cells of the immune system by secreting soluble factors and through cell-cell interactions.

Since C-type lectin receptors are essential for the functioning of the immune system, the characterization of neutrophils would be incomplete without knowledge of the role these receptors play in the many functions of this important leukocyte. The objective of this research program is, therefore, to identify and characterize the C-type lectins expressed by human neutrophils. Our research on C-type lectins in neutrophils has identified a receptor that potentially modulates the response of neutrophils to fungi and we have also identified a C-type lectin expressed in a subpopulation of neutrophils.

"SCADA networks are the backbone of most our critical infrastructure, allowing their operators to monitor and control the various components of their systems.  They provide a link between sensors and the centralized computer control systems that interpret, warn and in some cases automatically control parts of the infrastructure by sending commands on that same network to SCADA-aware actuators.  The availability and integrity of the data captured and sent on these networks is absolutely fundamental to the safe and reliable operation of our critical infrastructure.  Nowadays, SCADA sensory data and commands transit over computer networks much like those that have become common place in businesses and the Internet.  In fact, SCADA networks often piggy back on or are connected to these corporate networks and even to the Internet in order to facilitate remote management, unfortunately exposing them to many of the same threats.

The security of computer networks in their traditional and most common uses (electronic commerce, corporate information systems, Web, email, etc.) has been widely studied, and the consequence of threats such as Denial-of-Service attacks and computer hacking is well understood and is typically measured in terms of loss of availability or other quality of service metrics.  However, there has been relatively little research done on the quantitative impact on the critical infrastructure of the same threats to the computer systems that control them.  In this project, we study this problem in the case of electrical power grid control networks.  The equipment acquired with this grant will allow us to reproduce in the lab the behaviour of the electrical grid when we subject the control networks to various kinds of probable and realistic computer network attacks or disruptive events.  In particular, it will allow us to measure and model their impact in terms of electrical power delivered to customers (or lack thereof) rather than in the traditional measures of network quality of service (e.g. loss of bandwith, latency, etc.).  This will eventually allow electrical grid operators to determine how to best configure and protect their control computer networks in order to minimise impact on their customers.

"The main objective of this proposal is the improvement of our understanding of measures of performance in computer security through the study of the quantitative trade-offs between system and defensive performance, attack performance and characteristics of the environment in which they operate.



On the one side, we hope that a better understanding of the trade-offs between defensive performance and environment conditions for particular attacks, will help us discover which parameters of the environment (partially under our control) can be optimised to reduce the effectiveness of certain types of attack.  Such adjustments could include changes in network or server configuration, network protocols, traffic shaping, etc.



On the other, we hope that by studying the mutual influence between defensive and attack performance criteria, we will be able to predict what the ultimate ""equilibrium"" conditions are where both defences and attacks are optimal.  This provides a description of ""worst case scenario"" against for which we have to construct defences.



This research programme involves both theoretical work involving mathematical modelling using stochastic simulation techniques, and experimental work involving experiments in controlled laboratory conditions, and validation using training and test data sets obtained from real networks.

"Over the years, mine incidents have resulted in numerous deaths and injuries. These incidents have triggered

many occupational safety Acts in Canada and abroad with the objective to develop the technology to help avert,

or at least mitigate, future mine tragedies. The most important aspect of such Acts is providing reliable

communication, which has always been a challenge in underground mines due to changing topologies and

harsh environments, for miners before and after tragic incidents. In addition, disasters bring down electricity

and communications cables, block tunnels and cause fire. These may damage the communication

infrastructure, hampering rescue efforts and endangering lives. Survivable solutions using advanced

communication and sensor network technologies have to be in place to handle the situation.

The objective of this proposal, in partnership with Mine Radio Systems (MRS) Inc., is to research, design and

develop a highly reliable underground wireless network that will ensure miners' safety before and after

disasters. The proposed system will be capable of (1) providing highly reliable wireless communications in

mines during the normal course of operation (2) self-monitoring, optimization and diagnosis in order to detect

and predict impending failures and improve reliability (3) maintaining mine-wide operational integrity after an

incident such as a mine fire, roof fall or explosion and (4) supporting radio frequency identification (RFID)

based tracking and locating services for miners and assets before and after incidents. The prominent feature of

the proposed network will be having an independent monitoring sensor network that will help with system

optimization, preventive maintenance, disaster prediction/avoidance and recovery. The proposed highly reliable

"With telecommunication deregulations and technological advancements, traditional communication and media broadcasting services merge together. Cable television (CATV) providers geared to provide voice and Internet services over their hybrid-fiber coaxial network (HFC), entering the so called 'triple play' while, Telco's provide Internet and phone over their telephone networks. The need for bandwidth is higher than ever before, especially at the wake of high definition televisions (HDTV). Fast emerging fiber to the home (FTTH) promises broadband access delivered to our doorsteps. Fiber-wireless systems gain popularity as well, bringing the RF signal closer to the broadband wireless users. 



In all these access networks (HFC, FTTH and fiber-wireless) fiber is in the back end. Hundreds of video and audio signals are modulated on RF carriers and transmitted over fiber (radio-over-fiber). The fiber medium is often enhanced with wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and configured as passive optical networks (PON). Although fiber has enough bandwidth, other issues like nonlinear distortion; limited power handling capability; limited dynamic range; chromatic dispersion and large losses challenge the quality of service. The RF signal is essentially analog and signal reconstruction won't be possible to overcome the impairments in an end-to-end path. The research program targets on investigating signal distortions over optical access networks with an electrical last mile. The last mile could be (coaxial) cable or air. Electrical and optical domain signal processing techniques will be investigated to improve the quality of the multimedia signals delivered to the user. Results will be verified experimentally using existing lab facilities.

"Recent years have seen dramatic progress in the study of the core and nuclear properties of galaxies. The dynamical centers of galaxies have been found capable of hosting two seemingly disparate objects: supermassive black holes (SBHs) and compact nuclear star clusters (NSCs). In a drastic departure from previous beliefs, it has been discovered that both structures are common: galaxies lacking SBHs and/or NSCs are the exception, rather than the norm. Furthermore, the connection between SBHs and NSCs is deeper than one might have expected: both are linked to the global galactic properties by similar scaling relations; both contain the same fraction, ~0.3%, of the total galactic mass.



Theoretical work has shown that the structure and evolution of galaxies is profoundly affected by the presence of SBHs. The role of NSCs is still unclear, since very little is known about these enigmatic objects. The goal of this proposal is therefore to provide a secure observational characterization of NSCs, and seek their relation to SBHs and the global properties of their host galaxies. The results will help lay the solid observational foundations needed to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework of galaxy formation/evolution.

One important goal of this research is that it investigates how different grammatical inflections associated with verbs influences the activation of event knowledge in semantic memory. A second goal is to examine how verbal inflections interact with the temporal and causal structure of events to determine how people resolve the referents for pronouns - a process crucial to successful language comprehension. A third goal is to provide insight into how the two cerebral hemispheres process grammatical inflections and event knowledge jointly and individually to determine the critical process of understanding who is doing what to whom in sentences. Finally, this research uses Event-Related Brain Potential methodology (ERP) to provide insight into the neurocognitive underpinnings of these crucial processes during language comprehension on a millisecond time-scale.

"Bacteria are widely recognized as protagonists of a range of geochemical reactions in pristine and contaminated aqueous environments.   The behavior of bacteria as geochemically reactive ""agents provocateurs"" is engendered not only by their ubiquitous distribution and diverse metabolic capabilities, but also stems from their intrinsic cell-surface reactivity and ability to sorb a wide range of dissolved chemicals.  Much of our recent work has been on extreme environments (e.g., hot springs in the Andes, the Canadian High Arctic), but not to the exclusion of more ""normal"" ecosystems (e.g., groundwater springs) that help to define these extremes. Our studies have also been used to quantify the geochemical behavior of microorganisms as sorbents for dissolved mineral-forming elements, and as nucleation substrates for mineral precipitation.  Of immediate concern is exploration of bacteriogenic mineral precipitation reactions for sustainable natural remediation of fluoride (F-) in groundwater-supplied drinking water systems in India (where the crippling disease fluorosis is endemic), as well as assessment of the diversity of prokaryotic viruses (i.e., bacteriophage) in the deep subsurface and acid mine drainage environments, and their potential to prevent metal contaminant migration in aqueous systems through sorption and mineral precipitation reactions.  Studies will focus additionally on development of dynamic quantitative geospatial models for microbial Fe2+/Fe3+ redox cycling in precipitation-dissolution reactions involving silicate minerals, particularly in terms of coupled processes that contribute to the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.  This initiative represents a groundbreaking step forward for microbial geochemistry into a challenging new area of research focused on deciphering the complex spatial and temporal relationships that exist between microbial and geochemical processes in nature, and understanding impending consequences of disturbances associated with environmental change.","Earth sciences","Environmental Earth Sciences"
"Individual differences affect population growth, the evolution of reproductive strategies and the ecological consequences of environmental change and human exploitation.  My research on wild mammals quantifies variation in individual reproductive success, survival and physical characteristics, identifies the sources of that variation and explores its effects on population dynamics.  My research group combines theories and methods from ecology and evolution to understand how animals react to changing environments, including changes due to human activities and exploitation.  Our primary technique is lifetime monitoring of marked individuals, with detailed information on sex, age, pedigree, genotype, size, growth, reproductive success, social behavior and survival.  Study species include bighorn sheep, mountain goats, eastern grey kangaroos, caribou, chamois and brown bears.  Bighorn sheep at Ram Mountain have been affected by trophy hunting, and loss of genetic variability may have depressed population growth.  Sheep from another population were recently introduced to attempt a genetic rescue.  This experiment, combined with more restrictive hunting regulations, will explore if changes in the genetic make-up of the population will influence its dynamics.  I will examine how age, size, heterozygosity and social behavior affect the reproductive success of male bighorn sheep and kangaroos. Students will analyze decades of records of annual horn growth for thousands of harvested Stone's sheep from BC and chamois from Italy to determine how hunter selectivity, weather and other variables affect age- and sex-specific horn growth and survival.  I will experimentally study the costs of reproduction in female kangaroos in collaboration with an ongoing program of artificial contraception, and examine the ecological causes and consequences of variation in litter size in brown bears.  My research has important implications for conservation. It provides clues to changes in population size and structure, and long-term data to assess the impacts of global change and of management decisions on the ecology and evolution of animal populations.

"In northern Canada, sport hunting by non-residents generates substantial revenues for many communities.  Most non-resident sport hunters seek 'trophy' animals, typically males in their prime, with large horns or antlers.  Although the demographic impacts of this harvest are generally thought to be minimal, increasing concern is being raised over its evolutionary consequences.  Because trophy hunting likely removes high-quality males that would normally have high reproductive success, it may be a selective pressure against large horns or antlers.  By removing high-quality males before they can reproduce, trophy hunting may also decrease the genetic diversity of hunted populations.  My research on Stone's sheep in northern BC and on migratory caribou in northern Qu�bec/Labrador will assess the possible impacts of trophy hunting on the morphology and development of ungulates.  My students and I will analyze data on yearly horn growth of Stone's rams harvested over the past 30 years and collect new data to determine the impacts of climate, vegetation productivity and hunter preference on age-specific horn development.  We will compare the size of caribou antlers to hunter type (native harvesters VS nonresident trophy hunters), body condition, population density, climate and productivity.  Our results will ensure that sport hunting by nonresidents in the North will remain ecologically and evolutionary sustainable while continuing to provide revenues for northern Canadians.

"A unique active control system for reducing vibration and noise on helicopters will be demonstarted in whirl tower (or centrifugal) tests and computer simulations. The system was developed by the two applicants at Carleton University and stands out from other control systems by being the first one to employ both Flow Control and Structural Control devices on each helicopter blade. For this reason, the concept is named as Hybrid Control and its main benefits are that it allows to obtain superior effiociency in reducing vibration as well as promises to be the first system to reduce vibration and noise simulataneously. A key element of the Hybrid Control concept is the Active Pitch Link, which is the first ever working prototype of a device which can control the structural response of the blade. The unique concept of the Hybrid Control system as well as the design of the Active Pitch Link has been patent protected and designed to be Fail Safe in the case of power output or actuator failure. If the demonstrations outlined in this proposal are successful, it will open the door towards commercialization of the product, which is envisioned to be manufactured and supplied to helicopter manufacturers by a Canadian spin-off company emloying about 40-55 people.

"My current research interests lie in the general area of nonlinear partial differential equations, covering a broad spectrum of methods ranging from rigorous analysis to asymptotics and  numerics.  In particular, I have interests in the compressible Euler  and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky-type equations.



Regarding the compressible Euler equations, I would mainly like to investigate from new viewpoints the global existence of unique entropy solutions for these equations. This is a notorious problem and has attracted a great deal of interest and effort during the last 50 years. The main idea that I want to pursue is to use a type of regularization that hasn't been used before for compressible fluids. This type of regularization was previously used by Leray (1934) to conclude global existence of weak solutions of the $3D$ incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.  My collaborator, H. Bhat (Columbia), and I already applied these ideas to the Burgers equation and the results are very encouraging. 

 

 The other direction of my research program is to work on improving existing energy bounds for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) and other related equations. The issue of deriving sharp energy bounds for the KS equation is also a very hard problem. There is only a handful of papers that made a contribution to the subject over the last two decades and the results are quite far from what is believed to be the best bound, as observed from numerical experiments. I have very recently taken an interest in this equation and I want to pursue this research direction, with perhaps more modest expectations at the beginning, when I want to focus on improving bounds for the various  modified KS equations proposed in the literature and also tackle the multidimensional case.

"The ability to self-localize with vision is an important capability that humans and animals possess, there is a need to implement vision in automatic systems such as robotics and Augmented Reality (AR).  Mobile AR holds the promise of providing new ways of viewing data and electronic content annotated over the real world,

and has been recognized by many including MIT's Technology Review as one of the top ten emerging technologies.  For a mobile robot to navigate or an AR system to operate in an unknown and unprepared environment, the pose (position and orientation) must be constantly measured.  Computer vision can be used to build a model of the environment and localize within it, this model can be shared with other robots or AR devices.  Computer vision has seen major recent developments that suggest a breakthrough in these areas to produce real world robotics and AR systems may soon be possible.  



The goals of this research are to develop such a vision based localization system, specifically in the context of mobile devices.  Aspects of feature detection in images, matching between viewpoints, and fusion into an automatically generated map will be addressed.  The research will focus on two aspects for mobile devices: processing power and devices, and compact scene map representations.  The former will look for theory and algorithms that can run on lower processing power devices such as mobile phones, or can be implemented in custom programmable devices or Graphic Processing Units (GPU).  Secondly, research will attempt to find compact representations of the map of vision features for efficient download to other robots or use by mobile users.  This compact data will allow location-based AR content viewable on consumer camera cell phones when a user enters an area previously mapped and aligned with virtual content by others.

"Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in North American men. Brachytherapy entails permanent

implantation of radioactive sources with needles into the prostate, under live ultrasound image guidance.

Brachytherapy is applied in ~55,000 cases annually in North America, with excellent survival rates and control

of cancer.

At the same time, radiation toxicity remains a very significant problem. Incorrect spatial calibration between

implant needles and the ultrasound image leads to faulty delivery of the radiation dose. This reduces the

efficacy of cancer control and directly contributes to negative side effects, such as rectal ulcers and

incontinence.

Calibration today is a laborious manual process, performed periodically, with the assumption that the

calibration remains valid over time. In reality, however, calibration parameters may change inadvertently

during storage, transportation and setup in the operating room. This is practically impossible to detect during

the procedure and thus the surgeon can never be certain whether the system functions correctly.

In contrast to contemporary practice, we propose to calibrate the brachytherapy system in the operating room.

Our method is fully automated and could be implemented in only a few minutes while the patient is being

prepared for surgery. Should this proposal be successful, we will demonstrate that our approach is significantly

more reliable and accurate while costing less than conventional calibration.

By increasing the accuracy of brachytherapy, our results will enhance the standard of care and quality of life

for millions of men suffering from prostate cancer.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"
"Image-guided percutaneous (through the skin) needle-based surgery has become standard practice and the number of these procedures can be measured by the millions in Canada. Contrary to casual observation, needle-based surgery can be an exceedingly complex intervention. Despite significant research in surgical navigation, the process and ergonomics of surgical assistance is little understood and formally not described. Medical trainees perform needle interventions under the supervision of a senior surgeon. This is a slow and inherently subjective process that lacks objective quantitative assessment of surgical skill and performance. Current evaluations schemes are rather simplistic and many important nuances that pertain to collateral morbidity, side effects, pain and patient discomfort are not captured in the current skill assessment models. This proposal will address these issues by uniting computational models, instrumentation and experimentation. The main contribution of the program will be a mathematical language for needle based surgery and formal analytical methodologies for performance analysis of both engineered systems and surgeons using these systems. At least eight graduate students will be trained with funding from this proposal. The work will also impact medical students and residents who will learn new surgical navigation methods.

"This research program applies an advanced genetic algorithm called ""Ferret"" to three large and very difficult data-modeling problems in astrophysics.  These topics are linked by significant scientific overlap and a fortuitous convergence of computational techniques that illustrate the power and potential of this approach.



Gravitational lensing is a prediction of general relativity, in which light rays from a distant galaxy or quasar are bent by the gravity of a massive foreground galaxy or galaxy cluster.  This natural lens magnifies the background object significantly but often breaks it into multiple images and distorted arcs.  A new technique based on Ferret determines the optimal mass distribution of the gravitational lens that is best able to re-assemble these shattered images into a single image of the source.  By applying this technique to a large archive of data, we will learn about the spatial distribution of dark matter in gravitational lens systems, while also obtaining images of the background sources from these natural telescopes.



Rotating disks of neutral hydrogen in nearby galaxies also allow us to probe the structure of dark matter in galaxies, since the rotational velocity of the gas is determined mainly by the gravitational field of the dark matter.  I propose to use a new code called GalAPAGOS, based on Ferret, to build mathematical models of these systems, thereby determining the distribution of dark matter and other properties of the gas.



Stars form in dense regions called ""cores"" within molecular clouds.  These clouds emit partially polarized submillimetre radiation from dust grains that are aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field, on average.  Ferret will be used to fit theoretical models of magnetized cores to data from a large survey of molecular clouds.  This will determine the role of these predicted field structures within the surrounding turbulence.

Molecular Biologists on problems with substantive statistical issues. In all cases it is important to have procedures which are

robust against model misspecification. In the area of animal tracking data, the approach is to model the data using nonlinear state space models in which the errors are typically non-normal. In related research, issues involved in assessing trends in ecological series will be addressed. Both bootstrap and saddlepoint methodology will be developed to provide reliable inference for the proposed models. A related issue is to have methodology for model selection with particular interest in the case where the true model does not lie within the model frame.



In molecular evolution, the focus will be on using the spectral envelope for sequences of amino acids with a view to classifying proteins as well as constructing phylogenetic trees.

"Biological processes in cells are intrinsically dynamic and this dynamicity can be affected by diseases and other factors.  At the protein level, the dynamicity is manifested by changes in the amount of specific proteins and in the modifications that these proteins carry.  Therefore, the ability to identify and monitor the level of proteins in the cell and the changes in their modification can greatly help our understanding of biological process and potentially provide new approaches for drug development.  Unfortunately, techniques that are capable of following the ensemble of proteins present in cells (the proteome) are currently not available.    In recent years, we and other groups have focused on breaking the proteome into parts called sub-proteomes.  We have demonstrated that by studying sub-proteomes, proteins never observed before can be analyzed and that simple mass spectrometry based techniques can be used.  We propose to develop a suite of stand-alone technologies, based on affinity purification and miniaturization that will allow the purification and processing of sub-proteomes. In particular, we will develop simple two and three dimensional miniaturized systems that combine microscale techniques to target specific sub-proteomes with microscale techniques and then process the proteins in that proteome.  These stand-alone systems will be compatible with simple mass spectrometry techniques readily available in many laboratories.  We propose to build systems for quantitating protein levels in sub-proteomes and to look at the changes in protein phosphorylations in these sub-proteomes.  We envision that over time we will have an array of these sub-proteome analytical systems that can be commercialized and used to provide a better model and increased understanding of biological processes resulting in new approaches for drug development.  This will be an important development for the field of proteomics because it will allow more proteins to be identified and quantified, and it will be readily adaptable in other research laboratories.  The development of novel technologies is of great importance to Canada, especially those that can be commercialized and can have direct application for better understanding human diseases.

"Historically, drinking water systems have supported human health and workforce productivity in Canada.  Many Canadian drinking water systems are reaching the end of their functional life and will have to be rehabilitated soon.  System upgrades and improvements made today may be inadequate to meet hydraulic and water quality requirements in the future due to changes in climate and urbanization patterns, and potential biological and/or chemical attacks.  A big challenge that municipal water utilities face is to rehabilitate their systems with only a limited knowledge of the likelihood and significance of the structural, hydraulic, and biological/chemical loadings on these systems in the future.  Thus, there is a need for decision-support models to help municipalities rehabilitate and manage their drinking water systems so that they are less vulnerable to future threats.

  In Theme A (Drinking Water Network Rehabilitation Under Uncertainty), quantitative risk assessment and multi-objective programming techniques will be developed and combined to rehabilitate drinking water distribution networks that are cost-effective and robust in an environment of loading uncertainty.  Currently, few network rehabilitation models consider the uncertainty of pipe-break and demand loads, and pipe aging in an integrated manner.  This research is important to municipal water utilities because it will help them protect the safety of their drinking water while avoiding expensive retrofits to meet unanticipated loads.  In Theme B (Random Water Demand in Drinking Water Networks), statistical analyses will be carried out to develop a model of random water demand in drinking water distribution networks.  This research is important because it will form the basis of decision-making tools that water utilities can use to rapidly plan and implement measures to minimize human exposure following contamination events and prevent further contamination.

"Flotation is one of the most widely used processes for recovering minerals from ores, providing the commodities of every day life from energy (oil sands) to consumer goods (nickel, copper) and advanced technologies (silicon). The process depends on dispersion of air as bubbles throughout tanks containing crushed and ground ore particles suspended in water (slurry). In the tank (or cell) hydrophobic minerals (not easily wetted) will attach to the bubbles and rise to form a froth (the float product or concentrate) and overflow the cell while the hydrophilic mineral particles remain in suspension to form the non-float product (or tailings). Two chemical reagent classes are commonly used in the separation, one to modify particle properties (e.g., collectors to convert hydrophilic particles to hydrophobic) and another to alter the bubble properties, known as frothers. It is this second reagent class that is a focus of this proposal. 

Frothers promote dispersion of air into small bubbles (< 2mm) and froth formation. The McGill Mineral Processing group has pioneered the development of a range of sensors to measure air dispersion properties, e.g., bubble size, in industrial plants. The technology has had a significant impact on both understanding the process and improving plant operation. It was evident in the work that frother type and concentration was a significant factor in bubble production. This proposal seeks to integrate our recent advances in frother technology, e.g., an analysis technique suited to site work, with the gas dispersion sensor technology. The combination promises the next level of breakthrough in managing effective use of air in flotation plants.

"Flotation is a particle separation process used to recover minerals. The process combines chemical and physical principles, an example being use of chemical reagents (frothers) to control bubble size and froth formation, i.e., physical (hydrodynamic) properties. The proposal explores this interaction through a series of topics. 

1. Gas holdup and frother. Gas holdup, the amount of gas in a system, is governed by the bubble size/velocity relationship which is influenced by frother. Individual frothers produce unique relationships, and we plan to determine the origin.

2. Gas hold-up and solids. Generally, adding solids reduces gas hold-up. The common explanation is promotion of bubble coalescence. There is evidence that bubble size does not always change and thus some other mechanism is at play. Using the unique set of instruments we have developed it is possible to track gas hold-up and bubble size simultaneously. We will establish the conditions giving a decrease in gas hold-up and explore the mechanisms.

3. Water recovery and frother. Water recovery, which controls recovery of unwanted minerals, is influenced by frother chemistry but the mechanism is obscure. Using a novel analysis method we can trace frother distribution (some adsorbs on bubbles, some remains in solution) which opens a route to study the action and relate to water transport.

"Conventionally, ecosystem attributes are considered either structural or functional.  Increasingly, however, ecologists are concerned with anthropogenic impacts on ecosystem functional attributes, in part  because of their (purported) strong relationship with ecological goods and services. This notwithstanding, most ecological monitoring/surveillance programs, ecological risk assessments and restoration initiatives employ structural or compositional endpoints and indicators.  Hence, evaluating risks to ecosystem functionality almost invariably require inferences from ecosystem structure to ecosystem function.  An obvious question is then: to what extent, and under what conditions, are such inferences justified?

    )	I propose to develop a predictive theory of the relationship between ecosystem structure and function using both synthetic (meta-analytic)  and primary (first order) approaches.  In the former,  I will (a) synthesize and integrate results from studies which have directly investigated relationships between ecosystem structure and ecosystem function; (b) based on (a), develop empirical models (fuzzy cognitive maps based on weight of evidence) relating ecosystem structure and function; and (c) investigate the extent to which these models can predict the effects of anthropogenic stressors on ecosystem system function, using a second database of published studies specifically concerned with stressor impacts on ecosystem structure and function.  In the latter, I will use whole-system manipulations to investigate the effects of introduced piscivores on the structural and functional attributes of small temperate lake ecosystems.  

    )	The proposed research will provide information on the conditions - if any - under which ecosystem function can be reliably predicted from ecosystem structure, a question of critical importance in the crafting of environmental legislation, policy and (especially) regulation; the design of environmental surveillance/monitoring programs; the assessment of ecosystem restoration success, and ecological risk assessment.

"One of the main questions challenging environmental scientists is to understand how increasing anthropogenic carbon dioxide concentrations will change climate. The ocean is one of the most important reservoirs of inorganic carbon, and its ability to act as a long-term sink for CO2 is affected by phytoplankton through the flux of photosynthetically fixed carbon from the surface into the deep ocean, termed the biological pump. The magnitude and efficiency of the biological pump are among the most important and least understood components in climate research.  The biological pump is affected by changes in the phytoplankton community structure, specifically size and taxonomic structure that change with evolutionary processes and respond to environmental conditions. This research program proposes to investigate the effect of climate change on phytoplankton community structure through the following projects: I) an evaluation of the macroevolutionary changes in the size structure of marine dinoflagellates (organic cysts) and diatoms (silica frustules) in response to climate change over the Cenozoic and part of the Mesozoic, II) testing for latitudinal gradients in the size structure of diatoms and dinoflagellate assemblages, and determining if these gradients have changed over geological time, III) determining how catastrophic biotic crises, such as occurred at the end-Cretaceous, affected the size structure of the phytoplankton and carbon cycling, IV) investigation of the role of nutrient concentration on the size structure of phytoplankton communities using a combination of laboratory experiments and ecophysiological models, V) assessment of the potential role of silicon availability in altering the morphostructure of diatom frustules and the associated implications for carbon cycling.  The goal of this research program is to elucidate how environmental change has altered phytoplankton communities and the biological pump over geological time to improve our ability to predict how current and future climate change may interact with phytoplankton community structure.

"Canada's natural environment is presently undergoing rapid change. Global warming and losses of biodiversity threaten the ecosystems that Canadians depend upon for economic prosperity, health and agriculture. Therefore, there is a need for a better understanding of the mechanisms through which ecosystems respond to climatic change. In order to gain this understanding, it is necessary to study ecosystems on long temporal and large spatial scales. Paleoclimatic records indicate that since the last ice age, significant climatic changes have occurred. The goal of the research program is to use the long-term perspective given by paleoecological science to quantify the responses of biological systems to climatic changes on long time scales; the findings supply case studies of these responses, and will aid in predicting the impacts of global warming and losses of biological diversity. Paleoecological science involves the study of lake or wetland sediment cores that contain detailed records of environmental change over thousands of years. The major technique used here is the analysis of the microscopic biological remains preserved in the sediments, including pollen grains and aquatic organisms such as diatoms. These indicators show how terrestrial vegetation and aquatic communities have changed over time and these records can be superimposed on paleoclimatic data to quantify the correlations between climatic and ecological changes. The research program will be focussed on Arctic Canada as this region is highly sensitive to climatic change. Field work will concentrate on sampling across gradients of biodiversity and biological productivity to determine how the properties of ecosystems modulate responses to climatic change. This strategy will enable the identification of the most sensitive types of Arctic ecosystems, and will also show how losses of biodiversity might exacerbate the impacts of climatic change.","Earth sciences","Environmental Earth Sciences"

"Deposition of inhaled aerosols in children is of increasing interest, partly due to advances in aerosol inhalation therapy for treating disease, but also due to increased awareness of the health effects of exposure to environmental aerosols in an increasingly urban population. In order to predict the efficacy of an inhaled pharmaceutical aerosol or to assess inhalation dosimetry of an environmental aerosol, it is necessary to first predict the amount of aerosol depositing in the extrathoracic region (consisting of the nose, or mouth, and throat). Unfortunately, little data is available in children to develop validated mathematical models for this purpose, largely because of a lack of data on which to base such models. To address this lack of knowledge, in the present application we propose to build physical replicas of pediatric extrathoracic airways and then measure monodisperse aerosol deposition in these bench-top replicas. Numerical simulation (computational fluid dynamics) will be used to supplement the experimental work. Similar experimental and computational work done by us in adults allowed development of dimensionless correlations that predict extrathoracic deposition in individual subjects with good accuracy. We propose to develop similar subject-specific correlations for children. The result of this work will be algebraic dimensionless equations that can be used to predict, a priori, extrathoracic doses to individual children. In addition to the above, we propose to develop idealized physical models of pediatric airways that can be used in bench-top testing for the development of pharmaceutical aerosols. Similar work by us in adults has resulted in an idealized mouth-throat geometry that is widely used by companies in device and formulation development. 



The proposed work will allow an in-depth understanding of aerosol mechanics in replicas of pediatric extrathoracic airways, thereby allowing improved assessment of ambient aerosol exposure in children, as well as the development of improved therapeutic aerosol drug delivery in pediatric patients.

"Single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are nanometer wide, single atom thick tubes of carbon that may be made centimeters long, or even longer. They are probably the best practical realization of idealized ""quantum wires"", which are wires so thin that quantum mechanics is needed to understand them. One prediction of their quantum behavior is that most nanotubes should function as excellent light emitters. Our group has discovered ways of synthesizing nanotube samples so that they really are efficient light emitters. We are developing ways to detect and photograph even single nanotubes, despite their minute dimensions. We can even observe these nanoscale structures as they are formed. We are using the ability to see these nanotubes directly to fabricate better and better nanotube samples. This project will improve the quality of nanotube samples, and lay a foundation for the fabrication of practical nanotube-based structures and devices, concentrating on optoelectronics, a traditional area of strength for Canada.



Funding for this proposal will go entirely to pay student salaries and for their conference attendance. Using state-of-the-art equipment and methods, students will perform research in nanotube synthesis, nanofabrication, optical imaging, optical spectroscopy, and nano-electronics.","Materials sciences","Condensed Matter Physics"

"Software testing and debugging take up between 30 and 50% of the development cost in embedded systems. Despite this large percentage and the associated enormous costs, only little attention has been devoted to debugging of embedded real-time systems. Ad-hoc methods such as blinking lights to indicate errors and morsing error codes via beepers still dominate microcontroller-based system development.

The proposed project will research methods and tools that provide a well-structured approach that assists the developer with tools and analysis methods during the debugging process. We will specifically study the following problems: detecting probe effects (changes in defect behavior because of program instrumentation), estimating system perturbation (changes in program behavior because of instrumentation), and interactive debugging. Other problems such as test generation, coverage, and program verification are outside the scope of this project.

We will use program analysis, profiling, and developer specifications to create a holistic resource-consumption model of a given program. This model will allow us to implant debugging code at location which cause low system perturbation and possibly no probe effects. Using program transformation, we will change the program to increase the number and quality of suitable locations. Automata-based interfaces for peripherals will allow us to create interactive debugging of devices with physical sensor and actuators. The success will be measured by comparing the quality of our automatic instrumentation of example programs with instrumentation done by expert developers.

The results of this programme will decrease the product development cost of embedded software. Canadian companies can use these savings to improve the software quality or add more features. Furthermore, reduced development costs lower the barrier of entry for start ups and will create additional jobs around growing industries such as automotive, medical devices, avionics, and consumer electronics.

"Cells in the body communicate with one another by releasing chemicals that can excite or inhibit other cells.  This communication can be very fast, as with the release of neurotransmitters from neurons in the brain, or it can be relatively slow, as with the release of hormones from neuroendocrine cells into the blood stream.  Both types of release depend on the influx of calcium ions through pores or ""channels"" in the cell membrane.  The function of calcium channels is therefore critical for intercellular communication. Specific mechanisms have evolved to send calcium channels to specific locations to perform their functions.  We have found a new variant of a calcium channel in two types of neuroendocrine cells.  This difference in channel structure may help to explain why release of neurotransmitters from neurons is fast, while release of neurohormones from neuroendocrine cells is relatively slow.  We propose to do experiments to determine whether this calcium channel variant is found in other types of neuroendocrine cells and whether it is also found in neurons.  We also propose to try to determine how this difference in structure changes the way the calcium channel variant works with the machinery that causes the release of chemical messengers.  Our proposed experiments will therefore help us to understand the mechanisms by which cells release neurotransmitters and hormones.

"Food webs define the pathways and movement of energy, nutrients and contaminant within a biological community or ecosystem, or more simply, a trophic hierarchy of feeders and fed upon. All organisms are embedded within food webs, and the amounts of energy, nutrients and contaminants it receives are critical for survival. Many of the world's ecosystems are heavily influenced by man's actions and efforts to manage resources, which can ultimately change the types and amounts of organisms that can survive in an ecosystem. Unfortunately, food webs are notoriously difficult to study. The conventional method is to examine stomach contents, which has a number of drawbacks (e.g., contents are digested at different rates) and is often difficult (e.g., very small stomach size). Recently, chemical tracers, such as stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon and fatty acids, have been used to provide a descriptive method for establishing food web structure. Although these tracers have improved our study of food webs there is still a need to calibrate and verify them under controlled laboratory and field studies under varying environmental conditions. My research will calibrate a wide suite of established and novel chemical tracers in laboratory and field studies under salinity and temperature gradients. Changes to salinity and temperature in aquatic systems are forecasted to be major consequences of climate change. Calibrations of chemical tracers are imperative if characterization of food webs and the impact of anthropogenic stress are to be proper understood. Understanding how food webs function is essential for proper conservation and management and ultimately healthy and sustainable ecosystems.

"Investigating the genetic basis of complex traits like longevity, disease resistance, and behaviour is challenging since they are influenced by numerous genes and by fluctuations in the environment. The lability and complexity of behaviours like foraging are ideal for investigating the evolutionary genetics of complex traits. Foraging in larval fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, is largely influenced by natural allelic variation in the foraging gene (for). These alleles confer a natural behaviour polymorphism where rovers (forR) and sitters (fors) differ in their movement rates between and within food patches. New preliminary evidence suggests that foraging behaviour is also influenced by natural allelic variation in a modifier gene wings up A (wupA). wupA decreases rover foraging behaviour to a sitter level. In mammals the cGMP-dependent protein kinase, encoded by for, phosphorylates the Troponin-I (TnI) protein encoded by wupA. TnI is an important regulator of muscle contraction and is likely involved in the muscle output of food search behaviours. I propose to further investigate the role of epistatic interactions between wupA and for by first confirming a behavioural role for wupA using quantitative trait locus mapping and complementation tests with mutants in both wupA and for. I will measure the relative behavioural implications of natural allelic variation in for and wupA by introgressing alleles of wupA and for. Given that previous analyses have shown a role for negative frequency-dependent selection in maintaining allelic variation in for, I will investigate whether variation in wupA plays a role in the maintenance rovers and sitters. Finally, I propose to begin assessing the population genetics and molecular evolution of alleles in for/wupA by looking for signatures of positive selection in alignments of for and wupA from the genome sequences of 12 Drosophila species. I will then extend these analyses to a series of inbred lines that were recently derived from a natural population. Understanding the dynamic epistatic interactions between for and wupA on foraging behaviour provides a unique avenue and model system for studying complex trait evolution.

"Computer graphics is among the most pervasive of all information technologies.  Progress in the area of realistic computer graphics has been at once fast and sluggish.  Certainly the interactive depiction of some realistic phenomena is becoming increasingly feasible.  Yet despite remarkable strides forward, the convincing depiction of realistic environments involving even moderately complex geometry, materials and lights, and physical or biological simulation, is a slow offline process in which the validity of the outcome is unclear.  Paradoxically, the ease with which our eyes can be convinced makes it all the more difficult to see that computer graphics has little basis in reality.



Computer graphics is now blending with results from other fields.  What assurances can we give users of our visual simulations as they integrate them with real-world data from medicine, science and art?  How can we guarantee our images are accurate?  How can we reason about fast approximations, the assumptions they take, and the errors they incur?  How can we deal with ever increasing visual complexity?



Being clear about what we are doing requires more precise mathematical characterization.  My research programme for the next few years will focus on putting computer graphics on a sounder mathematical footing, and then applying the results to develop fast, reliable, accurate algorithms for illlumination and animation.  The first step will be to reformulate the fundamental equations of light transport to allow multiple geometric representations with embedded physical dynamics.  The next step will be to demonstrate how this more precise view of realistic computer graphics will lead to more efficient and accurate algorithms suitable for embedding in next-generation graphics systems.  We will see that a crucial component is the development of techniques in realistic computer graphics that are sensitive to the scale of the input and the output.

"Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins regulate cellular responses that contribute to numerous processes, both normal and pathologic, in humans and other organisms, such as fruit flies. STAT proteins function by altering the expression of specific genes in order to modify the profile of proteins that a cell expresses. STAT proteins do this by binding to DNA in the nucleus. Prior to activation, the STAT proteins are present in an inactive state in the cytoplasm of a cell. They are activated when their unique receptors are stimulated at the plasma membrane of the cell. Once activated, STAT proteins go to the nucleus in order to bind to DNA and modulate gene expression.  While it was thought originally that activated STAT proteins remained in the nucleus for the duration of their activity, increasing evidence indicates that they actually stay in the nucleus only a very short time. We now know that during the course of receptor activation, STAT proteins undergo multiple rounds of activation at the plasma membrane and inactivation in the nucleus. This cycling in and out of the nucleus is thought to allow STAT proteins to translate receptor activation events at the plasma membrane into appropriate gene expression responses in the nucleus. We are investigating the mechanism by which this nucleocytoplasmic shuttling regulates the ability of a STAT family member (called STAT-6) to induce expression of genes in the nucleus. Our studies will benefit from a unique tool that we have developed to inhibit STAT-6.  This is a small protein, called a peptide, which can enter cells, and bind to and inhibit STAT-6. Our preliminary data suggest that this inhibitor effectively ""traps"" activated STAT-6, preventing it from cycling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Thus, we will use the STAT-6 inhibitory peptide in our experiments to understand how nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of STAT-6 regulates its ability to induce expression of target genes. Our experiments will also increase our understanding of the basic mechanisms by which this family of transcription factors regulates gene expression and may ultimately lead to a better understanding of how these proteins function in both normal and pathologic cellular responses.","Advancement of knowledge","Cell Biology"

"Our research group focuses at defining the molecular mechanisms implicated in the regulation of the cPLA2alpha, a key protein involved in the formation of several bioactive lipids. More precisely, the cPLA2alpha releases important components of cell membranes that are further transformed into potent bioactive lipids. Too much of these lipids worsens inflammatory diseases like arthritis and asthma. Therefore, understanding how our body generates these lipids is very important in order to prevent their bad effect. In this proposal, we aim at understanding the mechanisms by which cyclic AMP prevents the activation of the cPLA2alpha in activated cells. Our experimental approach will allow us to decipher all the steps implicated in this effect of cyclic AMP both in vitro and in human cells. This work will not only provide key notions about how the activity of the cPLA2alpha is controlled in our body. It will also serve to train undergraduate and graduate students to become highly qualified scientists.

"Skilled object manipulation requires the ability to predict the weights of objects being acted upon. Such prediction enables the motor system to specify appropriate motor commands in advance, allowing smooth and dexterous control of fingertip forces. Weight perception also involves predictions about object weight. It is now well established that people judge the weight of an object relative to its expected or predicted weight. Such predictions enable us to make comparative judgments about weight and to communicate this information to others. Thus, weight prediction is important both when manipulating objects and when judging their weights. 

     The aim of the proposed research is to understand the basis of weight prediction in both action and perception. My students and I will test the hypothesis that the perceptual system learns maps relating object size to object weight for specific families of objects and then uses these maps to estimate object weight based on size cues. We will also test the hypothesis that the motor system learns maps for specific sets of objects, rather than entire families of objects. In a series of experiments, we will examine how these maps are acquired, how they are modified by experience, and how they generalize to new objects and contexts. The proposed work will involve measuring fingertip force applied to objects and recording perceptual estimates about object weight. Much of the proposed work will involve a novel robot device we have constructed that enables us to alter the weights of objects.

     The results of this research will provide fundamental information about the function of the motor and perceptual systems in object manipulation. This information can be used in a range of applied areas including human-machine interface design, teleoperator control, and rehabilitation therapy.

"Human activities are altering the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide with consequences such as warmer air temperatures and altered precipitation and snow melt patterns. I propose to initiate a series of new lab and field studies to investigate the acclimation and adaptation of northern conifer trees and whole ecosystem response to altered environmental conditions. Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) trees dominate the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in southern Alberta at the sharp transition zone between grassland and forest ecosystems. This is an ideal area and set of species to use in studies of tree and ecosystem physiology because this transition zone should be very susceptible to anticipated climate changes, including warmer temperatures and shifts in the availability of water sources (altered snow melt patterns, change in spring/summer precipitation). My planned studies will investigate the response of photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration and water-use efficiency to increases in temperature and the physiological mechanisms controlling the observed responses. We will study the linkages between the efficiency of water transport through tree stems and tree sensitivity to high temperature-induced declines in photosynthesis and growth. Stable isotope tracers will be used to measure variation in the uptake and use of snow melt water and spring/summer precipitation by trees. Our measurements will be compared to predictions of physiological models to gain further understanding of the mechanistic controls and the reasons for potential differences in sensitivity between species in their response to environmental changes. Finally, our measurements will be used to initialize and test a detailed ecosystem model under current conditions, so that the model can be used to predict tree and ecosystem physiological responses under proposed scenarios of future climate change.",Environment,"Plant Biology & Food Science"

"This proposal focuses on the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the 

regulation of maternal attention and nurturing behavior in the mother rat. 

Three psychobiological systems are intrinsic to the regulation of maternal 

behavior. These systems mediate: 1) Maternal experience and memory; 2); 

Hedonics and reward; and, 3) Affect. Here we address the mechanism of a 

fourth system, the PFC that regulates Attention and its role in mothering. 

Our hypothesis is that the brain dopamine (DA) neurotransmitter system acts 

as a unifying mechanism that ties the functions of the different neural 

systems together. The first studies will determine the relationship between 

ongoing maternal behavior in a semi-natural social and physical environment 

in groups sustaining lesions of the mPFC and sham controls. The second set 

of studies will test the hypothesis that manipulations of the dopamine 

system within the medial prefrontal cortex and the subcortical nucleus 

accumbens system (through the use of DA receptor agonists and antagonists) 

will produce different effects on mothering and associated behaviors 

depending on site in brain of the infusion. In the third group of studies, 

we will use microdialysis to measure extracellular DA release in the mPFC 

and nucleus accumbens during ongoing maternal behavior and during tests of 

maternal attention and reward. The relevance of these animal studies may be 

found in recent fMRI findings that indicate the importance of these brain sites for human mothering.

"Lead and arsenic are toxic elements which are encountered in daily life. Serious health effects may result from chronic exposure to even moderate levels of these elements. The objectives of the proposed research relate to the development of novel x-ray fluorescence (XRF) techniques to detect lead and arsenic, and to uncover how these elements distribute in the body. Specifically, the objectives include the use of XRF in the following interrelated themes of research: (1) the development of a transformative new miniature x-ray tube XRF approach to assess exposure to trace elements at environmental levels; (2) the use of a new synchrotron radiation microprobe to discover the nature of arsenic in human skin; and (3) the use of the highest precision bone lead system in the world to better understand the critical issue of lead kinetics. 

    A miniature x-ray tube approach, applied for the first time to arsenic measurement in skin models or ""phantoms"", has provided a significant step forward over any previous method. Method improvements are proposed, along with careful dosimetry, and experimentation into the novel detection of selenium, lead, and possibly other trace elements of interest.

    There is currently no detailed understanding of how arsenic distributes in human skin. This is of interest as both a fundamental research question and as a necessary component for the eventual application of the miniature x-ray tube techniques we are developing. A new microprobe technique at the Canadian Light Source will be used to reveal this distribution. 

    The kinetics of lead in the human body is only partially understood. Since the vast majority of lead in the body resides in bone tissue, bone lead measurement is key to solving this puzzle. Major occupational and environmental lead exposure surveys will be undertaken using the world's most sensitive bone lead XRF system, and results used to develop better computer models of lead kinetics.

"Aquaculture has become an important industry and employer in coastal areas of rural Canada, with production dominated by Atlantic salmon. The industry, however, faces challenges related to escaping fish, which continue to persist despite mitigation measures to reduce their incidence. Moreover, global competition and poor public perception have created an intense market for salmonids. To remain competitive, the industry is diversifying, and marine species such as Atlantic cod are being studied as candidates for domestication. Interest has been spurred on by the collapse of wild cod stocks, and commercial production in likely in the near future. Based on experiences with salmon, we can expect farmed cod to escape and interact with wild cod. The extent and consequences of these interactions, however, are unknown for such a strictly marine species. Now is the time to address this issue before industry practices become standard, and before mitigation becomes difficult and costly to implement. Our project will determine the nature of the interactions between farmed and wild cod and from this, provide a means to assess risk and identify mitigation measures. Our research encompasses five areas: (1) Determination of the likelihood of inbred cod reproducing within cages, and the subsequent quality of embryos released into the environment. (2) Determination of factors which may reduce the motivation of cod to escape from cages. (3) Tagging studies to determine the fate of escaped fish and whether they can be easily recaptured. (4) Mating experiments to determine the potential for

interbreeding between farmed and native wild cod, and thus the potential for the introduction of aquaculture/non-native traits into the wild where they are likely to have a negative impact. (5) Laboratory experiments to determine if hybrids potentially produced from native cod and escaped fish from a different population will have lower growth and survival than native fish. The results of our project aim to reduce potential ecological effects, as well as indsutry costs, of escapes from aquaculture and improve Canada's ability to respond to the science and policy challenges presented by the growth of its aquaculture industry.","Environmental impact of economic activities (including agriculture)","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Food and Bioproducts"

With the increased role of electronic commerce in today's society, intelligent computer systems (agents) are being called upon to make decisions on a user's behalf in electronic markets where goods, services and information are purchased, sold and traded. Such decision making requires detailed knowledge of the user's preferences; therefore, efficient and accurate methods for learning about the user's preferences and for reasoning with incomplete information are critical components of this work.  In the case of settings where an agent is negotiating with or competing against other agents (acting on the behalf of other users), additional concerns include the design of effective negotiation strategies and the ability to model the opponent's preferences and goals.



The overall goal of this research program is to develop improved techniques for intelligent agents to use in making decisions on behalf of users in electronic markets.  Particular emphasis is placed on the need for such agents to adapt their behaviour to the preferences and goals of each individual user.  It is anticipated that at least 3 graduate students per year will be involved in this research program and the work is expected to make contributions to research in the areas of electronic commerce, preference elicitation, decision-theoretic reasoning, user modeling and automated negotiation.

"The Bruker D8 Discover micro X-ray diffractometer (CFI 2001) in Earth Sciences at Western was the first of its kind in an Ontario University.  Its accessibility makes it unique in Canada. Micro X-ray diffraction (�XRD) enables in situ characterization of individual phases in heterogeneous materials on a grain-by-grain basis (50-500 �m beam), to obtain crystal structural information from solid materials in situ, regardless of size, shape, or complexity of the sample. This instrument has application for materials characterization in Earth Sciences, Chemistry, Planetary Science, Materials Science and Engineering. It is still productive, however, it is badly in need of maintenance and upgrades or it will cease to operate. The X-ray tube and Gobel mirror parallel optics system are in critical need of replacement, and the detector requires a 'regas'. NSERC RTI funds are requested to 1) replace the existing, aging Cu source with a Co source, to enable collection of high quality data for iron-rich samples, and 2) replace the existing, corroded 40 mm Gobel mirror with a sealed 60 mm Gobel mirror configured for Co, 3) upgrade the software and add an additional license, 4) regas the GADDS area detector.  Co radiation will improve the quality of data collected for iron-containing samples, which is important for projects herein and for examination of many natural and synthetic materials. Continued operation of the �XRD is critical to Flemming's research and impacts several other groups at Western.  Flemming's ongoing projects include in situ study of meteorite mineralogy and shock state, to determine their origin and history, and investigation of kimberlite indicator minerals, for potential use in diamond exploration. Co-applicants are utilizing the in situ capabilities of the �XRD to study mineralogical evidence for ancient microbial inhabitation of rocks (Banerjee), the role of microbes in ore formation (Southam), macroscopic preservation of fossils (Tsujita), and shock state of impacted Earth materials at Haughton crater (Devon Island, NU) (Osinski). Technological materials under investigation include nanowires for fuel cell technology (Sun) and corrosion products affecting nuclear waste storage (Shoesmith and Wren).

"This research investigates the relationship between impulsivity, sensitivity to rewarding stimuli, and the effects of drugs of abuse in adolescence versus adulthood. The work is based on the that adolescence is characterised by a poorly developed inhibitory control mechanisms, coupled to an overactive ""motivational"" system. This model predicts that adolescent animals will be more impulsive than adults, while showing enhanced reactivity to rewarding stimuli. We hypothesise that these behavioural differences will be accompanied by age-dependent alterations in neural activity in cortical areas related to inhibitory control, and in subcortical areas related to motivation and reward-seeking. The work will explore four questions. Question 1 is whether adolescent rats show poor inhibitory control compared to adults. This will be done using three behavioural tests that measure different types of impulsive behaviour, including motor impulsivity and a form of cognitive impulsivity where subjects choose a small reward available immediately over a bigger reward available at a later time. Question 2 asks whether adolescent rats are more sensitive than adults to rewarding stimuli. We will examine whether sucrose preference, and the way that animals learn about conditioned reinforcers, differ between the age-groups. The third question is whether age-dependent differences in impulsivity or reward sensitivity involve differential activation of frontal cortex or limbic regions respectively. Both in situ hybridization and in vivo microdialysis will be used to measure the expression of the immediate early gene zif268, and extracellular levels of dopamine. Finally, the question of whether adolescent impulsivity predicts subsequent drug abuse will be examined. Rats will be characterised during adolescence as high or low impulsive subjects. Their propensity to develop drug self-administration, or to relapse after a period of abstinence will be examined. This program of research will fill a current gap in our knowledge about whether adolescents have poor inhibitory control and/or enhanced reward sensitivity in comparison to adults. The work will determine whether age-dependent differences in these behaviours lead to an increased vulnerability to develop maladaptive addictive behaviours.",Psychology,"Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences"

"Soil salinity is a major factor in reducing plant growth and productivity. Most crop plants are highly sensitive to salt stress that tends to cause a water deficit due to osmotic stress, and that causes several biochemical problems due to toxic excess intracellular sodium. The degree of salt tolerance of some plant species varies greatly. Sodium/Hydrogen (Na+/H+) antiporters are membrane proteins that remove salt from inside the cells of plants and yeast. Overexpression of Na+/H+ antiporters has been shown to confer improved salt tolerance in plants allowing them to grow in saltier soils. The purpose of our project is to understand how Na+/H+ antiporters work, that is, to better understand the way that they remove salt out of cells. To do this we are using a model system of yeast to study how Na+/H+ antiporters function. Yeast have Na+/H+ antiporters that are very similar to plant Na+/H+ antiporters. They are related in protein sequence and can replace each other and function normally. There are several parts to the project. In one part we are learning which regions of the protein are important in activity. We use a yeast that has its Na+/H+ antiporter deleted and return the Na+/H+ antiporter into the yeast after we make mutations in the protein. Then we study how the protein functions. In another part of the study we are producing the protein and will examine the protein structure using nuclear magnetic resonance and electron microscopy. This will give us a picture of the protein. Additionally, we will use a technique whereby we can label the Na+/H+ antiporter protein with specific tags. These allow us to identify the location of the tags on the protein and give us an idea of the topology (or structure) of the protein. Overall, the project will help us understand how the protein works, allowing us to better design proteins that can be used to improve salt tolerance in plants.

"The dopamine systems of the brain are involved in cognition, motor activity, motivation and reward. These systems and their connections are remarkably plastic, undergoing changes throughout life. Repeated exposure to stimulant drugs, such as amphetamine, results in changes in dopamine systems resulting in long-lasting increases in sensitivity to the effects that these drugs, and to other life events that activate the dopamine systems. The general aim of my research project is to identify mechanisms that bring about changes in sensitivity in dopamine function and behavior, rendering individuals more (or less) vulnerable to subsequent exposure to drugs or to stressors. Too this end I will study how amphetamine induces such changes in the adult brain. Identification of these processes will have important implications for our understanding of how 'experience' can alter dopamine circuitry and, in turn, dopamine-mediated behaviors. The enduring nature of changes in the dopamine system in the adult brain suggests reorganization of the circuitry by re-activation of factors that are normally involved in organizing neuronal wiring during development. Netrin-1 is a protein that plays a fundamental role in the organization of neuronal connectivity during development and we have recently shown that netrin-1 receptors are highly expressed by dopamine neurons in the adult brain and that their expression is regulated by repeated exposure to amphetamine. This research proposal is now aimed at identifying the precise role that the changes in netrin-1 receptor function observed play in dopamine plasticity and in how netrin-1 participates in dopamine plasticity.","Medical and health sciences","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences"
"The ability to use information flexibly and execute appropriate adaptive behaviours in response to changing environmental conditions is essential for survival in all species, and our previous work has shown the brain chemical dopamine plays a crucial role in these processes. Disruptions in dopamine signaling with certain drugs impedes different forms of cognitive flexibility, including shifting between different behavioural strategies and decision making about different choices associated with different risks and rewards.  The contribution of dopamine to these processes is thought to be mediated in part by brief, ""phasic"" increases and decreases in the activity of midbrain dopamine neurons that signal rewarded and non-rewarded events. However, the specific role that phasic dopamine activity plays in these forms of behavioural flexibility cannot be ascertained with standard pharmacological approaches. To address this issue directly, the present proposal is requesting specialized behavioural testing equipment that will enable us to deliver discrete bursts of electrical stimulation to dopamine neurons or inhibitory inputs to this region, to mimic the way these neurons behave when animals receive reward, or do not receive an expected reward. In essence, we hope that by activating or inhibiting dopamine neurons in a temporally specific manner we can mimic these phasic events to ascertain their control over behaviour, essentially tricking the brain into encoding a rewarded or non-rewarded events, leading to alterations in behaviour. The requested equipment is essential for us to employ this approach, enabling us to provide the first direct experimental data regarding the function of phasic dopamine signaling. This information will provide crucial insight into how a fundamental form of dopamine communication contributes to different aspects of reward-related learning and modification of learned behaviours in response to changes in reward contingencies.",Psychology,"Biological Systems and Functions"
"The ability to use information flexibly and execute appropriate adaptive behaviours in response to changing environmental conditions is essential for survival in all species. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is one region that is critical in facilitating cognitive flexibility by inhibiting the execution of a previous strategy to permit the emergence of new behaviours.  However, important questions remain regarding the cellular and neurochemical mechanisms that underlie the interplay between these circuits in the mediation of this type of executive functioning.  This research is designed to further clarify how the brain solves these types of problems in rodents, using a multidisciplinary approach.  We will investigate how dopamine, a brain chemical important for movement, reward and cognition, acts in a region termed the ventral striatum, to facilitate changes in behaviour. Other experiments will use novel molecular techniques to identify what role changes in the strengths of synapses play in adjusting behaviour to changes in one's environment.  In another aim, we will record neural activity from awake, behaving animals performing tasks that require them to behave in a flexible manner.  This will enable us to identify the specific codes that neurons in regions such as the PFC use to signal that the environment has changed and that the animal's behaviour must change with it. The present research proposal will provide valuable insight into the mechanisms by which the PFC and related subcortical nuclei interact to regulate strategy selection and cognitive flexibility.  These studies will ultimately will lead to a greater understanding of how distributed neural networks in the mammalian brain regulate an animal's ability to deal with changes in its environment and adapt its behaviour accordingly to promote its survival. Furthermore, in light of the fact that a number of mental disorders are associated with impairments in cognitive flexibility, the results of these studies may offer important insight into the neural dysfunction that underlies these conditions.

  Noncommutative dynamics have provided mathematicians and physicists with a natural framework in which quantum analogues of classical theories can be developed. It is the noncommutativity of operator algebras that lies at the heart of this framework.



  My research program will investigate the structure of certain time-irreversible noncommutative dynamics acting on operator algebras. These dynamics establish profound correlations between the anisotropy of physical time and the quantum behavior of physical objects. A complete mathematical understanding of their structure will enhance our knowledge of the quantum world by explaining the time-evolution of different quantum systems.

"The project is focused on the development of strategies for flow manipulation/control/re-arrangements using distributed forcing. The term ""distributed forcing"" denotes here various methods of producing weak forces at the solid/fluid interface; this is opposite to the concentrated and/or strong forcing applied locally. Methods of generating distributed forcing may rely on the use of surface roughness, micro-electro-mechanical devices (MEMS), wall transpiration, ionic wind effect, heating, etc., and can be applied to laminar, transitional and turbulent flows. Weak distributed forcing is of interest because its creation is associated with lower weight and smaller pressure loss penalty as compared with that required by a strong forcing. While strong forcing is always expected to produce large changes in the flow, a weak forcing may be effective only if it has correct spatial/temporal distribution. It is expected that weak forcing may create changes in the flow of the order of the characteristic scale of its pattern rather than just of the order of its magnitude. This strategy, in order to be effective, must take advantage of various flow instabilities, which re-distribute in a natural way the total flow energy among different modes. Only a small external energy input will be required in order to initiate the re-arrangement process if the control/re-arrangement strategy is properly designed. Preliminary results show that responses of flow systems show generic similarities regardless of the physical mechanisms used to generate forcing as long as the spatial distribution of forcing is similar; this fact underlines the robustness of the proposed approach and its wide range of applicability. Applications to be explored in this project include design of micro-mixers for fuel cells, micro-heat exchangers, laminar airfoils, surface textures that could lead to lower drag, techniques for manipulation of large structures in turbulent flows, propulsive devices relying on surface vibrations and asthma diagnosis procedures, among many others.",Aerospace,"Mechanical Engineering - B"

"Tissue engineering holds great promise for the treatment of many diseases, disorders, and traumas. The long-term objective is to create tissue substitutes that will fully integrate into the body, promoting regeneration and restoring lost function. One common approach is to seed a supporting scaffold with cells that will contribute to the developing tissues. The specific properties of the scaffold will vary depending on the required application. If possible, the patient's own cells should be used to avoid problems with immune rejection. Initially, the construct should define and maintain a desired three-dimensional shape, but ideally, the scaffold would degrade as it is replaced by the patient's own healthy tissues. Our aim is to develop a tissue-engineered fat substitute for reconstructive purposes.  The loss of the fat layer found below the skin results in scar tissue formation and deformity. There are numerous limitations to the existing treatment strategies for soft tissue augmentation, which primarily involve either synthetic implants or transferring tissues from other sites of the body. A tissue-engineered substitute could be used for many applications, including the reconstruction of breast tissue following surgery to remove cancer, the repair of birth defects, or for the treatment of traumatic injuries. Towards the goal of creating such a construct, my students and I are studying the adult stem cell population that is found within fat. Most patients have sufficient fat to donate a small sample for cell isolation. The adipose-derived stem cells can be grown in the lab and can become mature fat cells. We are developing a system to grow these precursor cells, while maximizing their ability to form new fat, so that sufficient cell numbers can be obtained for clinical applications. The cells will be grown on beads fabricated from collagen and other proteins that are found in the body. These scaffolds may promote normal cellular organization and behaviour, and can be degraded after implantation. Extensive testing will be conducted to characterize the constructs and optimize the growth conditions.  The cell-seeded beads will ultimately be incorporated in larger scaffolds to create natural substitutes for the reconstruction of large volume soft tissue defects.

"No comprehensive national strategy for greenhouse gas reduction can ignore the energy consumed in the ventilation and climate control of buildings. To this end, many ideas have been suggested for harnessing natural elements (e.g. solar radiation, wind forcing) for application in low-energy design. Unfortunately, technical barriers to the optimal exploitation of these freely-available resources persist, particularly in climates (such as Canada's) that exhibit strong seasonal variations. The objective of the present research is to address three related areas for which targeted study holds the promise of significantly expanding present understanding.

PASSIVE COOLING IN MULTI-STORY BUILDINGS: Internal stack pressures often provide sufficient motive force for summertime waste heat disposal. Whereas over- or under-ventilation of particular regions is to be avoided, however, this is difficult to achieve for interiors that are heavily-partitioned. Models based on plume theory, validated by similitude experiment, will be applied in identifying necessary design tradeoffs required for appropriate balancing under a variety of climatic conditions.

PASSIVE HEAT STORAGE WITH THERMAL MASS ELEMENTS: Heat-absorbing materials within the building fabric phase lag daytime solar gains so that heat is released during evening hours. In this context, the impact of internal thermal gains, particularly important for auditoriums, which are heavily occupied over sporadic periods, are typically ignored. We aim to rectify this deficiency of earlier models by performing detailed calculations that incorporate internal and external influences via radiative and convective forcing.

ACTIVE HEAT STORAGE WITH HOT WATER RESERVOIRS: When solar radiation is instead used to heat water rather than a solid thermal mass, thermodynamic efficiencies increase with the degree of temperature stratification within thermal reservoir(s). By adapting a numerical algorithm tailored to the study of turbulent convection, conditions likely to erode this temperature gradient, and thereby compromise system efficacy, shall be identified. Results will be validated using similitude experiments.

"A major goal of our research is the design of robust, selective catalysts that promote the formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Olefin metathesis is one of the most powerful tools now in use for this purpose, as noted in the citation awarding the 2005 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Schrock, Grubbs, and Chauvin. While the high, tunable selectivity of the Schrock catalysts is a major asset in achieving the synthesis of desired organic compounds, their high sensitivity to air and water is problematic. The Grubbs catalysts, based on the less oxophilic transition metal ruthenium, are much more easily handled, and have greatly expanded the uptake of olefin metathesis in organic synthesis. Despite this robustness, however, they are short-lived. They are also limited in terms of the ease of tuning activity and selectivity. Studying their deactivation pathways led us to develop a new family of catalyst that is longer-lived and more productive. It also offers expanded potential to define the active site at the catalyst, and thus selectivity. Combining robustness with selectivity would unite the two main streams of experimental development in olefin metathesis.

  A second major theme centers on ways to couple different catalytic processes. At present, organic molecules that are subjected to sequential catalytic transformations are typically isolated following one reaction, prior to applying the second. This incurs significant costs in terms of solvents, chemicals, and time. However, the structures of catalysts used for different types of transformations are sometimes strongly conserved. That is, we may need to change only the group bound to the metal that constitutes the active site, in order to transform the mode of catalytic activity. In other cases, we may need to change peripheral groups as well. In either case, if we can selectively modify the catalyst after one type of catalytic transformation is complete, we can ""turn on"" the second mode of reaction, and carry out coupled transformations without workup. Essential to control is an understanding of the underlying inorganic chemistry. Our studies focus on developing such understanding, and using it to design enabling tandem catalytic processes.

"One of the biggest challenges in gene therapy -- inserting genes into an individual's cells and tissues to treat a disease -- is successfully delivering DNA into cells, followed by the DNA being expressed. In our search for suitable materials to package DNA, we have identified a group of compounds known as gemini surfactants that can condense, protect and transport DNA into cells. Using these electrically charged compounds, we have developed a non-viral nanoparticle-based technology to deliver genes through the skin. Non-viral delivery systems have significant advantages relative to viral systems, as they are safer, cheaper and easier to prepare. Their major disadvantage, however, is that they are not as efficient, a deficiency this proposed research will address.



In the past three years we have made significant progress in developing gemini surfactant-based nanoparticles for gene delivery. We have used gemini nanoparticles to deliver specific genes through the skin in mice that have been bred for studies on scleroderma (a skin condition characterized by excess synthesis and deposition of collagen) and have seen a therapeutic response, which has demonstrated the feasibility of using this technology to treat genetically based skin conditions in humans.



This proposed research will expand our investigation of gemini surfactants as gene delivery biomaterials. We will study the physical and chemical properties of these compounds using a variety of techniques. Based on these characterization studies, we will design novel derivatives of gemini compounds with specific characteristics for improved transport through cellular and nuclear membranes, movement within the cell and ability to target the nucleus.

"Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an area of enormous importance in the petrochemical industries.  Its development has been driven by the need to minimize energy use and costs associated with the manufacture of off-specification product.  Much of its commercial success is due to its ability to move a plant to the most profitable operating point without violating process constraints.  The optimal control moves are implemented by adjusting the setpoints of Proportional Integral Derivative - or PID - strategies residing in the computer control system.  It is therefore vital to the success of  the MPC application that the underlying 

PID controllers be well-tuned and structured in such a way that interaction with other loops is minimized.

   With few exceptions, previous work in the area of controller assessment has been focused upon regulatory performance; that is, deviation of the controlled variable from its target value.  However, it is well-recognized by industrial practitioners that to properly gauge the fitness of a control strategy, one must also consider control effort and robustness, as well as servo performance (if close setpoint-following is required).  Large control effort is undesirable because it causes undue wear and tear on the control valve; a controller must be robust in order that its performance will not significantly degrade if operating conditions change.  The main objective of the proposed research program is to develop practical techniques for comparing the performance, control effort and robustness of industrial MPC and PID controllers against appropriate benchmarks.  Amongst other benefits, this would assist the control engineer in choosing tuning strategies 

which are consistent with plant characteristics and operating objectives.

"Transition metal complexes play an important role in synthesis and catalysis but reaction intermediates are often too unstable to be isolated. The proposed studies will be directed towards understanding fundamental interactions of late transition metal complexes. By studying compounds with new and diverse ligand frameworks, new types of species can be characterized which can provide valuable insight into bonding and reaction mechanisms in organometallic chemistry. This can lead to fundamentally new types of transition metal-mediated transformations through a prudent selection of metal and ligand. 



The research direction in the group is oriented towards designing novel highly active catalysts for olefin polymerization and cross coupling reactions with an emphasis on synthetic simplicity, high yields, and high electronic and steric ""tunability"". Special emphasis will be paid to mechanism elucidation. Challenges in cross-coupling reactions include increasing reaction scope, including aryl chlorides and sterically hindered substrates, and ability to conduct couplings at very low catalyst concentrations and at lower temperatures. The need to perform cross coupling reactions at low catalyst loadings exists not only to minimize the amount of metal and ligand for economic reasons but also to allow these coupling reactions to be used on a large scale while minimizing the effort required for removal of the metal from the final product. No single ligand has yet demonstrated the ability to satisfy the diverse requirements of cross-coupling reactions.

Spintronic circuits have the potential for extreme increases in computer processing speed and for reducing the power necessary to run the computer.

A unifying characteristic of the systems we study is that they are effectively two-dimensional.  We make spin measurements in conventional semiconductor materials, like the 2D conducting layer of GaAs found in a  cell-phone transistor, and in novel materials like graphene--a single atomic layer of carbon atoms, the two-dimensional building block of graphite.  The most effective external parameter for gaining control over electron spins in an experiment is magnetic field.  But most magnetic fields affect both the charge and the spin of an electron, so it is often difficult to disentangle which field effects are associated with spin.



Magnetic fields that are perfectly aligned with the 2D samples we measure do not create the confusion mentioned above, because they affect only the spin.  This proposal is for a magnet that allows independent control of the magnetic field direction, in order to achieve this level of perfect alignment.  It will enable us to build on the success we have achieved so far, investigating new types of spin behaviors in electronic circuits, and pushing forward the march to successful spintronics.

"Our group uses single molecules and lithographically-defined nanostructures as quantum mechanical electronic devices. The work has implications for our fundamental understanding of quantum entanglement, measurement, and control, and of correlated electron physics, with  potential applications for classical and quantum spintronics, and quantum information processing.  The properties of the nanostructures measured in our lab depend both on tunable extrinsic factors such as geometry, magnetic field, and control voltages, and intrinsic properties such as the molecular structure or band structure.  The combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors offers a wide degree of flexibility in the type of measurements that can be pursued.  For example:



- Electrons in single sheets of carbon atoms (graphene) behave very similar to photons.  Graphene nanostructures are a tunable testbed to study quantum electrodynamics in a tabletop experiment.  Other properties of graphene--e.g. strength, inertness, and low mass--may enable a variety of device applications.

- Spin-orbit interaction is an intrinsic property known from atomic physics, which creates an effective magnetic field for electrons as they move through a crystal.  By building nanostructures in strong spin-orbit materials, external voltages can control electrons' trajectories (their momenta) to rotate spins in a spintronic circuit. 

- Dumbbell-shaped molecules have an inherent bistability: an extra charge can live either on the left or the right end.  Integrating these molecules with semiconductor circuit elements that detect the motion of a single charge bridges the gap between molecular and conventional electronics.



The projects described above give a flavor of the breadth of research that may be accomplished using quantum devices.  This proposal describes these and related research topics in greater detail.

"A convective cloud is one which grows vertically. Examples include fair weather cumulus clouds, and cumulonimbus clouds which grow into thunderstorms. These clouds generate almost all of the rainfall in the tropics, and most of the summer rainfall in mid-latitudes. The small size of these clouds makes them difficult to represent in global weather forecast models. These models divide the atmosphere into grid boxes with a typical horizontal length of 100 km. Not surprisingly, the rainfall generated by convective clouds is also very difficult to forecast. In fact, current weather forecast models are unable to forecast tropical rainfall more accurately than very primitive statistical methods. Much of the rainfall in the tropics occurs in association with the movement of large coherent groups of thunderstorms, of which hurricanes are one example. One of these coherent groups, known as the MJO, has been shown to have a significant influence on mid-latitude 1 - 2 week forecasts. This research is designed to improve the way global models currently represent the effects of convective clouds. These improvements should lead to better rainfall forecasts. Convective clouds also have a strong influence on the concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere. They inject moist, saturated air into the upper troposphere, and generate rainfall which evaporates and moistens the atmosphere as it falls. Water vapor is also the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Its concentration is likely to change in response to current and future increases in carbon dioxide. Uncertainty over the magnitude of this change is perhaps the dominant source of uncertainty in the projections of global climate models. Improvements in the way models represent convective clouds should therefore also improve the climate predictions of these models.

"The proposed research program consists of synthesis and characterization of new ligand sets bearing both acidic and basic functionalities, coordination of these ligands to transition metals, and studies of the reactivity of resulting complexes in the activation and functionalization of alkanes and other typically inert substrates. The development of such a concept would entail, in the early stages, the synthesis of different ligand sets bearing the appropriate arrangement of functionalities. These ligands would contain one acidic site and between one and three metal-coordinated atoms. In this manner, the acidic functionality could be oriented toward the expected reactive site. The backbones of the ligands would be based on litterature precedents and modified by slightly varying the different acidic and basic functions, so that their interactions are weak enough to be broken and to allow for effective coodination to various metal centers. 

Next, we would study the coordination of these ligands to transition metals that are known to be active for alkane activation. Using reactive metal precursors with labile leaving groups, the coordination of the bifunctional ligand to the metal should be facile and the energy necessary to break any intramolecular donor-acceptor bonds should be easily overcome. Consequently, new interactions will be established between transition metal centers and tethered Lewis acids, which will potentially serve as modes for interactions present in traditional Lewis-acid co-catalyzed systems. 

Once such complexes are synthesized, their reactivity in alkane activation will be studied. It is expected that the presence of the active metal center and the Lewis acid activator in a single complex will increase the reactivity of these catalysts, as observed in many organic transformatinos. Both the Lewis and the transition metal would work cooperatively to improve the overall activity.","Advancement of knowledge","Inorganic & Organic Chemistry"

"This project is targeted at the development of a framework for plant-wide decision-making that can provide effective support for operations that: 1) exhibit multi-mode operations; 2) a mixture of continuous and discrete decision variables; 3) is focused on decision support rather than operations automation; 4) will provide insight into operations changes that will improve performance (e.g., process limitations that are restricting further performance improvement); and 5) will provide this functionality within a distributed optimization structure, which will allow local decision-makers to operate within their own domains with full knowledge of the global impact of their decisions.



A crucial component of this project is the development of novel approaches to interface design. The output from decision support systems is generally displayed to the decision-maker using graphics whose origins date back more than three decades and do not effectively present critical sensitivity information to the user. This project will investigate the development of user interfaces that provide decision-makers with all of the information they need to make effective choices, including identification of optimal operating variable values and the sensitivity of these optimal values with respect to assumed process parameters.

"Online optimization is widely used in the chemical process industries to ensure competitiveness though a high level of process performance. Common applications of online optimization in these industries include real-time optimization (RTO), model-predictive control (MPC), reactive scheduling, supply-chain optimization, and so forth. These online optimization technologies are, typically, complex and require regular maintenance to ensure their continued high performance (i.e., the performance of these automation systems degrade over time due to a number of factors). Thus, a key, but currently missing, element of online optimization systems is an effective performance analysis subsystem, which would include: performance monitoring, failure detection, and failure diagnosis.

      The work proposed in this application will focus on RTO and MPC, which are two of the most common online optimization technologies. One of the critical challenges in analyzing the performance of RTO and MPC using operating data is that their operation is very dependent on the fidelity of the process model on which they are based. Any modeling errors (e.g., parameter mismatch or structural mismatch) can result in the underlying optimizer incorrectly identifying process constraints that should be limiting the achievable level of performance and the reduced gradient of the performance objective. This can result in the optimizer driving the process into areas of operation that actually decrease performance. Furthermore, unlike the currently available controller performance assessment techniques, there are no performance benchmarks (e.g., the minimum variance benchmark) available for comparison purposes. 

     The proposed research program is targeted at the development of the set of fundamental tools and ideas from which a comprehensive performance analysis and failure diagnosis framework can be constructed. The results from the research program will be tested using an industrially-relevant, pilot-scale distillation system and industrial case studies.

"Systematics (including the field of taxonomy) is the science of identification, classification, and naming of all the earth's plants and animals. The knowledge gained from taxonomic research unifies all areas of biology by establishing a conceptual framework for interpreting the properties and activities of all organisms. In my lab, I conduct taxonomic research on sedges (Cariceae) - an assemblage of grass-like plants composed of three main groups (Carex, Vignea and Caricoid clades) and over 2100 species. Sedges are one of the most widespread and ecologically important groups of flowering plants. In Canada, they dominate vast areas of the north, and many wetland and forested habitats. Despite the significance of sedges, many species are considered difficult to distinguish from one another (taxonomically complex) and evolutionary relationships (phylogenies) are only just beginning to be understood. The long-term objectives of my research are to gain a better understanding of taxonomically difficult groups and to produce a revised phylogeny of these plants. In pursuit of these goals, I am proposing to undertake three projects. For the first two projects, a phylogeny of the Vignea and Caricoid clades will be produced using morphological and DNA sequence data. By incorporating the results of this study with data from our previous analyses, I hope to answer such questions as: What major evolutionary trends occur within the Vignea and Caricoid clades? What are the relationships among the genera/sections that comprise these clades? Are Vignea and Caricoid clades distinct evolutionary units (monophyletic)? The answers to these questions are fundamental to our understanding of evolution in sedges. For the third project, I propose to conduct a taxonomic revision of the C. deflexa complex (sect. Acrocystis), one of the many taxonomically difficult groups of sedges in North America. In this project, morphological variation will be studied by examining specimens collected from throughout the geographic range of this group. The main objectives are to determine patterns of morphological diversity and, in conjunction with ecologic and geographic information, produce a revised classification of the complex.

"Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) has rapidly become an important laboratory tool for studies of human disease in rodent models.  Like computed tomography (CT) scans performed in radiology departments on human subjects, micro-CT scanners use x-ray images acquired at different angles around the subject to produce high quality, 3D images of the anatomy.  However, micro-CT scanners are highly specialized to provide high-resolution images of the small structures inside rodents, such as the branching airways in the lungs, or the vessels bringing oxygen and nutrients to a tumour.  

One advantage of using micro-CT imaging techniques is the non-invasive nature of these techniques.  Using 3D x-ray imaging, researchers can see what is happening inside the animal.  Disease progression or how the animal is responding to treatment can be monitored by performing micro-CT scans at specified timepoints and analysing the images to diagnose the disease, monitor its spread or determine how well the treatment is performing.  During micro-CT imaging sessions, the subjects are exposed to x-ray radiation, which is commonly used in radiation therapy to treat cancer.  The goal of this research is to study the imaging technique to determine if there are interactions between the x-ray radiation received during imaging and the disease model under investigation for longitudinal imaging studies.  In particular, I aim to optimize the imaging techniques to ensure that the radiation received will not cause additional disease or complications that may compromise the health of the animals, and the results of the study.  I also aim to ensure that in cancer models, the radiation received during the imaging sessions is not inadvertently treating the tumours, and potentially causing the researchers to wrongly attribute the reduction in tumours to a new treatment that is being tested. 

This research will provide insight into the physics governing the interactions between the radiation received during x-ray imaging and tissue, and aims to provide a guideline outlining the optimal imaging parameters for longitudinal micro-CT studies.

"Why is an elastic band elastic?  What makes a rope stiff?  How do our tendons absorb forces when we run?  These questions relate to the elasticity and viscosity (""viscoelasticity"") of these materials, that is, how much they deform and then return to their original shape when stress is applied and released.  To design materials for specific mechanical purposes is a difficult problem, as there are many different factors to take into account.  Consider the required properties of an artificial tendon:  it must have a viscoelastic response similar to a native tendon, matching its stress-strain characteristics under varying conditions of load (running, walking, resting); it must exhibit these properties at and around body temperature; and it must be biocompatible, both in its long-term stability in our bodies and in its inertness (lack of toxicity) with respect to the surrounding tissues.  Designing a material with specified mechanical, thermal, chemical and temporal response, and understanding this response at the molecular level are important and extremely complex problems.   We propose to simplify the problem by reducing the number of molecules in the material - instead of examining tendons, we are looking at the molecules they comprise, one at a time.  After characterizing the mechanical response of these building blocks, we will then combine these blocks to build more complex systems like a tendon.



The molecular building blocks for many of the structural tissues in our bodies are collagen and elastin, which assemble (sometimes with each other or other molecules) to form tendons, arteries, skin and many other tissues.  Collagen-based tissues tend to be quite stiff, while elastin provides extensibility over billions of stretch-relax cycles.  To replace these natural proteins with rationally engineered versions requires understanding what forces are responsible for the stability and viscoelasticity of these biomaterials.  We hope our studies on the mechanical response of collagen and elastin molecules will lead to a greater understanding of the factors responsible for viscoelasticity and will help in efforts to design versatile alternatives.

"    )	            When chromosomes are not distributed equally into the two daughter cells during cell division, the resultant cells die or become abnormal, e.g., leading to birth defects or cancers. We study how chromosomes move to the two daughter cells. As chromosomes move to the two ""poles"" of the cell before the cell divides, a ""spindle fibre"" extending between each chromosome and the pole shortens without changing width. We can compare this to a boat connected by a rigid rope to a dock toward which it moves. The prevailing view is that a winch pulls the rope to the dock. We have shown, however, that other forces propel the boat: the boat continues to move normally to the dock after we sever the rope (by local irradiation), so external forces (from a ""spindle matrix"") must propel the boat to the dock - e.g., people  might stand in the shallow water and pull the remnant rope to the dock, or currents in the water might propel the boat to the dock. We have used specific drugs to identify which (non-rope) components might produce forces; we will use local irradiations, drug treatments, and genetic tools to identify and study the forces that propel the rope and boat to the dock.

                    )	Different boats moving to the docks do not move independently: they coordinate their movements. We have identified several communication pathways by irradiating specific locations in the division apparatus and seeing that movements of specific chromosomes were altered. We want to study the structure of the irradiated sites to see which components are altered.

"Heteroaromatics play a large role in the discovery of new molecules with important biological properties for the pharmaceutical industry. Thus, the development of novel synthetic methods remains a key challenge. The main limitation of common reactions, such as the Suzuki and Stille cross-couplings, is the employment of stoichiometric amounts of organometallic species that must be prepared in separate chemical transformations and generate chemical by-product waste. The primary goal of our research program is to explore carboxylic acids as surrogates for the organometallic species in carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. Nature has evolved effective decarboxylative coupling processes for the preparation of carbon-carbon bonds, such as in the synthesis of fatty acids.  However, until recently, these have been under utilized by organic chemists as synthetic tools. My previous work revealed that 2-carboxylic acid-heteroaromatics are useful cross-coupling partners that undergo efficient coupling with aryl halides. This approach provides an entry into a new field of research, where carboxylic acids now function as organometallic surrogates in cross-coupling reactions. This reactivity is important due to the inherent novelty, as well as industrially since these coupling partners are widely available commercially and indefinitely stable. Gaining insight into the operative mechanism of the decarboxylative coupling is essential to capitalize further on this technology. Longer-term goals will involve highlighting the practical uses of the coupling through the synthesis of versatile heteroaromatic products as well as the rapid screening of heteroaromatic substructures against biological targets. Further extensions will explore other metal surrogates such as sulfinic acids, which will undergo de-sulfinylation more readily than the corresponding carboxylic acid due to the weaker carbon-sulfur bond. Our research program, decarboxylative metal catalyzed couplings, is in its infancy, but this burgeoning and recently highlighted field will mark a paradigm shift in the choice of coupling partners in the synthesis of pharmaceutically important heteroaromatics.

"Numerous reports and studies recognize the construction industry poor performance in delivering a quality product on time and on budget. Some associate this problem with the way building are planned, designed and delivered. The non-involvement of builders in the design process and the fragmentation of the design work between specialties engender a lack of iterations, a lack of consideration of constraints within subsequent phases and a lack of leadership and accountability. This leads to suboptimal solutions, poor constructability and operability, rework in design and construction and lack of innovation. These problems are more critical in sustainable construction, in which a larger variety of expertise is required to achieve the expected performance at a competitive price.

Authors suggest adopting an integrated and iterative design approach to address these problems, or to deploy configurational systems, namely Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems to create a virtual collaborative environment. However, while the problems with sequential design and delivery approach to construction have been discussed, the topic of the impact of integrated teams or virtual collaborative work on traditional design practices has been little researched.  As observed in our researches on the dynamic of integrated teams, there are two problems hindering their performance. First, traditional tools used by design professionals in a sequential design process proved to be inappropriate for iterative problem-solving required in an integrated process.  Second, design professionals had great difficulty to break the boundaries created by their specialized knowledge to efficiently co-produce innovative solutions. The aim of the research is to improve integrated team performance in designing sustainable construction.

"Fourier analysis has historically been used to study problems from classical physics. In particular, those physical processes that invovle waves of some form. The goal is to break complex information down into much easier to understand components. For example a sound can be decomposed into its natural harmonic frequencies. This information can then be used to reproduce the sound quite accurately. Moreover, this reproduction can often be achieved from a rather small portion of information. 



Like sounds, mathematical functions are also built up from simple components. Classical harmonic analysis looks at ways in which this can be done. My research area, abstract harmonic analysis, is an abstraction of the mathematics of Fourier analysis that owes its origins also to the modern theory of quantum mechanics. In this theory functions are replaced by more exotic objects called Hilbert space operators. I study the links between these operators and certain algebraic objects called locally compact groups. 



There are a number of practical application related to this branch of mathematics. These include signal processing, medical image processing and computer graphics.

"The swine industry in Canada is a multibillion-dollar business with approximately 14 million pigs on farms. The three major nutrients for their growth and development are carbohydrate, protein and phosphorus, and these are provided by cereal grains and plant protein supplements. Phosphorus, the third major nutrient, is present in these feed components largely in the form of phytic acid, which is not digestible by the pig. To solve the inability to digest phytate we have genetically enhanced a line of Yorkshire pigs trademarked ""EnviropigTM"" to secrete the enzyme phytase in the salivary that enables digestion of phytate in the stomach with the release of phosphate which is readily absorbed in the small intestine. Since supplementation of the diet with available phosphate is unnecessary, there is greater utilization of the phosphorus in the cereals with a corresponding reduction of phosphorus in the manure by as much as 60%. Therefore, these pigs cost marginally less to feed, and they produce manure that has less pollution potential. We have done extensive testing which documents that the pigs grow normally, are identical to conventional pigs in all other ways other than salivary phytase production, and that the non-allergenic phytase protein is present only in the salivary glands and some secretory glands of the upper respiratory tract. The objective of this research is to complete the food safety assessment and stability testing of phenotypic expression, and to assess the effect of manure from the Enviropigs as a fertilizer for plant growth. The final objective is to develop a website containing food and environmental safety information, and efficacy data that will provide an inexpensive, but efficient conduit for global access by regulators, investors, scientists, producers, and consumers, and their various organizations. We will conduct the animal studies and assemble the information for the website, while the plant research will be completed through collaboration with soil scientists, and the database assembled with assistance of information management experts.","Animal production and animal primary products","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"

"Many species of bacteria communicate with each other through a cell density dependent signaling system, termed quorum sensing. These signals are mediated by small hormone-like molecules and allow a population of bacteria to co-ordinate their gene expression and activities. It is becoming evident that certain components of the quorum sensing system can also influence the behavior of eukaryotic cells. Of particular interest is the emerging data suggesting that a certain class of quorum sensing molecules produced by gram-negative bacteria, acyl homoserine lactones (AHL), can modulate mammalian immune responses. Preliminary data from my laboratory indicate that certain AHL inhibit mast cell responses to bacterial components and antigen without influencing cell viability. Mast cells play an important role in host defense, acting as sentinels of the immune system, strategically located at sites that interface with our external environment. They are rapidly activated in response to bacterial infection, and can be crucial for the early recruitment of effector cells such as neutrophils. Thus the mast cell is a highly relevant target cell in which to study this poorly understood form of inter-kingdom communication that likely plays an important role in mediating both detrimental and beneficial interactions between mammals and their microbiota. The experiments proposed in this application will examine AHL mediated regulation of mast cell function by; 1) determining the influence of AHL on mast cell activity, 2) delineating mast cell signaling pathways modulated by AHL, 3) identifying potential mammalian receptors for AHL.

Inter-kingdom signaling is an emerging field of research that offers exciting possibilities for novel insights into the interactions between bacteria and their host. The proposed study will increase our knowledge in this area and allow us to better understand not only pathogenic interactions but also commensal and symbiotic relationships that are vital for the normal functioning of many of our own biological systems.

"The heat engine inside the rocky mantle below Earth's crust is characterised by the very large scale transport of mass and heat across vertical and horizontal distances of thousands of kilometres inside our planet. This continuous flow of hot rock, termed thermal convection, exerts forces which drive the horizontal 'drift' of the surface tectonic plates, generating deformations in the crust which are relaxed by large, often destructive earthquakes. These deep Earth forces also produce vertical displacements of the continents and ocean floor across distances of hundreds of metres, thereby producing relative sea level variations which have indundated large portions of continental interiors in the geologic past. These vertical movements can also change the external shape of the Earth to such an extent that they perturb its orbital inclination relative to the Sun and can thus affect the evolution of climate cycles on our planet. In this proposal we provide an ambitious and exciting series of new initiatives to directly model and predict the dynamical impact of mantle convection on these wide ranging surface processes which have shaped the evolution of Earth's surface environment over geological time spans. Through refinements of numerical convection codes which we are developing to reconstruct the evolution of Earth's interior in the geologic past, we will model fundamental dynamical processes affecting two continents in particular, North America and Africa, and these include: (1) dynamic surface topography and erosion; (2) (in)stability of coastal margins and sea level variations; (3) surface stress patterns and earthquake activity. Using these convection models we will also make detailed predictions of the global-scale changes of Earth's external shape and rotation variations over the past 60 million years, thus providing new insights on how mantle convection may affect Earth's palaeoclimate cycles. We will also seek to substantially improve our knowledge of the 3-D mantle structure by carrying out a new series of joint inversions of global seismic and convection data. These innovative investigations into the workings of the Earth System will be advanced by the participation and training of HQP and through multiple international collaborations which we will foster.

"Permafrost covers about 45% of Canada and therefore Northern landscape evolution is highly dependent on the dynamics of permafrost aggradation and degradation through time. Climatic changes play a key role in the dynamics of permafrost. Changing temperature, precipitation and sedimentary regimes affect the thermal state and the mechanics of permafrost. On the long term, the projected climate warming scenarios for Northern Canada suggest that the permafrost will be markedly affected. These changes will have a profound impact on northern ecosystems via changes in the physical environment and the hydrological cycle. Where the ground is ice-rich the adjustment of the permafrost to climatic conditions will induce thermokarst and thermo-erosion processes related to erosion, ground ice melting, thaw-settlement and mass movement of the surface.  These natural processes will be further exacerbated by human activities. In the recent decades, Northern permafrost regions of Canada have experienced a sustained growth and are expected to undergo a tremendous development in the near future. Population growth, as well as oil, gas and mining exploration require the construction of additional roads, railways, airstrips and pipelines which create heavy pressures on the environment. The construction of infrastructures inevitably affects the thermal regime of the underlying permafrost through disturbance of the surface. Recurrent maintenance operations, rehabilitation, reconstruction and relocalization of damaged infrastructures will become very costly.  This general objective of this research program is to answer pressing questions of permafrost degradation in natural settings and applied to transport infratsructures. This research program proposes to adopt a field-based geomorphological approach to study the fundamentals of permafrost degradation processes on various time scales (year to decades) and to develop engineering techniques to prevent permafrost degradation and to rehabilitate (re-freeze) thawed permafrost.  This research program will help Canadian communities, governments and the industry to develop science-based adaptation strategies to cope with warming and changing permafrost environments.

Mobilized for science thanks to a major grant from the Canada Foundation for Innovation, the Major Resource comprised of the research icebreaker Amundsen and its pool of state-of-the-science instruments has revitalized Canadian research in the Arctic and played a pivotal role in the deployment of Canada's remarkable contribution to the International Polar Year (2007-2008). Since 2003, the Amundsen has logged an impressive 1006 days at sea for international science, supporting major Canadian-led projects such as the Canadian Arctic Shelf Exchange Study (CASES), the Inuit Health Surveys, ArcticNet, Arctic-SOLAS and the Circumpolar Flaw Lead System Study. Internationally, the Resource has contributed equipment and technical expertise to the multinational Nansen-Amundsen Basins Observatory System (NABOS) study since 2003. Starting in 2009, it will host the French-led MALINA, a study of air-sea interactions in the Arctic Ocean.



As the spectacular impacts of climate warming unfold in the Arctic, the demand for the Resource is swelling despite the soaring costs of arctic logistics. All in all, the Amundsen has been one of the most successful large research facilities in Canada, propelling the country in the leading pack of nations studying the transformation of the Arctic World. Direct benefits for Canada include a consolidation of its scientific presence in the Arctic; a contribution to the affirmation of its sovereignty over its arctic seas; the training of the next generation of Canadian specialist of the Arctic Ocean in a multidisciplinary and international context; a continuity of the Canadian arctic effort that allows the long-term planning of major scientific programs; a unique research capacity that supports the Canadian contribution to the International Polar Year and helps ensure its legacy.

L'objectif du programme de recherche propos� est d'anticiper la r�ponse des �cosyst�mes des mers glac�es � une r�duction de la banquise, en quantifiant et en mod�lisant les liens actuels entre couvert de glace, temp�rature des eaux de surface et production biologique.

Dans les eaux arctiques, la dur�e de la saison d'eau libre contr�le la production annuelle totale des microalgues, de m�me que la reproduction et la croissance pr�-hivernale du zooplancton et des poissons. Nous quantifions les impacts de la variabilit� du couvert de glace sur les cop�podes arctiques et les juv�niles de morue arctique, une esp�ce cl� du r�seau trophique. 

   2) Couvert de glace et flux verticaux de carbone particulaire. Le couvert de glace d�termine le flux de carbone biog�nique particulaire qui s�dimente vers le fond des mers polaires.

"Earth's climate is warming and the sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean and its ancillary seas is shrinking. By 2030, the immense arctic continental shelves (6 millions km2) could be ice-free from spring to fall. The objective of the proposed research is to anticipate the response of marine arctic ecosystems to a reduction of the sea-ice cover by quantifying and modeling the present links between sea-ice, sea surface temperature and biological production. 

   1) Ice cover and the export of primary production to the trophic web. In arctic waters, the duration of the ice-free season determines the total annual production by microalgae as well as the reproduction and pre-winter development of the zooplankton and juvenile fish. We quantify the impacts of variability and change in sea-ice cover duration on arctic copepods and juveniles of the arctic cod, a key species in the ecosystem. 

   2) Ice cover and the vertical flux of particulate carbon. The sea-ice cover controls the amount of particulate biogenic carbon that sinks to the bottom of the ocean. The amount of atmospheric CO2 that could be sequestered by an ice-free Arctic Ocean is unknown. In relation with the duration of the snow and ice covers, we measure inter-annual variations in the intensity and nature of the vertical flux of particulate carbon and quantify the fraction of the vertical flux that transit through zooplankton.

   3) Coupled physical-biological models of ice-covered seas. Numerical simulations are needed to anticipate the potential response of arctic marine ecosystems to climate warming and a reduction of the sea-ice cover. We develop simple physical-biological models of sea-ice and the life cycle of the main arctic copepods, as well as a individual-based model of the survival of pre-juvenile arctic cod in relation to ice-cover duration, for the North Water (northern Baffin Bay) and the Mackenzie Shelf (Beaufort Sea).

"Clostridium difficile is now considered as one of the most important pathogen responsible for nosocomial infections in North America and Europe, especially among the elderly. Virulence of C. difficile relies mainly on two toxins (TcdA and TcdB) and on the ability to sporulate and persist in the environment. The recent genome sequencing from a virulent strain of C. difficile revealed several mobile genetic elements, including a plasmid and two complete prophages. Thus, horizontal gene transfer is most likely an important mechanism for the evolution of this pathogen. However, prophages and plasmids of C. difficile have only been poorly studied so far and according to their role in virulence of other pathogens, there is a need to better characterize them and assess their impact on the biology and evolution of C. difficile. In addition, efficient molecular tools for the genetic manipulation of C. difficile remain very limited, which blocks further fundamental studies. Our long-term objective is to characterize prophages and plasmids from C. difficile and to develop molecular tools for its genetic manipulation in order to get insight into the ecology, diversity, virulence and evolution of this bacterium. A collection of ~1,000 strains will be classified by molecular techniques, and prophages within the genome of these strains will be identified and characterized at the microbiological and molecular level, including whole genome sequencing.  Plasmids will also be isolated, sequenced and fully characterized. The distribution of prophages and plasmids across our C. difficile collection will be determined, which will hopefully give us clues about their role and impact on C. difficile ecology and evolution. Finally, these plasmids will be used to develop molecular tools (e.g. vectors) to manipulate the C. difficile genome. For the first time, this study will provide data about prophage diversity in a large collection of C. difficile strains. We will also gain fundamental data regarding C. difficile plasmids and their potential function(s). New virulence or fitness factors are expected to be found within these mobile genetic elements, which could help us better understand the microbial diversity of C. difficile.","Advancement of knowledge","Molec. & Develop.

"Multicarrier (MC) modulation is present in several standards for wireless communications systems (e.g. 802.11, 802.16) and is being considered for future wideband mobile systems. In this proposal, we will study the combination of MC modulation and low density parity check (LDPC) codes, particularly from an efficient VLSI implementation point of view. LDPC codes have been incorporated or are being considered for incorporation in several wireless communications standards. New codes are being proposed for various transmission conditions. The objectives of the proposed research are to continue our investigation on highly parallel structures and study how these can be combined efficiently with MC modulations. Of particular interest are the considerations of peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR), adaptive modulation and variable-rate and rate-compatible codes. To achieve these objectives, we will develop new architectures for LDPC codes, suitable for efficient implementations (e.g. using a small amount of resources and being fast) and able to achieve the data rate goals of future wideband access systems (i.e. 100's of Mbps to Gbps, depending on mobility). In parallel, we will also search for new LDPC codes that can offer good performance-complexity trade-offs. We will conduct extensive analytical studies and computer simulations. Some of our simulations will be done using ""hardware-in-the-loop"" techniques in order to diminish simulation time and consider implementation issues. For example, field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) circuits available in our laboratory, will be extensively used. This project will provide useful results that can be transferred to Canadian industry, helping Canada to be a major player in defining future wireless systems. Wideband wireless systems will be prevalent in the coming years and it is very important to train highly qualified personnel in this area.","Communications equipment","Commun.,Computers & Components"

"Le but de cette proposition est de poursuivre mes travaux en mod�lisation num�rique des probl�mes de m�canique des fluides. Plusieurs aspects diff�rents seront abord�s: 1) Estimation d'erreurs et maillage adaptatif: ce sujet constitue un aspect fondamental de mes travaux puisque ces m�thodes se retrouvent dans toutes les applications. Dans un premier temps, il nous faudra consolider les bases th�oriques sur lesquelles s'appuient nos estimateurs d'erreurs actuels.  Par la suite, je m'int�resserai � optimiser et parall�liser les m�thodes adaptatives actuelles dans le cas des probl�mes instationnaires. Ces probl�mes n�cessitent l'emploi de maillages diff�rents (et adapt�s) � chaque pas de temps ce qui donne lieu � des temps de calcul importants et quelque fois prohibitifs. 2) Fluides visco�lastiques: les r�cents d�veloppements en ce domaine permettent maintenant d'effectuer des simulations � des nombres de Weissenberg (Deborah) pertinents pour les applications industrielles. Je compte poursuivre les travaux en cours sur les formulations dites logarithmiques, introduites tout r�cemment, qui semblent lever les probl�mes de convergence rencontr�s dans ce type de simulations au cours des 20 derni�res ann�es. Ici encore, certains aspects th�oriques devront �tre abord�s concernant les types de discr�tisation des diff�rentes variables. Il faudra aussi am�liorer les m�thodes de r�solution pour diminuer les temps de calcul en vue d'applications industrielles. 3) Probl�mes � surfaces libres: de nombreuses applications industrielles requi�rent le calcul de surfaces libres sur laquelle des conditions sp�cifiques comme la tension superficielle doivent �tre impos�es. Entres autres probl�mes � surfaces libres, le gonflement en sortie de fili�re, la coextrusion, la d�formation de gouttelettes en �longation et en cisaillement  et le soufflage de gaines seront �tudi�s.

Il est reconnu que la r�ponse biologique (prise en charge/toxicit�) provoqu�e par plusieurs m�taux traces d�pend principalement de la concentration de l'ion m�tallique libre en solution. Cette relation a permis l'�laboration de mod�les simples afin de pr�dire la biodisponibilit� des m�taux.

"The ability to estimate short time intervals is involved in a variety of everyday human behaviors. Coordinating movements, playing music, driving a car in a moving environment, judging ""normal"" durations in social interactions (e.g., pauses in conversations, durations of visual contact or of a handshake) entail estimating time intervals in the second range. Numerous studies have revealed that in humans, accurate timing requires attention and memory. Evidence for this conclusion comes mainly from studies showing interference between timing tasks and tasks requiring attention and memory: when humans are asked to estimate time while doing simultaneously another task involving attention or memory, timing is systematically perturbed. This research program investigates the role of specific factors related to attention and memory in time estimation. When we expect an interruption in a stimulus that we are currently timing, our estimate of its duration is greatly affected, presumably because expectancy detracts attention from timing. In the first part of the program, we will analyze how the degree of certainty about the expectancy of an interruption influences our temporal estimate. Besides, our previous studies showed that preparation to interrupt or to resume timing affects time estimates also, which we will investigate further in the program. In the second part of the program, we will analyze the interference between timing and switching between different tasks. Recent data suggest that timing and task switching may interfere with each other. The switching conditions used in the experiments of the present program require coordinating mental activities in working memory, activities such as remembering temporal position in task sequences (e.g., which task comes before the other), planning and preparing to switch to a forthcoming task. In addition to uncovering specific cognitive processes involved in timing, the program will provide novel insights on the role of temporal processing when we must alternate between various tasks. Besides, in the past, our fundamental research on timing and attention has produced a useful paradigm sensitive to cognitive deficits related to aging. In the present program, similar developments are planned in more applied settings.

"HARNESSING COMPLEMENTARY DATA STRUCTURES TO SUPPORT CHANGE PROCESSES IN PRODUCT LIFECYCLE ACTIVITIES FOR EXTENDED PLM SOLUTIONS



The capacity of a company to innovate is directly related to its capacity to efficiently manage product evolutions or changes. Changes throughout the life of a complex product generate retroactive flows of information, which are most important for effective collaboration. These are still not well understood from a scientific point of view and are currently only supported by empirical practices and methodologies. This research proposal aims at discovering complementary data structures to formally support retroactive processes induced by product change across product lifecycle activities such as design, manufacturing and in service. The originality of this research lies in the study of complementary product data structures such as features, bill of materials, tolerances, process plans and manufacturing dispersions to effectively manage multidirectional flows of information within a PLM system. In simple terms, PLM is about integrating the various data management software developed for the different stages of the life of a product (CAD, CAM, PDM, FEA, Workflow management, etc.) in a comprehensive package destined to improve the information and data share between partners, clients and suppliers in a digital enterprise environment. The main hypothesis to be validated in this research work is that only complementary, rather than unified, data structures can effectively support multidirectional flows of information in the product lifecycle and thus advanced PLM solutions.

"The equipment requested will be used to gain a mechanistic understanding of the spatial organization of herbivores under predation risk. We will conduct research to identify the main determinants of the spatiotemporal dynamics of bison living under the risk of wolf predation at the interface between parklands and agricultural lands. We will then use this information to reduce wildlife-human conflicts by modifying connectivity in a resource patch network. The first step will be to characterize spatio-temporal patterns of predation risk within the bison range. To do so, we will track wolves from four different packs located within the bison range. These wolves will be equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) radio-collars. The second step will be to also follow bison also equipped with GPS collars to evaluate their movement decisions in this risky environment. We will then use graph theory to pin point parts of the resource patch network that, if impacted, should have strong and predictable effects on bison distribution. On this basis, we will carry out a landscape-scale experiment on the network by local - yet strategic - habitat modifications (e.g., by blocking trail sections, changing resource availability in meadows) to reduce cross-boundary movements by altering connectivity patterns and reorienting bison away from the park's boundaries. The proposed research is innovative because it will go beyond the simple description of distribution patterns and resource selection by revealing the behavioural mechanisms involved in the selection process. The approach to influencing animal distribution will combine rigorous science and adaptive management, which will speed the development of innovative and effective management actions of conservation significance. Free-ranging plains bison populations are threatened in Canada (COSEWIC, May 2004). Cross-boundary movements may jeopardize the free-ranging nature of these bison. Our work will help bison management by increasing our ability to predict and control their distribution.","Wildlife management","Evolution and Ecology"

"Molecular imaging allows modern medicine to examine the functions of molecules and cells in living organisms. Diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis and Alzheimer, can now be detected precisely and non-invasively at a much earlier stage. Imaging scanners have reached a high level of development and henceforth intense efforts are being invested in the development of biomarkers with improved properties. This research program addresses a crucial aspect of molecular imaging: the development of contrast agents and tracers (biomarkers) providing high and specific signal in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). In fact, a next generation of scanners combining MRI and PET will soon become a reality in the clinic. MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique providing high resolution pictures in low density tissues. Magnetic molecules or nanoparticles are often necessary to finely delineate the vasculature, to precisely identify disease artefacts, and to track cells. The rather poor sensibility per unit of biomarker is the major limitation of MRI, which requires the use of large amounts of magnetic metals in-vivo. PET is also a non-invasive imaging technique, based on the detection of radioactive tracers at very high sensitivity. This method requires very small quantities of radioactive atoms; the resolution however remains lower than with MRI. At present, both imaging techniques (MRI and PET) can be used separately for studying physiological features and molecular targets. Could we perform both MRI and PET at the same time? Magnetic metal colloids in the form of nanoparticles, can be used to improve the specificity of the MRI signal. By doping these crystalline ""nanomaterials"" with carefully selected radioactive atoms, a next generation of biomarkers could become available for dual PET/MRI procedures. This research program focuses on the synthesis, characterization and signal study of dual contrast agents produced in the form of magnetoradioactive colloids. In the long term, such colloids could be used as molecular tags, as cell markers, and also as enhancers of MRI contrast for biomedical devices.

"Species at all ecological level of organizations (individual, population, community) are affected by landscape spatial heterogeneity. In turn, such spatial heterogeneity is modified by the synergistic interactions among natural disturbances and global change (climate and landuse change).   Examination of species spatial distributions and their dynamics through time can help to better understand the resulting effects of the combined ecological and environmental pressures that they are faced with.  To disentangle the relative importance of these multiple pressures at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales, my long-term research objective is to develop spatial and spatio-temporal analytical methods to investigate the synergistic effects of natural disturbances and global change on species spatial distributions and persistence at multiple spatial scales and organizational levels.  To this end, over the next five years my research group will investigate how species traits and species-level processes (individual movement, population dispersal, inter-specific interactions, predator-prey dynamics and community shifts) are affected by multiple disturbances.  I will be focusing on a series of research projects that can be grouped into the following research objectives: (1) quantify the spatial dynamic of species distributions and assemblages; (2) investigate species spatial responses to landscape spatial heterogeneity as modified by disturbances and global change at the home range and geographical range levels; (3) modify undirected spatial graph algorithms designed for terrestrial landscapes in order to quantify (i) temporal connectivity, (ii) stream network (riverscape) directionally, (iii) predator-prey spatial interactions, and (iv) to compare and test for significant differences among spatial graphs based on landscape and genetic connectivity; and (4) integrate these new spatial and temporal graph algorithms to use them to select reserve networks that can functionally persist through time given forecasted global changes.  These research projects will set the foundation of several future research avenues and analytical developments that will determine how space matters to the maintenance of biodiversity as well as species interactions through time.",Environment,"Evolution & Ecology"

"Structural performance is influenced by many variables, the values of which are not known with certainty. Because of this randomness, there always exist the possibility that the structure will not perform as intended. Performance-based design aims at designing a structure so that the probabilities of non-performance, under different performance criteria, will not exceed tolerable limits while, at the same time, some structural attribute (like total cost) will be minimized. This proposal refers to the final development of robust software for calculating probabilities of non-performance and implementing performance-based design. The proposal aims, in particular, at applications in earthquake engineering and to calibration of codified seismic design procedures. The software RELAN and IRELAN, to be finalized, have been in continuous development at the University of British Columbia and are freely available. Calibration of seismic code design provisions will concentrate, as an example, on the case of the city of Vancouver. The proposal also includes continuing research collaboration with IMAE, the Institute of Applied Mechanics and Structures of the University of Rosario, Argentina. This collaboration also emphasizes reliability and performance-based design in earthquake engineering.

"Neurotrophins (NTs) such a nerve growth factor and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are best known for their effects on neurite survival and differentiation. The effects of NTs are mediated by two classes of receptors, the tyrosine receptor kinases (TrK) which include Trk A, Trk B, and Trk C, and a low affinity receptor p75NTR. NTs and their receptors have recently been localized to many different cell types throughout the body including the ovary. I have recently shown by immunohistochemistry and Western blot that Trk B is expressed in endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) and our recent results show that EECs express BDNF. However, the mechanism(s) regulating the expression of NTs and their cognate receptors in the reproductive tract are unknown. I hypothesize that BDNF and Trk B are important regulators in granulosa cell (GC) and EEC proliferation and survival. I further propose that environmental toxicants (ETs) will change BDNF, Trk B and p75NTR expression in GCs and EECs, changes that are potentially important in reproductive disorders of domestic animals and humans. Therefore, the follicle stage dependent expression of BDNF, Trk B, and p75NTR in ovarian follicles will be measured using a novel isolated mouse follicle culture system already established in my laboratory. NT effects on follicle growth and markers of GC apoptosis will also be quantifed. I will show that the documented ovarian toxic effects of ETs such as 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide, arochlor 1254, PCB 77, and dioxin modulate follicle growth and follicle demise through changes in NT expression. Finally, I hypothesize that NTs and their receptors are important regulators of EEC sruvival. I will demonstrate that ETs decrease BDNF and Trk B expression (mRNA and protein) in EECs. Results of this study will expand our understanding of the mechanisms regulating follicle growth and cumulus expansion in particular. Results of the planned studies will elucidate the mechanisms underlying the toxic effects of several established reproductive toxicants. Finally, successful completion of the planned experiments will demonstrate that toxicant-induced changes in BDNF and Trk B are an important novel mechanism of endocrine disruption.

"The long-term goal of this proposal is to combine research on the dynamics and control of flexible robot manipulators and navigation of mobile robots, into the studies of mobile manipulators. The purpose of mobile robot path planning is to find a path from a start position to a goal position with no collisions. The goal of mobile manipulators is being able to control motion of a robotic arm while it is mounted on a mobile robot and navigating in a crowded known or unknown setting. 

This type of robotic technology can be used in many Canadian industries such as farming and mining, or in Canadian contribution in space missions. Mobile Robotic Assistant can be seen as part of house keeping tasks in Mars mission, according to the European Space Agency. The robots can be used in environments hazardous for humans. This research will lead to new products (software for online path planning and vibration control), or services (navigation of robots working in hazardous environment, manufacturing, or research sectors).

This research program consists of both computer simulations and physical experiments. The novelty of the computer simulation phase is in admitting more flexibility in the manipulator's components by using Finite Element Analysis (FEA), computational efficiency, and integrating commercial software which are separately designed for FEA and control. The novelty of navigation and control of wheeled mobile robot in indoor and outdoor settings is on following a given velocity profile and navigation on an uneven surface. The novelty of motion planning and control of mobile manipulators is on its application to farming. Experimentation will be performed in a newly established robotics lab at the University of Saskatchewan, founded by a CFI equipment grant. The NSERC fund will be used to train graduate students and scientists who will be employed in industries, universities, and research sectors. Results will be transferred to practicing engineers in Canadian-based manufacturing industries, space scientists, and mining engineers, where I have already established collaboration, or contact.

"Until relatively recently, studies of polymers of Group 14 elements have been largely limited to those containing carbon. While research interest into the unique properties of polymers based on heavier Group 14 elements, polysilanes, polygermanes, and polystannanes has continued to increase, applications with these materials has been considerably more limited. Higher Group 14 polymers are in general both light and moisture sensitive, making them more difficult to prepare, isolate and use compared to conventional polymer systems. The highest polymers of Group 14 metals (Sn, Pb) represent a relatively untapped research area with catenated lead polymers, polyplumbanes, still unknown.  One of the unique properties of higher Group 14 polymers is the extensive delocalized sigma-sigma bond network created from overlap of elemental orbitals along the backbone, making these products optically and electronically interesting.  The potential to make highly conductive films, one-dimensional quantum wires and printable electronics with homopolymers of Sn and Pb have not been explored. This research will address the previous synthetic shortcomings of these unique materials and deliver the first examples of moisture and light stable polystannanes. Light stability will be accomplished by the introduction of light stabilizing side groups (UV absorbers (UVA), hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS)) to protect the backbone from photoscission reactions.  Moisture stability will be provided by the use of bulky hydrophobic or ring structures on the tin atom to improve resistance to moisture and other nucleophiles.  Polymerization of the above described monomers will be accomplished by dehydrogenative coupling of alkyl or aryl tin dihydrides and Wurtz coupling and electropolymerization of alkyl or aryl tin dichlorides. Metal catalyzed insertion of unsaturated hydrocarbons, (alkynes or benzynes) into the backbone of these polymers will also be investigated. Characterization and applications testing of these new polymers will also be undertaken.

"The growing use of a performance approach in concrete construction has increased the pressure to develop better tools for quickly and reliably evaluating the quality of concrete-making materials. Recent research has shown that many aggregates respond differently in ""performance"" tests compared to natural exposure conditions, sometimes resulting in poor quality aggregate materials being used at risk in concrete construction, or in good-quality aggregates being rejected. The objective of the research program is to improve our understanding of the influence of the compositional/physical properties of natural and recycled aggregates on their behaviour as concrete-making materials, either under ""accelerated"" laboratory conditions or when subjected to natural environment. Furthermore, the research program proposes to study how the reaction and expansion processes in different types of reactive coarse and fine aggregates, as well as through other deleterious processes, impact on the development of distress/damage in concrete. This will not only contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the degradation of concrete, but it should in turn contribute to a more reliable prediction and modeling of the performance of concrete infrastructure. Finally, as sources of good quality materials in the vicinity of large urban areas are depleting rapidly, which will likely increase the pressure for using marginal natural aggregates or recycled materials in concrete construction, a better understanding of how the properties of concrete-making materials influence the performance of the final product (concrete) and how it could reliably be evaluated through performance testing, is critical in a proper management scheme of our natural resources.","Construction, transportation and communications","Civil Engineering - A"

We are developing new theoretical methods and computer software for predicting

the geometric structure and physical properties of molecules.  We use a

combination of artificial intelligence (or ``machine learning'') and number crunching

(``quantum chemistry'') to explore the vast world of real and hypothetical

molecular structures and compositions.  Our goal is to create a computer software that could give

meaningful answers to general questions about chemistry, such as:

``What molecules have properties such that they would give materials that are magnetic and light?'', or, ``Are there stable cage-shaped molecules that do not contain carbon atoms?''.

We also try to improve algorithms in order to make atomistic simulations faster

and more accurate.  The possible applications that we are most interested in

are in the study of: (a) peptides, proteins, and their metal complexes;

(b) nanoalloys, their structure, magnetic properties, and catalytic activity.

"The role of the World's forests in climate regulation is now widely recognized and mechanisms are in place to use forests in influencing the carbon cycle. The scale of the phenomenon has made the estimation and mapping of forest parameters a global/national level priority. Remote sensing is the only effective means available to provide the needed information at the relevant scales. Past research has shown potentials and limitations of existing remote sensing techniques for a range of ecosystem types, from the densely vegetated and complex humid tropical forest to the sparse tree distribution of savannas. In the latter, traditional techniques based on spectral properties encounter problems differentiating the tree and grass signals, both being simultaneously photosynthetically active throughout most of the year. The objective of this research is to explore the potential of imagery directional resolution in improving tree biomass mapping accuracy in savannas. The proposed approach takes advantage of the prominent shadow patterns created by the spatial arrangement of trees in the savanna to estimate tree density and size, and ultimately link this information to tree biomass. This project represents an opportunity for the Canadian geomatics industry to consolidate its lead position at the international level and provides openings to export our expertise in a new field of application.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"
"The proposed research program is centered on the development of methods for inventory or mapping vegetated ecosystems (forestland and wetland) using remote sensing tools. There are two specific objectives targeted where the first one aims at improving existing techniques and developing new in situ measurement methods with remote sensing tools. In situ measurement methods provide in-depth measurements but on a limited number of sampled areas. Frequent gaps in inventory data sets raise the importance of new measurement alternatives with remote sensing tools. Three tools are particularly promising and innovative in the use of remote sensing for measurement of vegetated ecosystems: (1) hemispherical photography (HP), (2) terrestrial LiDAR (TLiDAR), and (3) model of vegetation canopy architecture. They provide a gradation of measurement details: HP is a 2D representation in polar plane of the canopy, TLiDAR is an explicit 3D sounding of canopy elements, and a canopy architecture model is a 3D representation of canopy that can extend the measure from remote sensing sensors.  The second specific objective aims at developing mapping methods of vegetated ecosystem from integration of multi-scale data. A gradation of scales is usually at work in the use of spatial data sets for vegetation ecosystems. In the case of optical sensors, measurements span from ground plots towards imagery from high spatial resolution for local and regional mapping, and gradually towards the lowest spatial resolution for national and global mapping. In my research program I priorize mapping projects at either local (~10cm to 4m) or regional levels (~10m to 100m). Many questions need to be addressed concerning the use of spatial data sets at different scale: How best to use plot data to train mapping methods? What are the alternatives to fill data gaps at different scales? How to integrate non image data to improve resulting maps? Aside specific multi-scale projects, we propose an overall framework to facilitate development of mapping methods. My research program thus provides measurement and mapping solutions applicable to a wide range of conditions present in vegetated ecosystems.

"The immune system is tightly controlled to acheive the defense against an array of foreign pathogens and to prevent immune-mediated damage to our own cells. Because of their role in regulating immune responses, there has been a considerable interest in the identification of receptors and their ligands that are expressed on lymphocytes and which are necessary to promote their activation, inactivation or elimination. One of the most important receptor-ligand pairs mediating the activation of lymphocytes is CD28 which is expressed on T lymphocytes and B7.2 which is found on cells specialized in the presentation of antigen.  The receptor CTLA-4 also binds B7.2, but is a negative regulator of T lymphocyte functions.  In order to gain a better understanding of the influence of B7.2 on immune responses, we inserted a gene in mice that allows permanent expression of this molecule.  We found that alterations of B7.2 expression have profound and differential effects on the homeostasis and differentiation of the two subsets of T lymphocytes, indicating a substantial role for these molecules in regulating the development and homeostasis of T lymphocytes.  I propose a detailed study which should allow the elucidation of the mechanisms by which these molecules control this important function of the immune system. These studies have important implications for understanding the regulation of T lymphocytes in vivo.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Cell Biology"
"Flower-visiting insects, such as wild bees, bumblebees and the honeybee, provide an essential service to human populations, pollination.  This service is vital to agriculture as more than one third of the global food supply requires the visit of pollinators.  Populations of wild bees have been reported to decline across Europe and North America.  Habitat loss is likely to be one of several factors to contribute to these declines.  Few studies have examined the effects of urban and suburban developments on native bee communities and no studies have explored the movement of wild bees at the interface of urban/suburban and rural areas.  The overall objective of this proposal is to investigate the impacts of urban and suburban landscapes on wild bee conservation and crop pollination.  The specific objectives of this research program are to 1) determine whether wild bee diversity and abundance change across a gradient of development (from urban to natural lands); 2) identify the plant species that support wild bees; 3) determine the effect of urban landscape components, such as ornamentals, turf grass, and non-plant, on the abundance and biodiversity of wild bees in adjacent agricultural fields; and 4) determine whether floral patches located in sub/urban-rural interfaces enhance the movement of wild bees into crops.  The proposed research is novel and will have important implications for urban landscape management, conservation planning, and land-use policies.","Conservation and preservation","Evolution & Ecology"

"Volcanic rocks are formed from magma produced at depths of many 10's of km. The magma is often extremely viscous and gas-rich. The way in which the gas separates and escapes from very viscous magma controls whether eruption is effusive or explosive, in like manner to the way which gas can be un-mixed from the liquid upon opening a  champagne bottle. Viscous magmas cool during their ascent producing a variety of minerals such as quartz and feldspar. Just as Canadians know first hand, and recognize the variety of different crystalline forms that fall as ice from clouds, we know that the minerals of these volcanic systems form different patterns depending upon their conditions of formation. By examination of these mineral patterns we are able to infer some information about the nature of deep processes that led to eruption.

      Accordingly the plan of this research is to dissect several modern high-silica rhyolite systems. It turns out that the one such mineral-texture, spherulites, that heretofore have been considered a result of post-volcanic processes, are in fact closely associated in time and space with the exsolution of the gas phase. We will investigate the details of these crystals and those produced deep during storage phases (phenocrysts) and those produced during ascent to shallow depths (microlites) their organization and relationships to other features. 

      We (students, colleagues and I) will carefully sample appropriate materials from outcrop and core in order to study the minerals patterns by optical microscope and electron backscatter diffraction, and their chemistry by electron microprobe. Analysis of these data will allow us to test various hypotheses about the mineral growth, some of which we will then relate to the magma ascent and eruption processes. Because we expect that there are feedbacks involved in the generation of the patterns and the dynamics, for instance the growth of spherulites and the gas phase from the melt may stimulate each other, we will use non-linear dynamical modeling techniques to better quantify process.

"The polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEM) hold the promise of more energy efficient and cleaner power in the future. The PEM fuel cell is unique in that its electrolyte consists of a layer of solid polymer, which allows protons to be transmitted from one face to the other. It basically requires humidified hydrogen and oxygen (or air) as its inputs. It operates at a temperature much lower than other fuel cells because of the limitations imposed by the thermal properties of the membrane itself, and the requirement to hydrate the membrane (i.e. above 100 degrees C the water will not be a liquid).   Fuel cell performance at the 'beginning of life' is well understood and has been modeled in a number of different manners.  However, two of the most important considerations in an electrical power system are reliability and life, therefore performance at 'end-of-life' is of interest.  The objective of this research is to develop a reliability model for a PEM fuel cell stack and system, and link the failure modes to material degradation phenomenon. Reliability analysis can be regarded as part of the overall study of component effectiveness, specifically defined as the probability that the component can successfully meet operational demand within a given time, when operated under specific conditions.

One of the principal applications of PEM fuel cells will be in hydrogen powered hybrid vehicles. This project will also study design of such systems, and the development of adaptive control systems for hybrid vehicles that accommodate  fuel cell degradation. Performance and control system models will be developed and there will be an attempt to link performance changes to the failure modes and material degradation issues.  

The reliability and performance degradation models can be used to aid in cell, stack and hybrid system design.  Users of fuel cell power systems can use the research in control system development, and life cycle and cost analysis, as well as for maintenance planning.

"My research will focus on the life history and morphological characteristics of two invasive species, the pumpkinseed sunfish and the round goby. I will determine whether introduced populations show particular adaptations in non-native environments, whether such differences can be related to the physical or biological environment, and if they have become part of the genetic makeup of these introduced populations. 



The pumpkinseed was introduced in Europe in the late 1800's, and is considered invasive throughout much of southern Europe.  I will study its reproduction, morphology and genetics across the native and introduced range to identify major differences between native and non-native populations.  I will also conduct experiments with pumpkinseeds of different origins reared in a common environment in order to explain the differences observed in nature. The round goby is recent Eurasian invader that has become a serious problem in Canada. I will compare population and reproductive attributes of gobies where they are well established with those at the edge of their expanding range to determine whether this fish succeeds by changing its life history strategy as it becomes more established. I will determine whether range expansion occurs mainly through the migration of juveniles or adults. 



The proposed pumpkinseed research builds upon 17 years of life history investigations on native and introduced populations, and provides a unique opportunity to explain why aquatic species are successful invaders in some regions and not in others. The goby research would fill in a major gap in our knowledge of the species in its non-native range, and could explain how invasive populations respond to opportunities for expansion.","Inland waters","Evolution & Ecology"

"Prenatal programming of variability in postnatal growth performance in swine as an economically important aspect of ""phenotypic plasticity"".  Lifetime production potential in livestock species is ultimately controlled by the interaction between the highly selected genotype of an animal and its environment.  These environmental factors are operative in both the prenatal and postnatal periods.  It is becoming clear that lifetime growth potential may be limited by key events occurring early in embryonic and fetal development.  Programming of early embryonic development is a complex process that is initially controlled by maternally derived regulators in the cytoplasm of the fertilized oocyte, and is then controlled by the expression of the uniquely reconstituted embryonic genome. However, expression of the embryonic genome is subject to epigenetic (environmental) regulation, mediated by ""imprinted"" genes that are only expressed from either the maternal or the paternal allele.  The mechanism of gene imprinting involves DNA methylation, and there is evidence that this process can be altered by maternal nutrition.  An unequivocal role of ""imprinted genes"" in the regulation of placental development, fetal demand for maternal nutrients and resulting fetal intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), has not been established in the pig.  A primary objective of our NSERC-funded research is to determine the involvement of gene imprinting as a mediator of these epigenetic effects. State-of-the-art applied genomic techniques (gene macro-arrays and candidate gene micro-array analyses) will be used to study effects of different nutritional regimens and lactational catabolism, functional nutrients, and inadvertent intra-uterine crowding on early embryonic survival and pre-natal programming in the broader context of comparative animal developmental biology.  In the context of an important meat producing species like the pig, the regulation of muscle differentiation (myogenesis) will be a particular focus, as a factor limiting postnatal growth performance.","Agriculture and primary food production","Integrative Animal Biology"

"Formal methods in system verification is an important field of theoretical computer science. In my research

project I am particularly interested in formal methods involvement in the context of the safety critical systems.

Such systems are often described as a collection of communicating asynchronous sequential processes. The objective of this proposal is to study methods based on automata and language theory for formal verification of such systems.



The objectives of the proposed research program are the following:

1. Define and study mathematical models for representing asynchronous communicating systems in terms of

collections of tape sharing multi-tape transducers. In such models, sequential processes are seen as relations on words expressible by finite automata. We will study their fundamental properties such as: decidability and complexity of membership problem, equality problem, inclusion problem, various closure properties, etc.

2. Develop an assertion language supporting a hierarchy of abstraction layers. The assertion language will be based on ""simple-functions"" for which there exists a unique representation in terms of canonical ""Concatenation State Machine"". The language will allow the specification (at different levels of abstraction) of local state transformations of sequential processes and represent them by finite automata. Such representation would permit the use of model checking methods in the process of formal verification of the system.

3. Develop a process algebra in order to establish a concise syntax, together with formal mathematical semantics for asynchronous communicating systems. Such a process algebra would constitute the foundation for the development of various proof methods in order, for example, to perform hand-crafted proofs over complex (e.g., infinite state space) systems, for which model checking methods do not apply.

"The mixing operations and related technologies are considered mature in terms of knowledge and science. However, even today, process losses originating from mixing inefficiencies results in billion dollars losses from out-of-specs products, poor selectivity in chemical reactions, undesirable by-products, ... Research in multiphase mixing, a core chemical engineering science allowing for the production of new (nano-) materials and high-performance products, will help increase the Canadian leading position in the engineering field. Alberta currently digs 1.2Mbbl per day and the challenge related to the transportation of this huge quantity cannot be neglected in view of the soaring building costs in Calgary and Edmonton. Adding to this already difficult situation, the production is planned to increase to 2.4 Mbbl/d in 2015. Eastern Canada refineries are currently gearing up to refine extra-heavy oil but the current oil transportation system is still not adequate. Transporting the oil after emulsification is a new technology that offers many advantages but requires additional research. Many emulsion polymerization processes involve the presence of solid particles at the oil-water interface. They also involve emulsion phase inversion that is a crucial step in the final products quality and is often the cause of out-of-spec products. If the agitation of the emulsion has been shown to exert a strong influence on the final product, the solids presence at the interface has not been studied yet and further investigation of the phase inversion in presence of solids will be beneficial to yield improvements and product quality.

This program proposes to explore the production/separation of multiphase emulsions and the required equipment designs to achieve successful processing by means of multi-shaft mixers or multi-function, single shaft mixers, and with static mixers. The proposed research program exploits the applicant's expertise in viscous oil emulsification and phase inversion, solids dispersion, and mixing equipment design.

"Most people tend to view the natural world as constant. Sure, a storm may blow a tree down or a bluff may be slowly eaten away by the waves, but the oceans and the mountains are forever. When people think of forever in this way, they are approaching the concept from a human point of view, limited by our short lifespans. However, the oceans and mountains also have lifespans and these are much longer. Only ten thousand years ago most of Canada was covered by ice. Everything we see today was either not here or, if it was large and solid, was under the ice. The further back in time we go, the more different things were. Two thousand seven hundred million years ago the central area of Canada consisted of volcanic islands similar to the Carribean region; North America did not exist; a world ocean dominated the planet; the most advanced life were bacteria; and the atmosphere had no oxygen, but lots of carbon dioxide. We know this because the rocks that were formed at this time from volcanic eruptions, and the sedimentary rocks produced by the erosion of the islands, occur as bedrock under large areas of central Canada. My research uses clues left behind in sedimentary rocks to discouver what the geography looked like when the Earth was a young planet. I am particularly interested in the composition of the atmosphere and ocean during the time period 2.7 to 1.8 thousand million years ago when photosynthesizing organisms first started to add significant amounts of oxygen to the atmosphere and oceans. I analyse minerals in sedimentary rock that formed from chemicals precipitated in the ocean at that time. These minerals grew on the bottom of the ocean and are now contained in two billion year old sedimentary rocks. The composition of the minerals provides me with the information I need to form conclusions on how the chemistry of the oceans developed through time.

We ride across the universe on a ball of rock tethered to a star. The volcanoes and mountains that shape the surface of our rocky craft originate in the Earth's mantle.  Although the mantle is the Earth's largest resource, ultimately buffering the surface conditions of the planet, our knowledge of it is meager and largely inferential in nature. My research explores the nature of the Earth's mantle, and the processes within it that give rise to basaltic volcanism. My current research revolves around two issues: 



  The cause(s) of the changing Fe and Si contents of the Earth's mantle over time.



  The implications of a new kimberlite model for the tectonics of the lithospheric   

  mantle, the search for diamonds, and possibly the climate of the planet.  



My graduate students and I study the compositional variation in two types of mantle-derived rock: high-Mg basalts and the mantle xenoliths they sometimes carry to the surface. These two rock types represent, respectively, frozen liquids produced by partial melting of the Earth's mantle and actual fragments of refractory mantle.   In the long run, by conducting studies on such rock suites over the age of the Earth, I hope to contribute to our understanding of the temporal evolution of the Earth and the terrestrial planets in general. This research is important not only for the new insights it offers into the origins of the Earth's ancient rocks, but also for our present understanding of the mantles of the terrestrial planets, and for the search for magmatic nickel mineralization and diamonds.

"The process of gene and whole genome duplication is a fundamental mechanism in the evolution of genome and organism complexity.  Genes descending from a duplication event are said to be members of a gene family. The diversity in function of the gene family members is the result of changes in amino acids in the coding region and/or changes in the regulatory domains due to random mutations in the descendant genes.  We are studying the genetic regulation and molecular evolution of the intracellular calcium release channels gene family also known as ryanodine receptors (RyR) in non-mammalian vertebrates.  We have chosen zebrafish as our model system for several reasons. They are hardy, disease resistant and easily reared and have become a well characterized model for studying vertebrate genetics and development.  The zebrafish genome project and recent assembly of sequence data will also permit us to mine for gene sequences. Another distinct advantage of working with fish is the fact that they have discretely compartmentalized muscle fiber types. We have previously shown that fish express fiber type-specific RyR isoforms in skeletal muscle of fish. We are interested in determining the spatial and temporal expression patterns of all members of the RyR gene family in zebrafish.  We will clone the regulatory regions of the zebrafish RyR gene isoforms and determine the essential regions for expression using green fluorescent tagged promoter constructs in microinjected zebrafish embryos. We will also investigate the functional role of RyR genes in development by ""knocking down"" expression by injecting antisense morpholinos into zebrafish embryos. To investigate the molecular evolution of the two-isoform condition in skeletal muscles of fish we will survey the genomic DNA of primitive vertebrate species including coelacanth and hagfish. Comparison of primitive and derived RyR sequences will reveal important information about both the coding and non-coding (regulatory) regions of the genes.","Advancement of knowledge","Molec. & Develop.

"The rise in anthropogenic CO2 may alter future climate and we must improve our predictive capabilities to decide on optimal societal responses. The ocean plays a critical role in regulating Earth's climate by controlling atmospheric CO2 and by redistributing incoming solar heat. The distribution of two natural radioisotopes (230Th and 231Pa) in seawater provides important information on particle dynamics, carbon fluxes and deep-water circulation in the modern ocean, which can be used to better quantify oceanic processes important for climate change. In addition, the incorporation of these isotopes in the sedimentary record provides a means of assessing the temporal evolution of these oceanic processes in relation to past climate changes and provides the needed temporal context to distinguish between climatic trends induced by anthropogenic activities and recurring natural cycles.

I will measure detailed water column profiles of 230Th and 231Pa dissolved in seawater and associated with marine particles in the northeastern and equatorial Pacific which will complement on-going work in the northwestern Atlantic. These profiles will bring quantitative information on ventilation (Atlantic) and upwelling (Pacific) rates of deep water, and on the factors controlling the sinking rates of marine particles and the sequestration of carbon into the deep sea. 

This information will be placed in a larger temporal context using the sedimentary record of 230Th and 231Pa to further document changes in carbon flux and deep-water circulation associated with climatic shifts during the late Quaternary and the Holocene. Atlantic sediments provide insights into past changes in deep water formation and their role in triggering abrupt climate changes (work funded by CFCAS). I will complement this study by integrating the 230Th, 231Pa, and foraminifera Mg/Ca in a multi-PIs, multiproxy study of past changes in the circulation and productivity of the Pacific Ocean.

"PASADO Canada will constitute a significant Canadian participation in the study of paleoclimate and of maar-diatreme formation at Laguna Potrok Aike in the dry steppe of southern Patagonia, Argentina, through access to a ~ 400 m-long sequence cored under the framework of the International Continental Scientific Drilling program. The multidisciplinary Canadian team is composed of 13 researchers from eight institutions and universities across Canada.  The international Potrok Aike Maar Lake Sediment Archive Drilling Project, lead by B. Zolitschka, Univ. Bremen, Germany, has over 60 international collaborators. The main contributions of the Canadian scientists to the larger research program are:

(1) To undertake analysis of a long sediment sequence at low (millennial) resolution from the deep center basin to establish marine - ice core - terrestrial linkages focusing on the magnitude and abruptness of glacial/interglacial transitions, and periodicities of climate variability during glacial and interglacial periods. Results will also allow the evaluation of proxy-based hypotheses with Global Circulation Model climate simulations to establish mechanistic links between climate variability and forcing factors.

(2) To study Marine Isotopic Stages 5e and 11 at high resolution, the best-preserved interglacial known to be warmer than the current Holocene. We will focus our efforts on reconstructing the hydrological conditions (salinity, recurrence and duration of droughts and floods) in high resolution (decadal to centennial).

(3) To analyze the sediments that intersect the volcaniclastic deposits and the country rocks beyond the maar-diatreme wall to study volcanological processes in soft-country rocks, a situation similar to the Canadian Prairies.

Understanding global circulation and how a warmer interglacial affects regional and global drought is of major interest for Canada for the development of policies to mitigate the effect of projected global warming.

The Government of Canada needs to better understand and evaluate what are the current impacts of these changes on aquatic and terrestrial environments and to estimate future conditions. This research aims to look at the fossil record to reconstruct the climate and the environment of the past. These data are used to test and validate the climate models that are used to predict future climate conditions. We look at the sediments that accumulate at the bottom of the arctic lakes and that leave - in favorable situation - a distinct layer for each year. Their analyses with an electron microscope and a scanner that retrieve the chemical composition at high resolution allow to reconstruct the mean temperature or/and the precipitation for each year. We intend to study 2 sites that will potentially enable us to obtain the longest (8000 years), annually resolved records of the High Arctic.

The ICDP is an international organization that promotes the use of scientific drilling as a tool to address a broad range of problems in the Geosciences.  Drilling projects have included studies that range from lake sediment coring to understand climate variations in the Quaternary through hard rock drilling to obtain continuous records of the Paleoproterozoic environmental changes, from sampling of materials from active volcanoes and large faults to rocks damaged by large impacts, and from hydrocarbon gas hydrates to supercritical water geothermal energy sources. ICDP has now supported 28 past or currently active drilling campaigns on 5 continents, including the 2002 Mallik gas hydrate research well in the Mackenzie delta. To date NSERC scientists have been or are currently active in ICDP supported projects in California, China, Ghana, Finland, and Argentina, and are included as key participants in potential ICDP drilling projects in Idaho, Turkey, Norway, and Russia. ICDP directly funded workshops in Wolfville, Mallik and Sudbury. Research themes conducted in the frame of ICDP are of global significance and have the potential for important benefits to the Canadian society and industry. They include themes such as global change, geohazards, CO2 sequestration, energy and mineralogical resources. ICDP projects, workshops and training courses serve as excellent training vehicles exposing students to technical and scientific advancements at high levels, to the full range of the geosciences, and to international level collaborations.  Continuation of Canada's membership to ICDP will allow Canadians to participate in projects around the world, and just as importantly with ICDP involvement to make larger projects on Canadian soil possible in the future. The project also aims to build a strong network of Canadian Earth scientist, to assist the clearinghouse and outreach activities at the CCDP secretariat.

"This research aims to look at the fossil record to reconstruct the climate and the environment of the past from desertic environments. These data are necessary to test and validate the climate models that are used to predict future climate conditions. We look at sediments that accumulate at the bottom of lakes and that leave - in favorable situation - a distinct layer for each year: one varve. Their analyses with an electron microscope and a micro X-Ray fluorescence scanner that retrieve the chemical composition at high resolution allow to reconstruct the mean temperature or/and the precipitation for each year. We intend to study three varved lakes in the Canadian High Arctic that will potentially enable us to obtain the longest (8000 years), annually resolved records from this area. It will enable us to address questions such as ""What are the frequencies of extreme events, and is their recurrence increasing in a warming planet?"" and ""What are the main modes of variability of the climate system, and how have these modes of variability been affected by human activities?"". We also intend to study Lake Yoa in Chad, one of very few lakes in the Sahara that have been protected against desiccation by continuous groundwater inflow. This site has the potential to provide a well-dated paleoenvironmental frame for the migration of nomadic population to the Nile valley and the rise of the Egyptian civilization. Finally, this research aims at developing and improving existing methodologies for the analysis of varve sediments.

"The objective of the proposed research is to model and experimentally investigate high-speed microelectronics for microwave and millimeter wave communication systems using complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processes, commonly used for digital circuits. Since circuit fabrication costs in CMOS can be significantly lower than most of the traditional microwave technologies, they offer significant competitive advantages to manufacturers. This emerging area of research has applications for both wireless and  photonic systems. 

Three primary thrusts are proposed. Firstly, the project will develop and test novel high speed planar inductive interconnects between planar off-chip antennas and CMOS electronics. The integration of antennas with silicon circuits is a very challenging problem, as traditional low-resistivity silicon substrates significantly degrade the efficiency of antennas when in close proximity. 

The second major thrust is the development of low-loss inductive elements for CMOS low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, and voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs). The loss of traditional passive elements significantly degrade performance of CMOS circuits at these frequencies.

The third major thrust is the completion of a completely integrated differential CMOS front-end at 24 GHz using an inexpensive 0.18 um process. Using techniques developed in the first two thrusts, the performance of a differential receiver consisting of an integrated antenna with an LNA, mixer, and voltage controlled oscillator will be assessed.

This project proposes to develop techniques that enable the development of compact, low cost communication systems at high data rates.

"The control of upright standing is a basic requirement of much of our daily activity. The long term goal of my research is to understand the organization of postural control strategies under different task and environmental challenges. A strategy defines the relative importance of visual, kinesthetic and vestibular sensory inputs for detecting changes in stability and the relative contribution of forces generated my muscles and joints of the limbs and trunk to maintain or recover stability. To date we have little insight to how postural control strategies are reorganized when we attempt to learn a new balance task. 

This research focuses on how we learn to stabilize the large mass of the head and trunk when challenged by ongoing and often, unpredictable forces that arise from the environment (external perturbations) and our own movements (self-imposed perturbations). We encounter such challenges on a regular basis when walking, but are reminded of the difficulty only when navigating uneven terrain or suffering a balance impairment. Experimentally, these perturbations will be delivered by continuous, oscillating translations or rotations of a platform on which participant stands; motion of the platform is driven by a motor during external perturbations and by participant movements during self-imposed perturbations. Another series of experiments examines the control of balance when walking with variable-amplitude steps, as might occur when walking on uneven ground. All of these experiments will use biomechanical analyses to characterize changes in the patterns of muscle activation, joint forces and body movements that accompany practice of the balance task. My previous research has revealed that participants adopt a multi-segmental, generalized postural control strategy when learning to stabilize on a continuously moving platform (external perturbations). The planned research will expand these investigations to self-imposed perturbations and walking. Lessons learned from this research will provide insight to the design of rehabilitation programs that can guide the relearning of balance control and restore functional independence in people suffering from impaired balance.

"Marine biodiversity, particularly patterns of fish diversity and the processes that maintain or change diversity at both the population and community level continue to be focal points of my current research. This has led to an examination of the consequences of changing diversity on ecosystem structure and function. The primary drivers of changing diversity in the continental shelf ecosystems under investigation are i) fishing effects, whose scale and magnitude (both direct and indirect) has increased dramatically in recent decades and ii) climate variability. Our recent research has revealed that depletion of large predators can cause a restructuring of some large, open-ocean systems through cascading trophic interactions, extending to the base of chain and altering primary production and nutrient cycling. Planned research on fish species diversity at the community level is based on one of the cornerstones of modern ecological science and conservation biology - the species area relationship or SAR. I intend to use this relationship for understanding how marine fish communities are organized and for determining if conservation protocols that follow from it are practicable and can be justified. The former thrust will involve a determination of the ecological basis for the existence of SAR. This will involve an assessment of the relative influence of habitat diversity, resource concentration and area per se, as described in the equilibrium theory of island biogeography, as the processes shaping the empirical relationship. The latter, more applied thrust involves prediction of species losses from habitat losses, systematic evaluation of the slope of SAR from areas subjected to varying exploitation regimes, and determining whether or not bigger really is better for maintenance of biodiversity, in terms of reserve design. I continue to make use of monitoring data obtained from standardized research surveys conducted by government agencies across the Northwest Atlantic. The surveys, based on consistent sampling methodology, have yielded detailed time series of variation in abundance, spatial distribution and species diversity across multiple trophic levels at broad spatial (100-1000+ kms) and temporal scales (most established and maintained since early 1970s).

"The next 5-10 years are expected to be very exciting for particle physics. The only experimentally confirmed model for particle interactions, the Standard Model, contains some fundamental theoretical inconsistencies. Physicists have constructed several alternative models, but these have not yet had the chance of being tested. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN and the International Linear Collider (ILC) are likely to change all that, with the LHC expected to start taking data in 2007. However, if the data produced turns out to be inconsistent with that predicted by the Standard Model, an important question will be: which one of the scenarios beyond the Standard Model is the one consistent with the experimental signals. I propose to investigate this question, focusing mostly on a model that we developed at Concordia, which incorporates supersymmetry (a fermion-boson symmetry) and left-right (mirror, or parity) symmetry into the Standard Model. I plan to concentrate on the most promising signs for this model, and disentangle these from signals obtained in other models. Thus, at the same time, I will be looking at other possible models as well. Some of my studies will involve comparing the data obtained at the LHC with signals at the ILC, where the background signals are less complicated, and where this particular model could provide more definite events, some of which would be rather spectacular. This project represents a continuation of my interest in this specific model and its distinguishing signs at colliders.  I propose to start in a systematic way and draw a clear picture of what the model predicts consistently, then move on to search for possible deviations from the better known, and more widely explored, models. I work with my group at Concordia (graduate students and one postdoctoral fellow), but I also collaborate with groups in Israel, Europe and the US.

"Spintronics (""spin-based electronics"" or magnetoelectronics) is an emergent technology that exploits both the charge and spin of an electron rather than utilizing charge as the sole basis for microelectronic devices. Spintronic devices are expected to be smaller, more versatile, and more robust than currently available silicon-based circuits.  An emerging example is magnetic random access memory (MRAM) which is ""non volatile"" - no information is lost when the system power is turned off.  A current estimate of the potential MRAM market is in excess of $100 billion annually.  More distant applications exploit combinations of semiconductor, magnetic, and optical materials that may lead to ultra-fast switches, and ""all spintronic"" processors that would combine storage, processing, and communication on a single chip.

    )	In order to design spintronic materials, it is critical that we understand how to control charge, spin, and excited state processes in materials in which more than one process exists. The goals of our research program are to develop models for the synergy between magnetic, conducting and optical phenomena in molecular materials through design, synthesis and development of structure-function relationships. We have developed synthetic methodology for two novel classes of dual-function molecular materials; magneto-conducting materials comprised of conjugated pi systems incorporating stable radicals, and magneto-optical materials comprised of coordination compounds incorporating photochromic ligands. Each subclass exhibits the desired properties of spin, charge and optical tunability. We will build on these systems to synthesize and investigate the physical properties of dual function materials in which magnetic bistability, redox bistability, and optical bistability are incorporated. In these systems, we will have the ability to modify magnetic properties (spin state) with an external stimulus: charge or light. Investigation of these materials may lead to unprecedented functionalities and new theories for understanding critical physical processes in magnetoelectronic materials.

"It is a fundamental principle of psychological theory that behaviour is guided by memories - memories of things that happened and how we felt about them, memories of where we find the things we need, memories of what relates to what, and memories of how we do things like ride a bicycle or drive car. Not all memories are helpful to us, memories of traumatic events or memories of  euphoric drug effects are thought to maintain pathological states such as panic disorder or drug abuse.  Contemporary theories of memory hold that memories are stored in biochemical and structural changes in the connections between the cells that participate in the perception of the remembered events. These changes were thought to be relatively permanent but more recently it has been suggested that when memories are re-activated the structural basis becomes temporarily plastic and memories can be altered or disrupted by treatments that interfere with the biochemical mechanisms of memory storage. It is not known whether this applies to all types of memory, or whether the disruption is permanent or not. We have evidence in rats that the memories of drug effects that are thought drive morphine addiction can be disrupted by memory-blocking drugs applied around the time a non-dependent animal expresses his motivation for the drug. However this effect seems to be temporary and is overcome by a new experience of the drug. Also when the animal is dependent the memories appear to be resistant to disruption. The aim of this project is to explore whether changing the dose, using more than one blocking drug or changing the timing of application of the memory blocking drug will improve the amnesia and make it permanent. At the same time we will probe whether the memory is truly lost or just suppressed. We will also examine anatomical markers for the biochemical changes that indicate memory in the brain to see if we can track the loss of the memory induced by memory blocking drugs.

"Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a relatively new remote sensing tool - one which can provide detailed observations of environmental change, biophysical properties, topography, and disturbance processes related to environmental functioning and human-alteration patterns. Environmental scientists and managers need better ways of using these remotely-sensed data; my research program is focussed on this idea of combining airborne LiDAR data with multispectral imagery to create information products that can be used to understand and manage the processes driving environmental change in Canada and worldwide. This work is a fine balance between remote sensing applications-driven research and technology-driven methods development; both are needed to make possible fundamental insights in several environmental earth science disciplines (geomorphology, hydrology, landscape ecology, forest science). New challenges include the development of fusion and texture procedures, and the creation of image analysis methods to estimate geomorphometrics and forest structure, their changes over time, and their likely status (i.e. prediction). This information is necessary to understand processes such as geomorphic controls on landscape evolution (e.g., sediment budget), forest structure and productivity, and a wide variety of environmental management applications that cross geological, ecological, topographical, and all geographical boundaries (e.g., biodiversity). First, there must be fundamental improvements in our knowledge of how image spectral and texture patterns are influenced by human and natural disturbances such as landslides and forest management practices. In continuing this work, I will contribute to the solution of environmental problems, such as natural hazard assessment, by adding to the accumulation of necessary environmental knowledge in key Canadian landscapes. Anyone working with remote sensing in boreal and mountain landscapes, anyone with a large area environmental management issue or problem requiring scientific observations of reflectance, topography, biophysical functioning, ecological indicator, will benefit with access to my results and methods.

"Distributed computing systems are becoming increasingly important for information access and for administration as organizations in education, health, government, and business move into networks of interacting computers.  Constructing performance models of these systems has shown to be beneficial during all stages of a project. For example, a model can be used to set performance budgets for components of a system.  The model can also be used to find feasible designs and locate potential bottlenecks.  Finally, the model can be used to plan the resources required for installed systems.  In all of these case cases, the use of models can lead to substantial cost savings for a performance-sensitive project.



The major problem impeding the use of performance models is the actual generation of the models themselves.  The architecture of the system being studied must be extracted and the resource requirements of the components in the system must be specified.  Getting this information can be time consuming and difficult.



The purpose of this project is to simplify the entire model building, solution and analysis process.  Performance models will be created automatically based on the automatic instrumentation and tracing of pre-existing software.  The user need only to execute her software, possibly as part of normal system testing, to generate the performance model.  



The instrumentation and tracing will be driven by high-level design models where possible because the design model can provide hints on how to filter and translate the event logs generated by the system under test.  Further, measurement results from tracing will be imported back into the design models.   Performance modeling will then be moved out of the realm of experts and into everyday use.

"Picture two very different but real life scenarios. In the first a policeman in a patrol car pulls over a suspected stolen vehicle. The officer draws his gun and walks over to the driver side of the stolen vehicle. As he approaches the driver a car that is driving behind the policeman ""backfires"". The officer discharges his weapon into the stolen vehicle injuring the suspect. Did the officer intentionally fire his gun at the suspect? In the second scenario an Olympic track and field 100m final is underway and the world record holder is ""under starter's orders"" after having false started once before. The starter pistol is fired and the athlete ""explodes"" out of the blocks for what most believe to be a good start. However, he has produced an increase in force that is recorded on the ""starting blocks"" 96 ms after the starter pistol fired. The International Association of Athletics Federation state that any athlete increasing force on the ""blocks"" before 100 ms has passed after the starter signal must have ""jumped the gun"". Therefore the athlete was disqualified. Did the athlete intentionally anticipate the start  without waiting for the sound of the starter pistol? Are these two scenarios related and can the actions of both the policeman and the athlete be explained? It is clear that fast responses to everyday stimuli are required of people on a daily basis and these movements have long been thought to be controlled via information flow through higher brain centres (cortical loops). However, we have recently shown (along with others) that when the prepared response is ready to go the loud signal has the effect of startling the individual causing the entire response to be released, in some instances without the subject being aware that the response has occurred. We have observed reaction times to unanticipated startling stimuli as low as 65 ms. Our hypothesis is that a prepared response is pre-programmed and stored in lower (subcortical) brain structures. When the signal arrives the response is triggered early by the startling sound, bypassing cortical processing and resulting in short reaction times. The programme of research that I propose will investigate the processes responsible for such fast prepared actions and shed light on their preparation, storage and execution.

"The aim of this project is to investigate the topology of spaces with an action of a torus T=(S^1)^n, the n-fold Cartesian product of a circle. The focus will be on spaces with rich additional structure arising in various fields, e.g., Hamiltonian T-manifolds (symplectic geometry) or toric varieties (algebraic geometry). This is motivated by the fact that algebraic topology, in particular equivariant cohomology, often plays a crucial role in applications of these spaces, for instance to representation theory and combinatorics.



We will focus on results which permit actual calculations and are therefore easy to apply to other areas. We will also study invariants of toric spaces, in particular of singular ones, defined in various categories and explore their differences as well as their combinatorial significance. Another objective is to understand the geometric origin of deformations of these invariants.



Mathematical software has become an indispensable tool to study examples. We will develop new programs and combine them with existing ones in order to tackle problems which are currently out of reach. Porting my powerful Maple package ""convex"" to a popular open-source system like SAGE will also be explored.



As a guiding line, we will evaluate our results and tools against important open problems such as Halperin's ""toral rank conjecture"".

"This proposal is to add one independent fish rack housing system to our fish facility.  We currently have two racks, one housing zebrafish and one housing the Mexican tetra.  Both fish species are used extensively in my research which investigates skeletal development and variation.  The tetra is a unique model organism in that it exists naturally as two morphs, one is blind (with eyes) and one is sighted (without eyes).   Our tetra rack is full to capacity, largely due to these fish being aggressive at body lengths greater than 1 cm.  In addition, the two morphs need to be kept apart for breeding purposes otherwise they will inter-breed. This proposal is to add one rack with 5 shelves, and 51 small (two to six litre) tanks.  These tanks will be used to raise juveniles prior to collecting specimens for bone development analyses and to keep surgery (one-eyed) fish apart from normal (two-eyed) fish.  Our existing tetra rack with 18 large (twelve litre) tanks will then be used to house our breeding stocks.  At present we have 75 tetra fish and only 18 tanks.

"My broad interest is in comparative vertebrate development and evolution.  Specifically I am interested in how the head skeleton of vertebrates has changed over the course of evolution.  I therefore study a very important population of cells, called the neural crest cells, which migrates from the developing brain to become the bones and cartilages of the head; ultimately producing the incredibly diverse skulls seen today.  My focus is on part of the skeleton situated within the eye (namely, scleral ossicles and scleral cartilage) and how development of the eye contributes to shaping the vertebrate skull.  I compare the development and morphology (shape) of the ocular skeleton in different vertebrates, primarily in birds and fish.  The use of fish as a model will provide important alternative perspectives to understanding skeletal biology, compared to those obtained from more traditional model organisms, such as mammals (mice, rats) and birds (chicken).  One of the other fish species I use in my research is the Mexican tetra, which exists as two forms (morphs) of one species; one blind, one sighted.  This difference within a single species allows me to explore the tissue interactions between the developing eye and surrounding skeleton; two systems that are usually the focus of independent studies.  For an evolutionary perspective, I also study the skulls of fossil vertebrates to assess the homology of skeletal elements, to understand evolutionary trajectories and to attempt to infer developmental processes that took place millions of years ago.  



Ultimately, I am interested in understanding how neural crest cells develop (differentiate), how tissues (bone and cartilage) are patterned and how morphological (shape) variations emerge.  The proposed research program has a multi-faceted and comparative approach; it will contribute to our understanding of skeletal biology, organismal biology and mechanisms of evolution.

"Information systems (IS) are prevalent in today's economy.  A typical example of IS, and probably the most important one, is the Enterprise Resource Planning system (ERP), with its 18 billion $ worldwide market.  To manage costs, enterprises are buying COTS (commercial of the shelf) IS like ERPs, but that forces them to adapt their business process to the COTS, reducing their flexibility and ability to develop innovative business strategies, and locking them with a single vendor with little bargaining power for controlling maintenance costs.  This proposal aims at providing a more flexible way of designing IS that better match the rapidly evolving environment that organisations are facing.  We want to build on the platform that we have developed over the past five years, called APIS, and extend its capabilities for building an IS, from the user interface to services and databases.  There are three axes we want to address: reuse, validation and instrumentation.  Reuse is a key productivity and quality issue in IS building.  For instance, Hertz's car rental system is probably very similar to Budget's, but not exactly the same.  We want to study reuse mechanisms at the specification level, so that one can build a generic specification, e.g., for a car rental system, and instantiate it and tailor it for a specific enterprise environment, while preserving the properties and the capabilities specified at the generic level.  The APIS platform eliminates most of the need for design and implementation, which means that unit, integration and system testing are also eliminated.  However, there is still a need to perform validation and acceptance testing, to make sure that the system specification is the appropriate one, that it satisfies business requirements.  This can be done manually, by designing tests scenarios.  We could go a step further by using modern verification technology, either by using theorem proving or model checking.

"All of biology is regulated by genes - they are the code that determines what each organism looks like and how it functions.  To evolve a new structure like a brain or a thumb needs the evolution of new gene functions - how does this happen?  Does evolution use the same old genes in new ways, much as one might build many different structures using the same building blocks? Or do new structures tend to need new building blocks, just as building a toy car needs us to have parts for wheels? These are key questions at the heart of our understanding of biology and evolution.



One of the great advances in the last decade has been our ability to look at the functions of genes in a truly systematic manner and this has given great insights into the evolution of gene function.  We know, for example, that animals as different as yeast, worms and flies use the same basic machineries - if a gene is needed for yeast to live, the same gene is needed for worms and flies to survive as well.  However, comparing how genes work in yeast and worms and flies has problems - these animals are hugely different biologically, and this greatly limits the comparisons we can do.  What we propose here is to look at how genes work in three nematode worms that have very similar bodies and behaviours, but have evolved separately for almost 100 million years.  Using a new technique called RNA-mediated interference (RNAi), we have already identified every single gene with an identifiable function in one of these three worms.  We can now use RNAi in the other two worms to ask: do they do the same things in the other related worms? If not - why is this? This project will combine cutting edge approaches including systematic RNAi screens and new sequencing technologies to investigate a fundamental problem in evolution.

"Human impacts on the environment have reduced the number of individuals within many wild species to very low levels. This is a concern to conservation biologists because species with small numbers may have an increased chance of going extinct. For example, small populations often exhibit low levels of genetic diversity, which is thought to reduce the likelihood that at least some individuals in such populations will survive and reproduce if the environment changes, what scientists refer to as reduced adaptability. Is there much evidence in nature of reduced adaptability in small populations? To date, it turns out that this has not been sufficiently studied to generalize, but it is important for society to know because it influences how we approach several conservation efforts to protect the environment and different species in the face of further human development. My proposed research program will examine relationships between population size, genetic diversity and adaptability in a salmonid fish species (brook charr) that is important to many commercial, recreational and aboriginal subsistence fisheries. Specifically, across multiple watersheds, I will determine whether small populations of brook charr do in fact exhibit reduced genetic diversity and adaptability relative to large populations. Field and laboratory studies will be carried out to understand (i) what environmental factors influence adaptability in natural populations of varying size, and (ii) how well small populations respond to environmental changes relative to large populations under conditions that will likely arise with future climate warming. For management agencies of several socio-economically important fish species across Canada, and for the international conservation community, my research will contribute significant new knowledge towards addressing several key environmental issues: (i) how large nature reserves should be to maintain viable populations of different species; (ii) whether small, isolated populations should receive a high priority for conservation; and (iii) how specific populations might respond to future environmental change (e.g. climate warming).

"Optical pulses with extremely short durations (less than a millionth millionth of a second) allow dynamics to be observed on fast time scales inaccessible to other techniques.  Since the energy of the ""ultrafast"" pulse is compressed into a short time, high peak intensities can be achieved, making possible extreme interactions between light and matter.  With the newly completed Queen's ultrafast laser infrastructure, we are probing and controlling condensed matter systems on the micro and nanoscale targeting three application areas. 

NANOSTRUCTURE  DYNAMICS   Carbon nanotubes show exceptional potential for a variety of photonic applications due to their essentially one-dimensional nature.  Past studies of nanotubes have been conducted mostly on large groups of different tubes, making results difficult to interpret.  To determine the intrinsic properties of the nanotube, we control and monitor a single isolated nanotube, following its ultrafast dynamics. Our results will provide a window into the ultrasmall and ultrafast properties of this interesting quantum confined structure, and help evaluate the potential of the carbon nanotube as a building block for future photonic applications.

3D IMAGING   Optical coherence tomography is an interferometric technique that provides full 3D microscopic images with near cellular resolution.  To improve imaging contrast and speed, we use nonlinear optical mixing to isolate the light from deep interfaces.  This proof of principle demonstration will be optimized and implemented in fiber to fully exploit its potential for medical imaging.

MICROMACHINING   Ultrafast pulses can achieve peak intensities so high that they cut materials like steel by ablation.  We have implemented an interferometric imaging system capable of high speed in situ imaging of the ultrafast machining process using the very laser light that provides ablation.  We will use our unique capabilities to help better understand ultrafast optical ablation, and improve industrial processing through active feedback.

We study an enzyme by growing crystals of it similar to crystals of salt in a salt shaker or a diamond.  Using our crystals, we are able to get pictures of the enzyme with the molecules it works on and from looking at these pictures, we get ideas of how the enzyme works.  We test our ideas by changing the structure of the enzyme and discovering whether it still works.

     The enzyme that we are investigating is called succinyl-CoA synthetase.  The reaction forming succinyl-CoA uses three molecules: nucleotide triphosphate, succinate and coenzyme A (CoA).  From these, the enzyme makes phosphate and nucleotide diphosphate in addition to succinyl-CoA.  We would like to discover how the enzyme is able to bind these very different molecules.  So far, we have pictures of the enzyme with CoA, with nucleotide diphosphate and with nucleotide triphosphate.  The places on the enzyme where CoA binds and where the nucleotides bind are far apart.  Near the CoA, there is a residue of the enzyme that gets phosphorylated during the reaction and this residue is at the tip of a loop of the enzyme.  Our idea is that the enzyme swings this loop to shuttle the phosphoryl group between the two binding sites.  In this way, the enzyme is able to connect what is happening at one site to what happens at the other.  It is able to use two separate binding sites for the molecules it acts on.  This may be a general mechanism for enzymes that have to bind three substrates and release three products.  Our research will contribute to the basic understanding of enzymes and how they work.

     Recently, a research group identified children who suffered from a disease because they had a faulty form of succinyl-CoA synthetase.  We know that this enzyme is important for the cells in our body to have enough energy, but gaining a better understanding of how succinyl-CoA synthetase works could help in the discovery of the connection between the enzyme and this disease.

"Just as the automotive industry previously replaced steel and iron prototypes with virtual models, it is now moving electronics and software development to a virtual environment.  Accelerated development cycles and compliance with stringent regulatory requirements are driving the increased use of models during the design and realization process.



The overall objective of this project is to produce the next generation of powertrain modelling, simulation, and control tools geared towards more rapid, accurate, and cost effective vehicle prototyping with a focus on integrating alternative fuel hybrid powertrains into vehicles.  The underlying approach will be to use software-in-the-loop (SIL), hardware-in-the-loop (HIL), and component-in-the-loop (CIL) prototyping and testing.  Specific expected contributions include the introduction of schemes to provide rapid feedback from SIL, HIL, and CIL determined control strategies to the powertrain designers in order to improve powertrain component selection; determining of the feasibility of including uncertainty metrics as a standard output component of SIL, HIL, and CIL results; contributing to a national powertrain simulation network; hopefully better integrating life-cycle considerations into the vehicle powertrain design process; and training students in state-of-the-art SIL, HIL, and CIL prototyping.



Finally, this work facilitates the continued expansion of vehicle powertrain simulation capabilities in Canada thus providing a foundation for the continued ability of Canada to remain an important player in determining the type of vehicles driven on our roads.

"Emotions are part of human behaviour. Our previous work has highlighted the importance of emotions in learning particularly for memorizing information and problem solving. The general objectives of our research are:

(1) to determine the range of emotions which can be played by a virtual tutor   (avatar for instance) with a behaviour similar to a human tutor

(2) to analyze how emotional communications can have an influence on learning performances according the student profile

(3) to determine the emotional conditions which allow for the best transfer of knowledge into subconscious memory.

More precisely we wish to:

- build an emotional agent (emotional tutor) able to detect learner's emotions and communicate with the learner through emotional reactions,

- control and influence learner emotional state in order to optimize the transfer of knowledge,

- adapt the tutoring discourse so that the learner be in optimal emotional conditions of learning,

- continue our preliminary work on subliminal learning which allows the transfer of large quantities of knowledge, information and procedure, into subconscious memory,

- understand and experiment the influence of emotions on subliminal learning.

The impact of these works on learning should be significant : they should allow to

- finally better understand how the brain functions which can have an impact on various applications(education, health, social works) in which the human emotional state can be controlled and optimized to increase memorization and problem solving.

"Advanced Signal Processing for Rapid Imaging



This research program seeks to develop, extend and evaluate advanced algorithms for rapid image acquisition and reconstruction. We are in particular interested in developing new rapid magnetic resonance (MR)-based imaging techniques. We also recognize other applications of the proposed approaches in diverse fields, including geoscience and astronomy. 

   MR is a convenient experimental paradigm since it has the somewhat unique property that both acquisition and reconstruction processes can be highly linear. This allows us to acquire and reconstruct high-quality images against which we can compare our rapidly acquired and reconstructed images.

   Over the past few years, my research group has worked to understand and apply exciting new non-linear image acquisition and reconstruction approaches. These methodologies have the potential to speed up imaging by a factor of 10 or more. To date, we have had much success with specific sparse data sampling strategies and specific non-linear reconstruction approaches, derived from the projection-onto-convex sets methodology. 

   In this project, we will continue our investigations of the coupling between acquisition and reconstruction. Specifically, we will focus on methods for acquiring and reconstructing only the ""essential"" image data. This will lead to greater savings in acquisition time without affecting overall image quality.

"The large-scale processes governing the evolution of the Earth's surface and its deep interior are fundamentally different: the crust undergoes plate tectonics, while the mantle overturns through thermal convection. My proposed research program will examine how these two processes are coupled, particularly in the case of thick continental plates. The continental lithosphere, a ca. 250 km thick layer of mantle material, participates in plate-tectonic motions, but is also eroded by thermal plumes arising from the deep mantle. I propose to examine the lithosphere beneath the Canadian Shield for both crustal and mantle influences, using passive seismic imaging techniques. These techniques involve recording seismic waves produced by earthquakes at networks of seismometers deployed over the study area, and then mathematically reconstructing the properties of the material through which the waves were transmitted. My planned field experiments will be focused on Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and western Ontario, and will target the edge of the ancient Superior continent, the former Trans-Hudson mountain belt lying beneath Saskatchewan, and a billion-year-old rift zone underlying Lake Superior. For all of these structures, I intend to examine the extent to which the geology of the crust is reflected within the lithosphere below. I will also contribute to the development of new methods for producing images of Earth structure from seismic waves: in particular, the use of seismic noise recordings in structural imaging, and the use of scattered and deflected waves travelling along the Earth's surface. This work will contribute to a better understanding of the forces acting on continental plates, along with the deformation history of these plates. I thereby expect to help establish a framework for understanding the large-scale processes that have preserved or deformed ancient continental crust, and the specific history and dynamics of the Canadian Shield. As the lithosphere beneath ancient shield regions is known to be a source region for diamonds, better images of the lithosphere beneath the Canadian Shield will also assist in future diamond exploration.

"Interest often lies in studying processes in which some events can be generated repeatedly over time; such events are called recurrent events. They arise in fields such as medicine and public health, reliability, business, and insurance. The literature on the analysis of recurrent events has grown rapidly over the past twenty years and a lot of methods have been developed. Over the next 5 years, I will work on different prediction and estimation problems involving recurrent events. This research program is divided in three parts: the improvement of prediction models involving recurrent events, the estimation of mean gap/sojourn times from aggregated data, and methods for sample size determination in hierarchical Poisson regression models.

"There were two primary subjects that have been historically been by-passed in textbooks on classical soil mechanics; namely, the behavior of unsaturated soils and the quantification of moisture flux conditions at ground surface. The last 40 years have witnessed rapid strides in our understanding of unsaturated soil mechanics as it applies to relatively homogeneous continua. There are; however, two aspects of unsaturated soil mechanics that stand in great need of further research. The first aspect involves the structural characterization of the soil conditions near ground surface. Often these soils contain extensive fissures, fractures and cracks that significantly affect the unsaturated soil properties. It is proposed that the secondary macrostructure of these soils be characterized through use of bimodal mathematical functions. It is proposed that there be one air entry value associated with the macrostructures features and another air entry value associated with the intact matrix of the soil. The unsaturated soils near to the ground surface thus become bimodal, nonlinear and hysteretic. Many of these soils also exhibit significant volume change during wetting and drying. The second aspect of unsaturated soil mechanics in need of research is the quantification of moisture flow conditions at the ground surface. Both the infiltration of water and the exfiltration during evaporation (as well as evapotranspiration) are subject areas of great interest to practicing geotechnical engineers. These conditions are closely related to our understanding of the impact of climate change. It is through the ability to mathematically quantify water balance conditions at the ground surface that the effects of climate change can be taken into consideration through numerical modeling studies. In my estimation, the characterization of fissured, fractured and cracked soil masses near the ground surface, and the quantification of ground surface moisture flux conditions are two of the main topics requiring further research in unsaturated soil mechanics.","Materials performance","Civil Engineering - A"

"Invasive species are plants and animals that are introduced to regions outside their natural range, and subsequently spread out and dominate native habitats.  Because they are a major threat to biodiversity, and can also greatly reduce agricultural productivity, billions of dollars are spent each year fighting invaders.  However, we cannot successfully repel invaders until we have a better understanding of just what makes some introduced species invasive while others remain stable.  With this goal in mind, I am concentrating on the common reed (Phragmites australis), a species that is well known for the reed beds that it forms in freshwater sites round the world including North America and Europe.  In both continents, native reed populations have been stable for thousands of years, but this all changed in North America more than a century ago when a European strain of the common reed was introduced.  This strain is now invasive in North America, where populations are spreading rapidly and taking over estuaries, lakes, ponds, streams, and other habitats that were previously home to a wide range of species.  Invasive reeds are now such a problem that they have been identified as one of the most destructive plants in Canadian natural habitats.  

I aim to find out just why it is that reed populations that remain stable in their native range become invasive and destructive when they move to new regions.  I will do this through a detailed analysis of the ecology of both invasive and stable reed populations, paying particular attention to whether the invasive strain can tolerate a much broader range of habitats in North America compared to its native Europe.  I will then investigate whether movement of invasive reeds across North America has been accompanied by genetic changes within populations that allow reeds to become better adapted to their new environments.  This direct comparison of reeds in their native and invaded habitats, combined with a search for adaptive genes, will help us to better understand invasions and therefore target future potential invaders.

"The goal is to make an automatic speech recognizer that behaves more like the way people hear speech.  Partly, this is done by forming groups of words that share a common feature, such as one sound in the word, so that whole groups can be tested at once based on this common feature.  The way the sound is measured is also related more directly to movements of the mouth when people speak.  Different measuring units are used for different types of sound, for example, vowels versus consonants.  Since sounds occur in a different order in different words, this means that there may be different measuring units applied in a different order.  Most speech recognizers use a common measuring unit for all sounds in all words so that interpretting the measurements is simpler but some distinctions between sounds might not show up as well.  The grouping of words can also be based on other things, such as the way syllables are stressed or the part of grammar that describes the word, for example, a noun versus a verb.  The desired outcome is to make it much easier to adapt the recognizer to different people or to different words in a vocabulary and possibly to reduce the number of mistakes made in recognition.  Normally, the user must train a speech recognizer by reading out loud from a long story that contains examples of many different words.  The proposed system should require much less of this training.

"Loss of the biomechanical integrity of the skeleton due to fracture or loss of bone tissue often leads to premature disability and leaves the patient with a reduced quality of life. The economic burden on the health care system of skeletal conditions such as osteoporosis-related fractures, osteolytic bone loss and other bone defects related to trauma, bone tumors and surgical resections is enormous. Despite considerable research efforts in implant design, augmentation methods and regenerative medicine approaches, the surgical treatment of the bone deficient skeleton remains challenging with unsatisfactionary clinical outcomes. 

The goal of the research described in this proposal is to develop and evaluate novel implants that i) enhance the fixation of bone screws in low quality bone and ii)""smart"" adaptive implants that ensure appropriate loading of healing bone to ensure an optimal biomechanical environment for fracture repair and bone regeneration. 

A novel bone screw anchor based on an expandable helix, will be developed and evaluated for different areas of screw fixation in orthopaedic surgery. The helix has a matched pitch and inner diameter to the bone screw such that the bone screw can be screwed into the helix like a bolt into a nut. In addition, novel ""smart"" adaptive implants will be developed to optimize the load sharing between implants by combining absorbable biomaterials and metallic implant materials. Implant concepts will be developed using finite element, models and their efficacy and safety will be evaluated in human cadeveric and animal models.

In summary, the proposed research will result in new innovative surgical implants that will substantially increase the success rate of fracture treatment and bone regeneration. These novel implants will be integrated into a multidisciplinary treatment strategy for an effective management and also will foster exiting interdisciplinary collaboration that reveal new opportunities to treat the bone deficient skeleton and ultimately enhance the quality of live of patients and reduce the social and economic burden of these diseases on society.","Biomedical engineering","Mechanical Engineering - A"

"The long-term objective of my research program is to model interactions between physical and chemical factors and lower food web processes in the St. Lawrence River (SLR). Identifying the primary sources of carbon supporting food webs is a fundamental step towards understanding the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems. Some studies have argued for a dominant role of terrestrial carbon and heterotrophy in river food webs while others have stressed the greater importance of in situ photosynthetic sources. In either case, the transported matter in the river is transformed by light or bacterial activity which affects its bioavailability and flow to downstream consumers. This study aims at understanding how the transfer of matter (e.g. nutrients, phytoplankton) and organisms between habitats (connectivity) is controlling food availability and biodiversity, important for determining carbon sources supporting food webs and productivity in large river ecosystems. Lac St. Pierre (LSP) is the largest fluvial lake (~400 km2) of the SLR and is well recognized for its high productivity. However, there is a large gap in knowledge about the fate of matter leaving LSP into the fluvial estuary, which connects to the estuarine transition zone (ETZ). The ETZ is light-limiting for photosynthesis and marks where freshwater meets saltwater. It is recognized for its very high productivity, and as a large nursery area for several fish species. I hypothesize that much of the productivity in the ETZ is dependent on transported material from the fluvial estuary, which in turn receives high dissolved organic matter and nutrients from LSP. I recently established that LSP can contribute significantly to downstream productivity through large populations of ice-algae drifting during the ice-break period in spring. This finding opens a totally new perspective for understanding aquatic productivity in large rivers. This NSERC program on the SLR ecosystem integrates:  1) ETZ as a key habitat of large rivers, acting as a gateway to the sea through the exchanges of carbon and sediments; and 2) winter biological activities in north-temperate rivers, in which river ice biota may substantially contribute to annual primary productivity and carbon transfer along the food web.

"Information technology and consumer products such as cellphones, computers, video recorders, automotive parts etc. rely heavily on microsystems technology (i.e. microelectronics, photonics, wireless circuits and sensors). Future products will desire systems that are more compact, versatile, functional and less expensive.  Higher operating frequencies and wider bandwidths therefore become necessary. To achieve a higher level of integration, we will focus on 1) high speed electronics using advanced low temperature ceramics and 2) high gain beam-scanning planar antennae.

     We have developed a low temperature hydrothermal ceramic process for depositing thin film, thick film and 3-D ceramics onto integrated circuits and printed circuit boards. Most ceramics have to be made at around 1000 degrees or more. This destroys the integrated circuit. We can do it at 150 degrees. No one else has achieved this. This will impact tunable electronics, miniature electronic resonators and filters with the development of appropriate masking methods. We will be the first to integrate 3-D ceramics onto integrated circuits. This will reduce product size and cost. We would also investigate new ceramic materials in our low temperature process.

     High gain beam-scanning planar antennae are important in many applications such as automotive radar, satellite communications, room penetrating security/surveillance radars, and non-contact medical diagnostics. We have developed a new high gain antennae which operates at a single frequency whose  beam is steerable. Currently, the beam can only be scanned over a maximum  angle of 14 degrees. Our research aims to increase the scanning angle. Since the antennae is planar, it can be easily fabricated on a printed circuit board and  integrated in a product, thereby reducing costs.

     These two areas of research will assist the Canadian industry in producing and manufacturing smaller, more versatile and less expensive products.  This will provide a substantial competitive advantage globally in automotive radar, millimeter wireless LAN and medical diagnostics equipment.

"The primary goal of scienctific discovery is to identify simple principles that account for our observations of nature and can be used to predict the future behavior of nature. Biology is the most challenging area of science, because the complexity of the molecules, cells, organs, species and learned behavior that make up biological systems makes it difficult to connect the dots between principles (eg, the association of diseases with DNA errors) and observations (eg, disease symptoms). As a Steacie Fellow, I plan to further my investigations into   mathematical and computational methods that can be used to tackle the problem of inferring scientific principles from huge amounts of noisy biology data. In particular, I will investigate the ""code"" underlying how gene deletions and chemical context influences cell viability in yeast, which shares many genes with more complex organisms, such as human. Turning to human biology, I will study the hidden code that is mysteriously able to reprogram the 22,000 human genes in such a way that they effectively act as over 100,000 genes. In my view, the key to unlocking these biological discoveries is to use recently discovered neural computation techniques that are able to distill simple types of relationships that link together millions or even billions of quantities (eg, pieces of DNA and microarray probe measurements). It is the combination of these methods with state-of-the-art biological sensing methods pioneered by my University of Toronto collaborators, that I think will reveal simple biological principles and connect the dots between them and the complex observations we make of nature.

"A fundamental problem in data analysis and robotic vision involves organizing pieces of data or parts of images in such a way that they can be properly interpreted. For example, to detect an object that a robot on Mars must avoid, the object must be automatically detected in the image by the robot controller. As another example, to screen large numbers of medical images for tumours or other diseased tissues, the tissue of interest should be automatically detected in the image by a computer analyzing large numbers of such images. In this proposal, we will study a new computer algorithm called ""affinity propagation"", which was introduced in the February of 2007 issue of Science, and which shows promise in a variety of areas of data analysis and computer/robotic vision. Because affinity propagation is so new, little is know about why it works so well and how it can be modified to address application-specific issues. In this project, we will extend our theoretical understanding of affinity propagation, and investigate how it can be applied to the important problem of detecting and recognizing objects in scenes.

"Environment Assisted Cracking (EAC) refers to a broad spectrum of phenomena, including stress corrosion cracking and corrosion fatigue, in which a solid fractures due to the concomitant interaction of its stress state with its environment. EAC has been the primary cause of structural failures in nuclear power plants, aircraft, and pipelines. In particular, stress corrosion cracking has been responsible for many costly oil and gas pipeline failures in Canada. A quantitative framework encompassing mechanical and electrochemical interactions and their role in the degradation of solids will reduce the occurrence of such failures by enabling predictive modeling tools for: (i) assessing tolerance for damage, (ii) identifying critical areas for nondestructive inspection, and (iii) generating improved criteria for design.



This project will establish a quantitative, predictive framework for EAC accounting for all relevant processes for a given material-environment combination. Analysis based on the framework will yield an increased understanding of the environmental conditions under which particular mechanisms dominate EAC. The first step will be to formulate relatively simple model problems with reduced geometrical complexity---i.e., with spherical or cylindrical symmetry. These problems will be studied using methods from asymptotic analysis, bifurcation theory, and stability analysis to extract qualitative information concerning expected behavior under a variety of physically meaningful scaling limits. Numerical methods will be used to study more challenging problems and to perform extensive parameter studies.

"Optimization problems arise in a wide range of science and engineering disciplines.  The goal is to minimize (or maximize) an objective function while satisfying certain constraints.  Applications often give rise to optimization problems with significant structure that can be exploited to efficiently solve problems with thousands--sometimes millions--of variables.



This proposal describes a five-year research program to develop innovative optimization algorithms for solving large-scale problems of practical interest.  I will address issues in algorithm development, analysis, and implementation. The research plan involves the following three main components: development of general-purpose algorithms for nonlinear optimization, development of specialized optimization methods for particular applications, and algorithm implementation.



In many applications, optimization is a vital step in a larger procedure; it is therefore critical that optimization algorithms be fast and reliable.  Advances in efficiency and robustness are welcomed by optimization users in industry and academia.  I anticipate that the proposed research will have impact on three groups: researchers in numerical optimization, researchers in specific application fields, and industry practitioners.  The first group will benefit from the extension of current optimization theory and from general algorithm development.  Special-purpose algorithms and the development and release of open-source optimization software will make their impact on the latter two groups.

The problem of building them (i.e. giving explicit constructions) has drawn a lot of attention in the computer science theory and mathematics communities.  There has been significant progress towards explicitly constructing expanders, although a number of compelling problems remain open; much of this progress uses an important connection between expanders and the linear algebra of the graph's adjacency matrix, namely its eigenvalues.

"Speciation is commonly defined as the evolution of reproductive isolation between populations. Understanding mechanisms of speciation is important both for understanding evolution and for successful conservation. However these mechansims, especially the barriers that initiate speciation, are multi-faceted, and many questions remain unanswered. For example, can philopatry (the tendency to breed at the natal site) alone promote speciation in highly mobile organisms? Does segregation during the nonbreeding season prevent gene flow between populations of migratory animals? Can sympatric populations (conspecific organisms that coexist in time and space) form new species? My research team addresses questions such as these in seabirds. Specifically, we conduct detailed analyses of recently diverged or diverging taxa to catch speciation in action, and apply state-of-the-art methods to test explicit, a priori hypotheses designed to discriminate between alternative models of speciation. Seabirds provide useful models for evolutionary genetics because their ecology is generally well understood, and they are easy to sample in large numbers. Our work initially involved temperate and arctic species, and then expanded to include tropical and subtropical seabirds. In the previous funding cycle, we found strong evidence for sympatric speciation, and also showed that, contrary to general theory, population differentiation and speciation in seabirds can occur in the absence of geographic barriers to gene flow. In the present application, I am proposing to use seabirds to test three general questions: (1) the importance of isolation-by-time (separation of breeding seasons) in promoting population differentiation and speciation; (2) the potential for foraging segregation to promote population differentation; and (3) whether strong selection can lead to genetic differentiation and speciation in populations that lack a geographic barrier to gene flow. This program will provide training for 8 graduate and 10-15 undergraduate students, and will aid both our understanding of evolution and the conservation of biodiversity.","Conservation and preservation","Evolution & Ecology"
"Complex fluids abound in both nature and in nearly every industry, e.g. mud, lava, cosmetic creams, cement slurries, pulp suspensions, polymer melts, liquid crystals, ketchup, pastes and yoghurt. Understanding the flow of these materials is a challenging science involving experimentation, computation and modelling, and is necessary if flows of these materials are to be controlled for processing and similar applications. The Laboratory for Complex Fluids at UBC (http://www.math.ubc.ca/~FluidLab/) is an interdisciplinary unit serving researchers in 2 faculties and 5 university departments. The research groups involved in the lab conduct research related to the mechanics of complex, (i.e. structured) fluids. An essential part of the research in many projects involves measurement and characterisation of the physical properties of the fluids, using a rheometer. Since 2001 our principal research grade rotational rheometer has been a Bohlin CVO-R, which is now inoperable. Funding is requested to replace this unit.","Polymers, rubber and plastics","Materials and Chemical Engineering"

"Canada is the 3rd-largest producer of natural gas & 8th-largest producer of crude oil in the world. The upstream sector is the largest single private sector investor in Canada. Many operations required before oil & gas can be produced from a well involve sequential pumping of fluid stages along a circular pipe, e.g. plug cementing, primary cementing, pumping of sand & proppant suspensions, waxy crude oil pipeline restarts. These processes are physically complex for many reasons: pipes are inclined; there may be large density differences between fluids; fluids often exhibit strongly non-Newtonian properties; pumping rates range from slow-laminar flows to fully turbulent flows. Although the hydraulics of a single phase flow of any one of these fluids is quite well understood, multi-phase flows of such liquids are very far from being understood. 

    This fluid mechanics understanding is crucial for the successful design of industrial processes such as those above.  In each process the efficiency can be severely compromised if the fluid stages significantly mix and/or by-pass one-another. Non-piston-like displacement & mixing can lead to contamination or to the placement of incorrect or substandard fluids. Potential consequences include a significant impact on well productivity, destruction of the near-well ecosystem, pollution of the environment and safety hazards. The main scientific problem is a lack of basic knowledge of mixing and displacement flows of non-Newtonian fluids in pipes. This makes it hard to predict the degree of mixing between 2 fluids traveling in a pipe, and hence to accurately design fluid volumes, properties and flow rates for any of these operations. The scientific aim of this project is to begin to provide such knowledge, via a concerted study of the fluid mechanics involving experimental and computational methods. Our technological objective is to use the knowledge that we develop, to enhance well construction & servicing operations worldwide.

"The cost increase for the disposal of biosolids produced during secondary wastewater treatment and the need to improve environmental sustainability require the implementation of more efficient biosolids dewatering technologies. In this context, the Canadian Company EIMCO Water Technologies (EWT; a division of GL&V Canada) has developed an energy-efficient dewatering technology based on electro-osmotic principles. This innovative electro-dewatering technology applies an electrical field and pressure to increase the sludge dryness from 15% to 30-50% while using less than 30% of the energy required by a heat dryer for the same performance. It was also observed that this technology allows the reduction of pathogen counts in the sludge, which opens the possibility of classifying the resulting dewatered biosolids as Class A (the highest microbiological biosolids quality) according to the US-EPA. This classification would allow the application of electro-dewatered biosolids to agricultural lands, adding significant value to EWT's electro-dewatering technology and reducing its environmental footprint. 



The purpose of this study is to identify and optimize the mechanisms of pathogen inactivation during electrochemical dewatering of sludge. The main hypothesis is that reactive oxidative chemical species are formed on the electrode surfaces during electro-dewatering, and they are then transported by advection or diffusion through the biosolids cake to inactivate pathogens. The following will be tested and modeled during the project to evaluate this hypothesis: (i) transport of the chemical species in the cake, (ii) pathogen inactivation potential of the various chemical species, and (iii) subsequent stability of the biosolids in terms of pathogen regrowth and odour production. In addition, other potential inactivation mechanisms will be evaluated in relation to operating conditions, including high temperature, high and low pH, and metal concentrations. By optimizing the performance of EWT's technology and thus strengthening its marketability, this project will increase the competitiveness of a Canadian high technology company and provide new environmentally sustainable solutions for the wastewater treatment sector.","Waste, waste management and recycling","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"
"Designers of activated sludge wastewater treatment systems increasingly use mathematical models describing the activity of microbial communities to predict the future performance of the systems. These models used to be only based on very simple biochemical reactions describing the overall conversion of substrates to biomass. This is now changing as the advantage of including in the models details concerning definitions of bacterial metabolism and interactions between bacterial populations have recently been recognized. This modeling approach is promising to reduce the number of expensive recalibration experiments performed by practitionners.  However, it is difficult to properly integrate metrabolic information to models describing activated sludge since only a few studies exist on the physiology of bacteria at long solids retention times (more then 5 days) and in situations of rapid (few hours) cycling between feast (presence of electron donors outside the cells) and famine (absence of electron donors) like in activated sludge systems. The proposed research will palliate to this lack of knowledge by studying metabolism of Rhodococcus RHA1, a recently sequenced environmental isolate, in these conditions.  Specifically, gene expression and the flux of carbon through the cellular network of biochemical reactions will be determined at different times during the feast-famine cycle.  The data will be obtained for the wild-type Rhodococcus RHA1 and for a knockout mutant unable to synthesize poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) typically produced during the feast phase.  Finally, the findings made with Rhodococcus RHA1 will be extrapolated to the organization of the microbial community by using microarray to compare the gene expression of populations containing PHB and populations not containing PHB.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng."

"Liquid crystals, gels, polymers and lipid membranes are all examples of soft condensed matter; these materials are characterized by weak intermolecular interactions, mechanical softness, and a susceptibility to thermal fluctuations.  Many of these materials are either two-dimensional, quasi-two dimensional, or fractal and they exhibit a rich range of behaviour including phase transitions, pattern formation, and non-linear material properties.  They are also of great practical interest - contact lenses are made of polymeric gels, and liquid crystals form the basis for many display screens - and they can be used as models of more complicated biological systems.  This field has the potential both to produce interesting physics and novel applications.  

    Our focus is the relationship between microscopic structure and macroscopic material properties in several systems. We study the microstructure of polymer films formed from copolymers consisting of hydrophobic and conducting blocks.  The goal of these studies is to achieve fundamental understanding of the relationship between microstructure and conductivity in ionic polymers, leading to more informed design of these materials, critical for their application in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells.  A second research area explores the relationship between microstructure and rheology of yield-stress fluids, materials that flow or yield only when a critical stress is applied; everyday examples include mud, shaving foam and mayonnaise.  We study the light scattered by these materials to study diffusion and elasticity at small length scales and to characterize the microstructure of the material.  The goal of these studies is to uncover universal aspects of yield stress behaviour, leading to the development of microscopic theories.  We also study properties of vesicles, spherical shells formed from lipid bilayers that are used in drug delivery systems and as model membranes.  Here we investigate the properties of the extrusion process by which they are made and material properties of lipid bilayers, including the tension at which they rupture.  These studies are of interest to researchers using this technique as well as to physicists interested in the equilibrium shapes and dynamics of lipid systems.

"The present program is on solving a broad question, which is to estimate parameters of solutions to ODEs (ordinary differential equations) that occur in biostatistical applications and have cyclic solutions. We start with ecology, and the emphasis is on predator-prey interactions; in practice, many animal populations exhibit oscillatory behaviour. Therefore, in their models, ecologists are considering systems that admit limit cycles or spiral to an equilibrium. In our proposal we introduce a simple method for estimating elements that are put forward by the qualitative analysis of the ODE system, like isoclines, e.g. The method works whenever periodicity is present. Once the estimation is performed, one can test various models as well. The originality of the present program is to work in the phase plane, and the methodology is an extension of the one developed in Froda & Colavita (2005) and Froda & Nkurunziza (2006). 



From the applied point of view, various  areas of ecological research are concerned by this proposal. At first, we consider the choice of an appropriate predator-prey model at one geographical site. Later,  we should be able to extend our methodology and fit predator-prey models in metapopulations, i.e. when the habitat is fragmented (e.g. after habitat destruction). Understanding the impact of habitat destruction on animal behaviour is extremely important in conservation biology. 



It is to be noted that our method allows to discriminate among alternative models, a problem which is debated among ecologists, and is central to the field. 



Finally, in the long run, other fields of application  can be considered, like the study of epidemic models.

"Projected warming through the next century will be most strongly expressed at high latitudes.  These areas are highly sensitive to environmental change and play an important role in the global climate system.  Future impacts at high latitudes of projected warming are not well understood due to the complex feedbacks associated with the Arctic system and the potential for dynamical responses to forcing.  One means to test the reliability of projected warming is to develop paleo-records which document the impacts of warming from past conditions (interglacials) when climate was warmer than present for sustained intervals.  The proposed research focuses on establishing records of past climate as warm or warmer than present from sites in the interior of Alaska, central and northern Yukon Territory.  This research makes us of, and further develops, the record of distal volcanic ash (tephra) in this region which allows discrete timelines over large areas to be identified in order to connect records between sites, and establish independent ages of relict permafrost and paleoenvironmental records.

"Gravity is one of the fundamental forces of nature, yet how well do we know it, especially when it is stronger than we have ever experienced in the lab? Cosmology and astrophysics provide a good place to search for answers in the strong gravity environments of early Universe and black holes. Is Einstein gravity the final answer? Do extra dimensions exist? Can we see them in the sky? What happens around (and inside) a black hole? These are the kinds of questions that I want to address through my research.



Modern cosmological and astrophysical observations are improving at an amazing pace, and can now be used to directly probe places where gravity is at its strongest: the beginning of the Universe and just outside of the black holes. To resolve long-standing puzzles such as hierarchy and cosmological constant problems, totally new ideas about the fabric of our spacetime are being considered by theorists, many of them inspired by the string theory. These new theories naturally modify the Einstein's general relativity and if we know what to look for, we might see these changes in the observations.



The main objective of the proposed research is to study predictions of these modern theories and to relate those predictions to existing and future observations. I work on physics of the early Universe, dark matter and dark energy candidates in fundamental theories, extra dimensions and their role in cosmology, astrophysical black holes and their quantum internal structure.

"Over the next grant period we will continue two streams of research, one concerned with continuing our research on how different types of visual motion are processed in the visual areas of bird brains, and the second stream is directed at understanding the information that animals, particularly the monarch butterfly, use to orient themselves in the correct direction during their migration. 

 The first stream will concentrate on two major projects, one which is a continuation of our discovery of neurons in the bird brain that calculate the time to collision with an approaching object using the rate of expansion of the object's image. This work has both theoretical and practical applications. Theoretically this research supports the view that the formula used to calculate ""time to collision"" is simple and used by most animals investigated, ranging from invertebrates to vertebrates, including humans. Practically, these findings are giving rise to research on driving behaviour of humans by one of my collaborators, and the design of car brake-light systems that reduce rear-end collisions.

In the second stream of research on migration we have developed a flight simulator to allow us to study monarch migratory behavior in the lab. We have shown they use the sun as a compass and compensate for the time of day. Now we have developed another critical piece of equipment that measures butterfly attraction to milkweed plants required for their caterpillars. We are also using this device to test various volatile substances we have collected from the trees in Mexico the monarchs cluster on over winter. Preliminary  results show we may have isolated a cocktail of substances that contain the molecular attractants that guide the monarch in the final phase of their migration directly back to the same trees in Mexico occupied by their great grandparents over the previous winter. We also plan to use sophisticated chemical analyses to identify the specific molecular substances and determine their structure. This may be critical in preserving the over-wintering habitats of monarchs.

"The hazards posed by shrapnel from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are of primary concern to the Canadian Forces. In order to meet these challenges, the continued incorporation of new materials and technologies is necessary in the development of more flexible, lightweight armour systems. The integration of Shear Thickening Fluids (STF) embedded in traditional ballistic fabrics is one such technology that could be practical. The physical characteristics of STF, which consists of fine solid particles suspended in a carrier fluid, which are advantageous for protective equipment is that the materials are field-responsive. This means that the materials will behave differently under various threats. For example, under the strain involved with normal motion, the fluids are able to flow and the armour would be flexible, however upon application of a high-strain-rate force such as a ballistic event, the materials stiffen to provide protection. This enables systems involving STF to potentially be utilized in limb protection systems for soldiers to meet contemporary shrapnel threats from IEDs. Additionally, such flexible protection systems could be of interest to police forces as well as private security personnel. The proposed research program consists of a comprehensive experimental and computational investigation of the fundamental behaviour of STF under high-strain rate dynamic loading while applying the same amplitude forces that are involved in ballistic events.  The ballistic response of a variety of fluid-solid particle systems will be studied using single-stage light gas guns to determine the optimum system for protecting against ballistic impact threats. The application of STF technology to develop new field-responsive armours would be invaluable to the Canadian Forces, as well as to other security personnel.

"My proposed research program includes several project areas which all involve multiphase systems (solid/gas or solid/liquid) in which one or more of the phases typically reacts chemically.  The projects are primarily experimental, and supported by analytical and numerical modelling.  Applications of the three proposed areas of research include i) improvements to the performance of commercial explosives, ii) protection of personnel and structures against blast waves and ballistic impact, and iii) the combustion synthesis of advanced materials with unusual properties.  A summary of the three research areas is as follows.

i) Many commercial explosives contain added metal particles to improve the performance of the explosive (e.g., the ability to crack and move rock).  In order to predict the performance of such an explosive, it is necessary to have information regarding the motion and burning rate of the metal particles in the combustion gases and surrounding air.  Lab-scale experiments will be carried out to determine the particle reaction mechanism and the dependence of particle combustion rate on the particle and flow properties.

ii) There has been considerable interest recently in Canada in the development of materials for the protection of personnel and structures against blast waves and ballistic impacts from accidental or deliberate explosions.  Experiments are proposed to design and test a variety of novel rigid and compressible material combinations to mitigate the effects of a blast wave.  For improved ballistic protection, materials that contain a shear-thickening fluid will be investigated under impact loading. 

iii) In the final research area, nanosized metal oxide particles will be produced using a metal dust flame technique with applications to material science (e.g., high-strength ceramics).  A related experiment will study the reaction between nanosized aluminum powder and water for the production of pure hydrogen gas to be used in a fuel cell.  Finally, reactions in metal powder mixtures will be induced with a shock wave to generate solids with potentially new and useful properties.

"Animals must consume energy to balance expenditures, but what are the signals that tell animals when to eat?  How are these signals communicated to the brain?  How do neurons in the brain respond to these signals?  These questions are central to understanding perception of hunger, and regulation of energy balance.

     A group of neurons in the brain, called subfornical organ (SFO) neurons are specialized to detect levels of hormones circulating in the blood, including hormones that regulate hunger and feeding (such as leptin and insulin). My preliminary experiments indicate that rat SFO neurons exhibit changes in gene expression after a 48 hour fast. Two of the down-regulated genes encode voltage gated Na+ channels, proteins known to directly control neuronal electrical communication.  This proposal has three specific aims.  The first aim is to identify which population of neurons in the rat SFO is altered by a 48h fast, and to describe in detail the changes in electrical properties of these neurons.  This will be accomplished by mapping the distributions of neurons that express the down-regulated Na+ channels and recording electrical properties of these neurons before and after a fast.   Because research by others has shown that circulating levels of hormones that regulate hunger and feeding  change with fasting, the second specific aim is to investigate if any of these hormones may be responsible for driving the observed change in gene expression.  This will be accomplished by growing neurons in cell culture, then measuring changes in gene expression and electrical properties after treatment with hormones such as leptin and insulin.  The third objective is to determine the specific contributions of one of the down-regulated Na+ channel proteins to the regulation of electrical activity of SFO neurons. This will be determined using techniques to specifically turn off expression of the Na+ channel, then measuring changes in electrical properties of these neurons.  Together, this research will increase our understanding of the molecular physiology of how the central nervous system percieves hunger signals and regulates energy balance.

"A key uncertainty regarding recovery of woodland caribou in Ontario is how much habitat is enough to manage caribou extinction risk at an acceptable level. Population Viability Analysis, often termed PVA, can be very useful in estimating how extinction risk should vary in relation to habitat composition at the landscape scale over time horizons that are meaningful for resource managers. By identifying complex ecological linkages and trade-offs between habitat-based factors influencing demographic rates, the risk of extinction can be reduced to tolerable levels when balanced against other land uses. Our project is designed to develop models of movement and habitat use by caribou, wolves, and moose, based on satellite telemetry data. These movement sub-models will be linked into a spatially-explicit PVA model for Ontario caribou, incorporating realistic patterns of migration, habitat selection, demography, predation risk, forest succession, and disturbance due to both fire and

"Few studies have evaluated patterns of space use and movements by both predators and prey at the same time to explain and predict their co-occurrence in natural landscapes and the resulting patterns of predator-prey dynamics. I propose to extend my field studies of carnivores (lions, cheetahs, hyenas, and leopards) and herbivores (wildebeest, gazelles, zebra, topi, hartebeest) in the Serengeti ecosystem to test predictive models of movement and spatial interactions. Study animals will be equipped with GPS radio-collars to allow detailed records of their hourly movements across the landscape. Computer models will then be used to predict movement patterns in relation to a range of habitat features, as well as the spatial distribution of food resources and carnivores. 



I also propose to study spatial dynamics of the rainbow lizard (Agama agama) in relation to its insect prey in Serengeti. These lizards live on rocky outcrops, widely spaced across the Serengeti landscape. I will study factors causing local lizard populations to fluctuate over time, as well as regulatory factors that stabilize lizard abundance. Factors synchronizing lizard abundance in different parts of the Serengeti Plains will be identified.



Theoretical models show that adding a spatial dimension can substantially affect consumer-resource dynamics. This is particularly true when individuals show complex behavioral responses to the ecological landscape. In the longer term, I plan to imbed these spatial movement models into spatially-explicit consumer-resource simulations to explore the potential consequences of spatial interactions on long-term population dynamics. This program linking movement behavior and ecological consequences at the population level fills a critical gap in our understanding of ecosystem function as well as practical grounds for conservation and management.

For those laboratories that handle radioactive materials for labeling, certain protocols must be followed to be in compliance with both Federal and Provincial laws.

The robust nature of this small molecule is due to a number of factors including, a large bond dissociation energy (945 kJ/mol), the lack of a dipole moment, and a large barrier to addition and/or removal of electrons.  Of course, it is well known that under extreme conditions, N2 will react with H2 over an activated iron surface to generate ammonia; this energy-intensive catalytic transformation, known as the Haber-Bosch process, supplies the global need for NH3-derived fertilizers.  In contrast, biological systems convert molecular nitrogen into ammonia under ambient conditions; there are a number of variants of the enzyme Nitrogenase but the most common utilize protein-stabilized sulfido-clusters of iron and molybdenum as the cofactor (FeMoco).  While discovery of a homogeneous version of the Haber-Bosch process is the goal of a number of groups around the world, another worthwhile goal is to develop new reactions for molecular nitrogen that result in the formation of high-value organonitrogen materials, such as amines and N-heterocycles.  This proposal outlines a series of experiments designed to accelerate breakthroughs in the area of dinitrogen functionalization.  Also of importance are other stable molecules that might be coerced into new reactivity patterns by interaction with appropriate combinations of ligands and metals; for example, carbon dioxide (CO2) and alkanes (RH) are also very robust molecules that will be examined as possible feedstocks to generate higher-value materials using purposefully designed homogeneous catalysts.

"Adverse winter weather has a significant impact on the safety and mobility of highways. Every year provincial and municipal governments in Canada expend more than $1 billion dollars on snow and ice control, which includes the application of over 5 million tonnes of salt - a substance of significant environmental concern.  The goal of the proposed research program is to address some of the key issues arising in winter road maintenance.  In particular, this research focuses on the following three research themes: 

1. Quantifying safety and mobility benefits of maintenance operations. The primary goal of this research theme is to develop models for the relationship between safety and mobility of highways and various storm, road, and maintenance factors.  These models will enable more rigorous evaluation of alternative winter maintenance policies, methods and technologies. 

2. Estimating and predicting road surface conditions. This research topic will investigate the characteristics of various road surface condition measures and their relationships.  The main focus will be on discrimination, spatial mapping and forecasting of road surface conditions.  This effort will establish a foundation for developing innovative maintenance technologies and winter traveler information systems. 

3. Planning, scheduling and simulating winter road maintenance. The main objective of this topic is to develop decision support tools that can be used to identify optimal policies and solutions for deicing and anti-icing operations.  The research will focus on how to account for inherent uncertainty in various system parameters and how to solve realistic sized problems using some of the latest optimization techniques. 

 

The proposed methodology combines applied and basic research with high potential for generating significant economic, environmental and technical benefits and training highly qualified personnel.

"Mixture models are of considerable value in the statistical analysis of data because they provide a very flexible way of modeling. At the same time, the subject of mixture models is particularly challenging because the traditional theory of parametric inference often can not be applied directly to problems in mixture models. The objective of the proposal is to develop theory and innovative methodology in the field of mixture models and empirical likelihood methods to cope with statistical problems in a variety of applications for which no simple solution exists. This proposal is organized by three projects. In the first project, a novel modeling of regression mixtures with scalar responses and functional predictors will be carried out. The functional principal component techniques will be used to achieve dimension reduction. Order selection in the resulting regression mixture will then be addressed. Mixture models have many natural applications in genetics. In the second project, mixture models will be used to detect allelic association in the presence of locus and /or allelic heterogeneity. Since the mixture model approach takes into account locus heterogeneity, it is expected to have greater power in association analysis than other existing methods. The empirical likelihood, which is a nonparametric method of inference based on a data-driven likelihood ratio function,  has become a widely used and studied statistical method over the past fifteen years. In the third project, the empirical likelihood method will be explored to produce efficient inference in missing data problems by using auxiliary information. This research program is novel and multi-faceted. It will draw on several important statistical tools such as mixture models, functional data analysis, and empirical likelihood methods to tackle important scientific questions. It raises several theoretical problems of interest, and in addition, success of this research program will yield significant contribution to the theory and application of mixture models. In turn, these results will be useful in problems arising in many fields in the natural sciences and engineering. The theory and methodologies developed will also have great scope for extensions and applications.

"Transient flows can cause hydraulic failures such as collapse of infrastructure, manhole cover blow off, geysers, and basement flooding, as well as the release of air from the manholes. The transition phenomenon coupled to the trapped air problem has critical effects, yet existing numerical models (such as Mike, HydroWorks, SWMM ...) dealing with the drainage systems simulations either neglect or excessively simplify it. In fact, such models generally use non-dynamic hypotheses such as the open-slot approach and the non presence of trapped air into flowing water. The transient flow dynamic analysis should be part of both the design and the rehabilitation processes for building highly efficient sustainable drainage infrastructures. Because the current design approach lacks this kind of analysis, drainage systems face unpredictable phenomena, making them unsafe and vulnerable.



The present proposal is original and innovative in the sense that the transition phenomena occurring in the drainage systems will be modeled by solving the multiphase flow of air and water with the shock-fitting technique. The proposed research project is part of my main ongoing research program regarding the development of an optimal stormwater management plan. Results from the present project will be combined later on with applicable alternative retention techniques to optimally design and rehabilitate drainage systems which will be able to control the flooding risk.

"Digital imagery and related data, such as digital terrain models, have become more common as sensors from satellites to digital cameras have increased in availability.  This development provides the opportunity to extract quantitative data that were previously not available and contribute to a wide range of geological investigations.  My research interest is to develop techniques to extract such data and/or apply them to geological problems of a variety of scales.



    )	On Mars, we use a technique that combines satellite images and digital terrain models from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) camera on board the European Mars Express orbiter.  This technique enables us to measure the 3D orientation of large scale layers.  On Earth, this type of measurement is an integral part of geological studies and provides data that play an important role for the understanding of geological histories. The HRSC camera was the first instrument to provide elevation data with a sufficient resolution for such measurements on Mars.  We developed the technique and are the first group to use it. This method will be the only way to obtain the 3D data until humans are able to take field measurements on the surface of Mars.  Our work improves our understanding of the origin of those layers and provides insights into the geological history of Mars.



    )	At the other end of the image scale, I use a special microscope-based adapter to obtain data about individual grains within deformed rocks. Those data are used to increase our knowledge of how rocks deform at the microscopic scale, which is important to our understanding of many aspects of plate tectonics and mountain building processes.

"ALPHA (Antihydrogen Laser Physics Apparatus) is an international project at CERN, whose primary aim is to test fundamental symmetries between matter and antimatter using trapped antihydrogen atoms, the simplest atomic form of neutral antimatter. Since its approval by CERN in 2005 and the first beam in 2006, ALPHA has made substantial progress, and the construction of the experiment is nearly complete. Canadian scientists, now some 30% of the Collaboration, have been able to make important contributions from the beginning.  It is the purpose of this Project Grant application to request support that will allow us to fully exploit the ALPHA apparatus in our effort to trap antihydrogen atoms to perform spectroscopy..

     Cold atoms of antihydrogen promise a unique opportunity to study the properties of atomic antimatter, and via comparisons with its well-studied matter-counterpart, the possibility to test fundamental symmetries of Nature such as CPT invariance. The anti-atoms previously produced at CERN, while nearly at rest, were not confined and soon annihilated on the walls of the apparatus. In order to probe matter-antimatter symmetry at the highest possible precision, it is essential that the anti-atoms be suspended in vacuum to allow for detailed interrogation via laser light or microwaves.

     Cold antihydrogen is produced in ALPHA by mixing antiprotons and positrons in a Penning trap. The antiprotons are obtained from CERN's Antiproton Decelerator, currently the world's only facility providing high quality antiproton beams, while the positrons are accumulated from a radioactive source. In order to magnetically trap neutral antihydrogen atoms, one needs a field minimum in the region of antihydrogen production. Important features of ALPHA in confronting the associated technical challenges include one of the world's most powerful cold positron traps, the novel use of a superconducting octupole magnet for anti-atom trapping, and the application of subatomic physics techniques e.g., sophisticated detectors and analysis software, that will unambiguously demonstrate trapping of antihydrogen.

"Mixed-integer programming is a very powerful and useful tool to help deal with complex real world problems. It has been successfully applied to solve important problems in areas like mining, forestry, air transportation, telecommunications, health care, logistics and many others. In fact, any problem that involves decisions that are discrete (like opening or not opening a factory, number of trucks to buy, etc.) and where an efficient use of scarce resources is needed, is a good candidate for benefiting from Mixed-integer programming techniques. 



In spite of the great advances that this field has gone through over the last few decades, there are still several challenges that need to be overcome so that Mixed-integer programming can be applied to a newer/larger/broader set of problems. 



My research program is focused towards practical aspects of Mixed-integer programming, developing tools that will help speed up solution times and, as a consequence, make it possible to apply it to a larger set of real world problems. This involves: (1) developing new theoretical results that lead to a better understanding of properties and characteristics of mixed-integer programming problems and (2) developing new solution methods and techniques that ideally have both nice theoretical properties and good practical performance.



In addition to considering methods for general mixed-integer programs, I also intend to study its use for the solution of some particular structured problems like vehicle routing where problem-specific strategies that take advantage of the underlying structure can be very effective.

                  Eating for pleasure: Brain reward mechanisms regulating food intake



      One last morsel of food remains on your dinner plate. You hesitate, but in spite of feeling full you manage to eat the last bite. Your plate is now clean and your hunger satisfied. Without a thought of eating any more food your eyes glance over  the dessert menu. The anticipation of the novel sensory experience the tasty desserts offer makes you perk up and, before you know it, you are devouring another mouthful . The rewarding effects of palatable foods can drive us to eat even when we are satiated.  Which mechanisms in the brain are responsible for motivating us to consume foods rich in fat and sugar? Our research explores the neural pathways that underlie food motivation. Research has identified circulating hormones and nutrients that act in the brain to regulate food intake and energy expenditure. More recently, we and others have demonstrated how some of these signals, like leptin and ghrelin, can target neurons of the midbrain dopamine system that are known to mediate the rewarding and addictive properties of drugs of abuse. On the one hand, our goal is to discover how exactly these and other peripheral signals influence dopamine neurons and food-motivated behavior. On the other hand, we are interested in determining how eating a high-fat diet over time modulates dopamine signaling and communication with other neural signals that have been implicated in food palatability and reward. Excessive intake of palatable food with high caloric density is largely responsible for the epidemic of obesity. As we are confronted with concerns of obesity and obesity-related illnesses, elucidating the mechanisms that regulate motivation for food is an important goal.

"The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop mathematical models to conduct high resolution simulation of novel environmental-friendly advanced building integrated energy systems and their optimal configurations and control strategies that can be used with state-of-the-art building energy simulation software for the design, analysis, and development of super energy efficient buildings towards the net-zero energy building status. The research is divided into five subprojects: 1) Identification and Optimization of Housing Characteristics of Super Energy Efficient Solar House, 2) Development of Least Cost Energy Retrofit Upgrades Towards Net-zero Energy Status, 3) Modeling of Integrated Wind, Solar PV and Thermal, and Heat Pump Hybrid Energy Systems, 4) Development of Optimal Predictive Control of Combined In-floor and Radiant Conditioning System with Hybrid HVAC Systems in Solar Houses, 5) Dynamic Whole House Modeling and Simulation of Net-Zero Energy House. The research will focus on new and innovative renewable energy technologies such as solar hybrid PV/thermal collectors, solar assisted air- and ground-source heat pumps, combined infloor/radiant panel/forced air spacing conditioning system, strategic applications of thermal mass and phase change materials as integral part(s) of the building, and hybrid combinations of different systems, as well as their overall optimal control strategies considering the building and its HVAC system dynamics and short term weather forecast information for maximum utilization of on-site renewable energy potentials while maintaining optimal thermal comfort. Proper configuration, integration, and control of the advanced hybrid building integrated energy systems are the major key drivers in advancing next level of energy efficiency in building towards net-zero energy status. The results from the proposed research will provide realistic and accurate modeling tools for designing, assessing, and component sizing of building integrated renewable energy systems and their optimal control strategies in advanced hybrid HVAC systems to foster faster adoption of these environmental-friendly, clean energy systems in the building sector.","Alternative energy resources","Mechanical Engineering - B"
"Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) is a technology of automatic object identification. A typical RFID system consists of multiple tags and readers, and an infrastructure for handling the high volume of data. The tag is a small device that can be attached to an object, such as a person or a product, for the purpose of unique identification. The reader is an instrument, positioned in a strategic location, that communicates with the RFID tag. It broadcasts a radio signal to the tag, which then transmits its information back to the reader. Streams of RFID data are then stored in a database for analysis. Although RFID would be useful in a broad spectrum of applications, such as supply chain management, e-passports, and patient care and management, the uniquely identifiable tags pose a threat to privacy by tracking a person's movements or profiling an individual. Some privacy advocates have even labeled RFID as the ""worst thing that ever happened to consumer privacy."" Clearly, the privacy concern is an obstacle to the acceptance of RFID technology. 

    This research program overcomes the privacy obstacle in RFID information systems and develops a series of anonymization methods to transform the underlying RFID data into a version that hides sensitive information, yet keeps it useful for data analysis. RFID data poses new challenges to traditional database, data mining, and privacy-preserving technologies due to its unique characteristics: it is time-dependent, location-dependent, and is generated in large volumes of stream data. Previous works in privacy-preserving RFID technology mainly focused on the hardware and communication protocol layers instead of the database layer, in which a large amount of data actually resides. 

    The research results will contribute to the core data mining and privacy preservation domains, as well as the industries that employ RFID technology, sensor networks, and location-based services. The proposed research will result in a secure environment for employing RFID technology without sacrificing its information usefulness.","Information, computer and communication technologies","Computing and Information Sciences - A"

"The equipment requested is a general-purpose haptic device, that is, a device which can provide force feedback to the user. The device requested can sense the user's input with six degrees of freedom (DOF's) - position along three axes (left and right, back and forth, up and down) as well as rotations about the three axes. More dramatically, however, this device also provides six DOF's of force feedback.

The objectives of our research are to develop better methods for exploring 3-D image data representing complex natural structures; generating 3-D models from the image data; and manipulating those models.

Complex natural structures are often studied using 3-D imagery, but understanding such image data is challenging. Force feedback gives the user many more clues about the data, making interaction more intuitive.

It is often advantageous to work with explicit 3-D models rather than raw image data, but building complex 3-D models is hard. Image segmentation (identifying structures within the images) is the core of building models but is difficult and time-consuming. The use of force feedback should lead to faster and better manual and semi-automatic image segmentation.

If complex 3-D models are hard to create, they are also hard to understand and manipulate once they have been created. Force feedback will make such manipulations much more intuitive and meaningful.

The approaches developed here will be applicable to data analysis and model building in a vast range of fields - mineralogy, paleontology, biology, anatomy and many others. In all of those fields it will also lead to improved methods for teaching and learning at many levels, from Continuing Education all the way down to high school and perhaps even elementary school. We shall particularly address the teaching of anatomy and training for diagnostic and surgical procedures.

The graduate students using this device will be well prepared for jobs in the field of haptics, which is growing especially fast in the area of medical applications.","Learning and education","Electrical and Computer Engineering"

The overall objective of this research is to fully understand the computational processes underlying colour perception. While of intrinsic scientific interest, understanding colour perception is also essential for improving colour reproduction in the context of digital cameras, displays, and printers. In addition, it has important applications in computer vision in terms of colour-based object recognition, and the analysis of the colour changes created by shadows, interreflections, wetness and transparency.  Our approach to these issues utilizes the computational view of colour;  i.e., that human colour perception and the ways in which colour is used in understanding the visual world can be explored and explained as computational processes.  Specific short-term objectives include: (1) Working on full-spectrum printing to overcome the problem that arises with traditional 4-colour CMYK printing; namely, that printed colours that match one another under one light can, under a second light, change their appearance such that they no longer match.  (2) Investigating whether colour images with more than the standard 3 RGB bands might lead to improved colour constancy. The interesting and counterintuitive result we have so far is that the extra information in multispectral images does not yield significant improvement. (3) Improving picture rendering by identifying the manipulations that are predicted by colour appearance theory and compare those to the manipulations that have been practiced for decades in photography, video, and motion picture production.  The aim is to formalize some of the 'art' of film making techniques in terms of existing colour appearance models and simultaneously explore the limitations of these models. (4) Exploring uses of quaternions (4-tuple complex numbers) as a representation for RGB colours. The quaternion representation has the advantage that the 3 RGB components are treated as a single number.

"Risk management is of prime importance in financial institutions engaged in financial uncertainties, and risk measurement is its natural precursor. In light of this, at least three substantial subjects have to be addressed: the multivariate probabilistic model possessing a convenient dependence structure - to describe risks' behavior; the choice of appropriate risk functionals - to translate the implications of the model to risk parlance; and the (analytical) solutions for the latter in the framework of the former - to, actually, measure risk.



The present project is intended to contribute to the aforementioned pillars of 'successful' risk measurement. Namely, we shall first propose and investigate a number of new multivariate probabilistic models having convenient dependence structures and important, especially in finance and actuarial science, univariate marginal distributions. Briefly, the herein suggested models can be considered multivariate generalizations of the well known univariate exponential dispersion models. In this project, the multivariate densities of the aforementioned multivariate classes of distributions, their higher order (conditional) moments and products of these moments, Chebyshev's type inequalities, asymptotic behaviors and second order optimal estimation techniques will be developed.



In addition, we shall accomplish a thorough risk analysis in the framework of the suggested models. Applying some powerful tail-based risk functionals e.g. the tail conditional expectation and the tail variance premiums, we shall obtain analytical expressions for 1.) the risk of the whole financial institution (risk inherent in the convolution of the univariate dependent marginals), and 2.) the consequent allocation of this risk to its sources (risk contribution of each marginal to the measure obtained in Point 1 bearing in mind the existing dependence structure). Numerous simulation studies and a software packet will be produced to illustrate the results.

"Parasite infections shape the evolution and ecology of fishes, but we have little understanding of how rapidly changes in parasite levels lead to changes in populations, communities, and ecosystems. Our proposed research project will investigate these questions through collaboration with a 5 million dollar research initiative funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) of the United States. This NSF project involves experimental manipulations of whole stream ecosystems on the tropical island of Trinidad. In particular, guppies (a small and prolific freshwater fish) will be introduced from streams characterized by high predation and parasitism into formerly guppy-free streams characterized by low predation and parasitism. Very detailed monitoring by the NSF team following this introduction will enable a detailed investigation of the speed of evolutionary change in the guppies and any consequences for interacting species and for the ecosystem. The NSF project focuses entirely on the effects of predation, whereas we will add the parasite dimension. Our study thus examines the ecological and evolutionary consequences of shielding a fish population from one of its major parasites. This is a common strategy in aquaculture and in the conservation of endangered species in Canada, and our results will therefore inform the consequences of these activities. For example, a reduction in parasitism may lead to a rapid loss of resistance to parasites, thus having negative consequences when populations are re-exposed to parasites. The potential relevance to Canadian fishes is particularly likely because the specific ectoparasite under study (Gyrodactylus) is an extremely important pathogen of freshwater and marine fishes in Canada. Our proposed project is novel because no studies have examined the consequences of controlled and replicated experimental manipulations of parasitism in otherwise natural ecosystems. It is timely because the NSF experiments commence this spring and we need to have our sampling team in place as soon as possible.","Animal management (animal diseases, breeding)","SRO Program - College of Reviewers"
"Providing sufficient and high-quality food for the steadily increasing global human population is one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century. In the face of world-wide declining ocean fisheries, aquaculture provides a promising alternative: the industrial production of nutritionally valuable food of aquatic origin. Large-scale aquaculture is a comparatively recent industrial sector. Its future in Canada depends on research that leads the way to economically efficient, yet environmentally sustainable methods of production. Our team of university and governmental scientists believes that the key to achieving this goal lies in understanding and managing aquaculture facilities as a food-web that is embedded in the natural, spatially extended marine ecosystem. We will cooperate with the mussel aquaculture industry on the Magdalen Islands and conduct experimental research that applies the principles of food web and ecosystem ecology. We will explore how the flows of matter and energy across the food web can be managed in a way that results in an increased production of high-quality, harvestable shellfish. Our approach is novel in that it goes beyond examining these processes at the scale of the individual mussel but attempts to understand the process of shellfish production in an ecosystem context. We anticipate that our  research will affect governmental policy and eventually translate into novel production methods in Canadian shellfish aquaculture, mediated by our governmental and industrial supporting organizations.",Aquaculture,"Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Food and Bioproducts"
"Change is an integral property of ecological systems. Populations wax and wane and become extinct, communities exhibit complicated dynamics such as predator-prey cycles. Ecologists have studied these changes as ecological phenomena and have used ecological approaches and methodologies, but populations are also subject to evolutionary change. My research program investigates how ecological and evolutionary processes occur at the same time scale and under which circumstances they can be co-responsible for the dynamical changes of ecosystems.

The genetic diversity that exists within species is the raw material for evolution and determines the degree to which evolutionary adaptation to environmental change is possible. This means that this type of biodiversity may be just as important for ecological change as diversity among species. In my lab, we study the feedback of ecological and evolutionary processes and the role of genetic diversity by running experiments with live, controlled model communities of microscopic freshwater plankton organisms. We study the population dynamics that arise from their interaction and assess the role of evolution by experimentally manipulating food web structure and genetic diversity. We complement and compare our experimental work with the predictions of mathematical food web models that also include evolutionary change.

In the next five years we will use these experimental model systems to investigate (1) the general dynamics of complex food webs with different levels of genetic diversity, (2) the ecological and evolutionary effects of increasing CO2 levels and of toxins produced by blue-green algae on plankton dynamics, and (3) how the spatial organization of ecosystems and the migration of individuals within ecosystems influence the dynamics.

"Understanding the factors that control how forest ecosystems function near their northern limits is critical to predicting how forests will respond to climate change. This research aims to increase understanding of the relative role of climate, soil and biotic factors in controlling the distribution of forests dominated by trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) in the James Bay region of northern Quebec. Our recent work in aspen and black spruce forests in the northern Quebec have shown that establishment and growth of trees depends on the interacting effects of vegetation, soil organic matter decomposition and accumulation, soil nutrition, and site disturbance. We have developed a new approach for multivariate analysis of spatial pattern that improves detection of ecological relationships in the field. The new research will build on these lines of enquiry. The proposed program will study the roles of climate, site, and carbon and nutrient cycling in controlling the distribution of aspen forests across a climatic transect from central Quebec to the northern limit of their range. 'Biocentric' climatic indices will be developed to define the 1300 km transect. Aspen stands will be characterized by tree growth rates, nutrient cycling and soil properties. Patterns of change in these variables with increasing latitude will be compared to patterns of change in climatic indices to test the hypothesis that climate is the dominant control. Since trees respond in an integrated way to multiple stresses, the effect of climate depends on the effects of other factors; favorable conditions in site or soil factors can allow aspen to grow in unfavorable climate. This will be tested in using landscape patterns of aspen forests near their northern limit. We will use C and N isotopic signatures to better gain a better understanding of whether the distribution of aspen forests in changing with changing climate. Overall, the research will increase knowledge of the relative roles of climatic and non-climatic factors in determining the distribution of deciduous forest ecosystems in the north and will provide a better foundation for predicting the effects of climate change.","Climate and atmosphere","Evolution & Ecology"

"The goal of this research is to design simple chemical systems that reproduce and improve upon the membrane transport functions found in all cellular life.  In the last decade, this program has produced a wide array of new compounds and chemical systems that have reproduced many basic functions of natural ion channels.  It is now possible to design and prepare synthetic compounds that are as active as natural examples using simplified and rapid syntheses of ion channel candidates through conventional solution and solid-phase synthesis.  

The program of research proposed confronts both practical and fundamental challenges in the design and assembly of membrane transport systems.  The new syntheses have produced new classes of active compounds for mechanistic investigation and which will demonstrate new types of regulated ion transport.  In a parallel track, we have explored some examples in which ion channels have been formed through directed self-assembly of suitable components.  The channels produced are unprecedented, complex, and very challenging to study.  Whatever their structure(s), is clear now that the simple design ideas that motivated the initial effort are too na�ve.  We have developed thermodynamic simulations to analyze and predict how self-assembly processes occur in homogeneous solution, and propose extensions to deal with the energetic complexities encountered in the bilayer membrane phase.  On a technical level, we continue to develop techniques to handle and inject a few thousand channel-forming molecules into bilayer membranes.   The next practical target is a stabilized and supported bilayer membrane initially for our own use in the characterization of new transporters.  To the extent that this is successful, sensor applications will be possible.

"The present proposal involves different areas of modern Fourier analysis such as the theory of wavelets, Gabor systems and time -frequency analysis.  One important component of the research effort will involve the theory of both irregular Gabor and wavelet systems. A Gabor systems is a collection of functions used to  ""analyse"" a given signal. This collection is generated by shifts and modulations of a certain function called the ""window"".  The system is called  ""regular"" if these modulations and shifts are regularly  spaced in the time-frequency and ""irregular"" if they are not. While the theory of regular Gabor systems is well understood at the present, the same cannot be said for irregular systems. The applicant proposes to develop a better understanding of these irregular systems and improves on recent work he and others have done in this area.  One of the main advantages of our proposed approach  to irregular Gabor systems is that, instead of fixing, a priori, the set of sampling points in the time-frequency space and then trying to find windows that can be use effectively with the given sampling set, we fix the window (or pair of dual windows) and then try to find  a suitable sampling set in the time-frequency space.  Wavelet systems can  also be  generated by a single function, but through the use of shifts and dilations instead, and a notion of regular and irregular wavelet system can also be defined.  Again, the theory  of regular wavelet systems is fairly well developed at this point while that of irregular wavelet system is still in its infancy. We propose to investigate whether certain recent results of the applicant concerning irregular Gabor systems can be extended to irregular wavelet systems. Beside the theory of irregular Gabor and wavelet systems, this proposal also includes other topics such as the study of so-called density conditions  for subspace Gabor frames and the study of wavelet sets constructed using self-affine multi-tiles.

"Catecholamines are neurotransmitters found in both the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS). CNS catecholamines consist of dopamine (DA) and its two hydroxylated products, norepinephrine, and epinephrenine. DA constitutes approximately 80% of catecholamines in the brain and, via its effects on specific receptors, is an important neurochemical mediator in behaviours. Likewise, aberrations in DA activity have been implicated in abnormal behaviour. Importantly, DA's effect in these domains is activity dependent and tightly coupled to extracellular DA levels in the synapse. However, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate levels of DA. The proposed research program seeks to investigate the role of a 40kDa catecholamine regulating protein (CRP40) in governing DA levels and, in turn, DA-dependent behaviour.  This line of investigation is interesting given that my lab has shown that CRP40 is a multifunctional protein with catecholamine binding functions. Moreover, CRP40 may act as a scavenging molecule in the presence of excess DA activity. Arguably, these processes each represent potential components in the overall regulation of DA and bolster the suggestion that CRP40 has a fundamental impact on CNS DA levels and, consequently, DA-dependent behaviour. What is missing, however, are studies aimed at experimentally testing the impact of CRP40 manipulations on dopaminergic molecules causing alterations on DA concentrations, and DA-dependent behavior in order to elucidate these putative underlying relationships. The proposed approach in this research program will involve rat brain region specific knock-down of CRP40 mRNA in order to examine how the time-course of CRP40 knockdown and recovery is coupled to changes in several DA-dependent behaviours. Based on the hypothesis that CRP40 regulates DA activity, we predict that dysfunction and recovery of DA-dependent behaviours will follow the time-course of CRP40 protein recovery.

"Drinking water is a complex mixture of many thousands of naturally occurring and anthropogenic chemicals.  A large group of water contaminants have been identified and hazardous pollutants are regulated, but many currently unidentified chemicals in water could pose a threat to the environment and human health.  The identification and investigation of these emerging contaminants in water is the objective of our NSERC-funded research program.  For this purpose, we use powerful analytical techniques based on combining the technologies of Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC), Electrospray Ionization (ESI), High Field Asymmetric Waveform Ion Mobility Spectrometry (FAIMS), and Quadrupole-time-of-flight-Mass Spectrometry (QTOF-MS).  These techniques are capable of separating, detecting, and identifying chemical pollutants present in water even at sub-parts-per-billion concentrations in a quick and convenient fashion.  Using these unique analytical capabilities, we will investigate a group of recently discovered hydroxycarboxylic acids as well as N-nitrosamines and other nitrogen-containing emerging pollutants in drinking water in Ontario.  We will also evaluate bottled drinking water with respect to priority pollutants such as phthalic acid diesters (plasticizers), bisphenol A, and their degradation and chlorination products.  Our research will provide comprehensive information on formation, occurrence, fate, and environmental impact of investigated pollutants and improve the quality and safety of drinking water.

"Both scientific and socioeconomic global climate change research has focused mostly on scenarios of gradual shifts as suggested by Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models simulations. Due to their coarse resolution, such scenarios cannot be applied directly at the regional/local scale. Hence, regionalization techniques, i.e. Regional Climate Model (RCM) and statistical downscaling (SD) methods, are needed to develop high resolution climate scenarios at appropriate temporal and spatial scales relevant for impact studies. As the vulnerability of a system faced to climate change is strongly related to climate variability and, in particular, to the frequency and severity of extreme events, rather than to gradual changes in the average climate, assessing risks and uncertainties associated with climate extremes is needed. In this context, the main aim of the proposed research is therefore to support Canada's intensifying effort to understand how climate extremes will affect Canada's social, economic, and natural systems. The overall objective of the proposed research is to advance scientific knowledge on climate extremes and to improve society's ability to manage risks associated with potential changes of climate extremes at the regional/local scale, by creating and developing improved tools and methods for producing high-quality impact assessments. The proposed integrated approach is organized around three inter-related specific objectives on (1) the development of appropriate atmospheric variables (i.e. predictors) to improve the capacity of SD methods to simulate extremes and to link with the occurrence of extremes at the regional/local scale, (2) the incorporation into appropriate SD tools relevant predictors to allow the translation of large/regional scale climate variables into simulated extremes, and (3) the construction of reliable and consistent extreme climate scenarios for Canada from both RCM and SD tools. The suggested research will contribute to the reduction of uncertainties in climate scenarios developed at the regional/local scale, to the dissemination of high quality climate information in different research areas of environmental sciences, and to improve climate risk assessment studies.","Climate and atmosphere","Environmental Earth Sciences"
"The rapid technological developments in the fabrication processes of integrated circuits require efficient computer-aided design (CAD) tools to capture market windows in a timely manner. Large scale electronic product developments can only be facilitated with the availability of fast and accurate CAD tools to center the design optimally, enable first-pass success of novel idea and enhance the product yield. 



The proposed research program in this application identifies five areas of strategic importance to the Canadian CAD industry. The first one is the use of dynamic (as opposed to static) timing analysis of digital integrated circuits. Here, the proposed research program develops fast, stable and accurate paradigms for the solution of differential equations. The second area seeks to develop efficient methodologies for the design and analysis of wireless circuits operating in the radio-frequency range. The proposed scheme in this regard aims at expanding the scope of existing approaches to handle circuits represented by general formulation techniques. The third area addresses the coupling between electrometric fields and high-speed integrated circuits via full-wave analysis of interconnect circuit structures. The fourth and fifth areas represent the long-term component in the proposed research program, where the fourth one seeks to advance the use of reconfigurable hardware computing platforms in CAD applications and the fifth one aims at introducing the techniques used in CAD algorithms into the area of system biology.

"ALE APPLICATIONS IN BULK METAL FORMING PROBLEMS:

The ALE formulation has unique features that facilitate easier handling of highly nonlinear problems. Among these features are mesh adaptivity, ease of applying nonlinear boundary conditions. In this proposal we intend to expand our developed ALE formulation and in-house ALE program to applications in bulk metal forming problems such as back extrusion. We propose to use the ALE formulation with the Void of Fluid (VOF) approach in solving bulk metal forming problems. The objective is to eliminate the problem of mesh distortion and to easily handle the problem of free surface.

Inverse analysis is commonly used in various areas of engineering problems where boundary conditions and material properties are not fully known and may be partially determined by experimental measurements. Such problems are typically ill-posed and would normally be sensitive to the measurement errors. The objective of this part of the proposal is to investigate and to develop robust inverse algorithms for use in jet impingement cooling.

"An obstacle to future developments of computer software systems lies in their ever-increasing complexity. In a not-so-distant future, we will reach a state where the operation of these systems will be intractable for human experts. A solution to this has been proposed in the autonomic computing paradigm, which aims at developing computer software systems made of many interacting self-managing modules. This can be achieved in part through the use of open standards for service discovery and communication between modules. But autonomic computing also requires the injection of intelligence and robustness in the software systems, in order to free human operators from low-level details. Computational intelligence encompasses many techniques combining elements of learning, adaptation, evolution, and fuzziness. Using these techniques for the development of self-managing software systems looks promising, and will be explored within the context of the current research program.



Three main projects will be executed within the program: 1) designing a multiagent-based software architecture for autonomic computing; 2) exploiting reinforcement learning for enabling effective self-adaptation of software modules; and 3) investigating cooperation methods between modules for an efficient decentralized processing. These projects will be executed within the specific applicative context of monitoring different types of environments with wireless sensor networks. Sensor networks involve the use of miniaturized sensing devices for a robust distributed processing of information, with a sensing close to the phenomenon observed. These resources-constrained devices can greatly benefit from autonomic-based methods, as judiciously designed policies at the sensor level can lead to an efficient perception at the network level, while maximizing energetic autonomy.

"Concepts are mental entities that allow a person's experience with the world to be organized into meaningful units. �The ability to store and access conceptual information is vital to human cognition because many tasks that people perform on a daily basis (such as classification, prediction, reasoning, and communication) require the application of existing knowledge to new situations.  The long-term goal of my research program is to determine how relational information is stored in the conceptual system and to understand how such information influences the way people understand and use concepts. To do so, I have focused on conceptual combination, which is a process whereby new concepts are created by combining established concepts. For example, the concepts ""grass"" (the modifier) and ""cord"" (the head noun) can be combined to create the new concept ""grass cord"". The constituent concepts are linked by the MADE OF relation.

An important step toward this goal is to understand how combined concepts are stored in memory and to understand how the relations used to link the constituent concepts are structured. Therefore, the current research project has two aims. The aim of the first series of experiments is to systematically examine the ability of the modifier and head noun to serve as a retrieval cue for a modifier-noun phrase and, thereby, gain a better understanding of the way in which the mental representation for a combined concept is connected to other representations in the conceptual system. In addition, I will examine the ability of the linking relation to influence the retrieval of previously-encountered phrases. The aim of the second series of experiments is to determine whether relations exhibit a hierarchical structure in which general relations (e.g., HAS) are subcategorized into more detailed relations (e.g., HAS-PART and HAS-OWNERSHIP) and, if so, whether people make use of the subcategories during conceptual combination.",Psychology,"Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences"

"This project will aim to develop new, core technology for the treatment of produced water (PW) in offshore oil and gas applications. The current pplicable limit for hydrocarbons in PW discharges in Atlantic Canada is 40 mg/L  as a monthlty.   Offshore installations that commenced operations after August 2002 are required to meet a 30 mg/L monthly average of oil in discharged produced water. In contrast, oil concentration regulations for the instantaneous discharge of ship bilge water have long been established at 15 mg/L by the International Maritime Organization. The separation of dissolved oil in produced water is limited using conventional treatment technologies(e.g., hydrocyclones, gas flotation), and has been shown to contribute to its toxicity. Advanced treatment technologies to ensure regulations can be met from both a liquid effluent quality and solid waste management standpoint are required. The use of conventional coagulation (CC) through the additionof hydrolyzing metal salts has been investigated in the destabilisation of oil-in-water emulsions and has demonstrated to be critical to the removal of dissolved oils in downstream clarification processess such as dissolved air flotation (DAF).Chemical destabilization of oil-in-water emulsions can also beachieved through the use of electrocoagulation with in situ generation of coagulants by electrolyticoxidation of an appropriate anode material (e.g., iron or aluminum).

"In drinking water, biofilms can be engineered to remove natural organic material, inorganic matter and other chemical contaminants.  However, in distribution systems, high pressure membrane systems and other water treatment processes biofilms can result in increased head loss, be a source of unwanted microbial and/or chemical contaminants, and decrease water quality.  This research aims to discover new techniques and strategies to control biofilms in water treatment and distribution through fundamentally-based research that can be translated into practice. This research program has been divided into the following three focus areas. 



1) Disinfection of Pathogens in Distribution Systems.  Dr. Gagnon's research group has worked with several leading international researchers on this complex problem and will focus its efforts on chronic pathogen occurrence and we will use molecular tools and proteomics to identify mechanisms that allow pathogens to grow under sub-lethal disinfectant conditions. 



2)  Understanding the Interactions between Inorganic Contaminants and Biofilms in Distribution Systems.  While it is recognized that inorganic contaminants (e.g., arsenic) can be treated to below their reference levels at the plant but they are prone to accumulation in the distribution system.  Thus there is a need to develop a better understanding of the ability of biofilms to accumulate inorganic contaminants. 



3)  Biofilm Control in High-Pressure Membrane Systems.  Nanofiltration (NF) has demonstrated a great potential to mitigate disinfection by-products (DBPs) in the absence of additional chemical addition. This work will determine treatment strategies and/or chemical additives that can be used to mitigate biofilm formation on NF without compromising water quality goals and membrane integrity.

"The evolution of video-related information technologies (network bandwidth, personal camera, compression tools, disk capacity, displays, etc.) has pushed video as the primary medium for the capture, storage and presentation of visual information. Video is now replacing still images in many application areas like, for

instance, video surveillance and on-line Web advertising. From small clips to full feature-length films, digital videos are everywhere and often part of a larger multimedia digital library. As a result, the need for tools that can quickly browse and retrieve video content has increased and led to two major topics in modern computer vision: content-based video retrieval and video summarization.



The proposed research program targets video summarization. The objective is to develop and integrate multimodal analysis tools to segment a video into Logical Story Units (LSU) or scenes based on video elements like shots transitions, key-objects, key-faces, key-places as well as audio characteristics. This will be integrated into a LSU-based GUI, rather than the commun shot- or key-frame-based one, that will provide a graphical ToC to the user with the possibility to access parts of the video from it.

"Deaf and hearing impaired rely on caption to be informed and enjoy TV and videos. Skilled people (captioners) edit caption to establish accuracy, clarity and proper reading rate. Caption can be produced either on-line during the broadcast or off-line. For off-line captioning, captioners have to place caption based on their

assessment of the value of the visual information. Typically, they place the caption not too far from the source of speech (i.e. the speakers) and try not masking any visual element that may be relevant to the understanding of the content. This task can be labor-intensive and could require up to 18 hours to caption one hour of content.



This project aims at developing an intelligent tool to assist off-line captioners to reduce the production time by automatically suggesting a position for the captions on a number of consecutive frames using a set of production rules based on automatic visual content detection (faces, motion activity area, text, banners) and

"Marine coastal ecosystems are impacted by accelerating rates of species introductions, degradation of resources, pollution, and losses of habitats. Such forces, largely caused by human activity, alter the abundance of marine organisms and their interactions with the environment which makes it increasingly difficult to understand, manage, and predict changes in the structure and function of these ecologically and economically important ecosystems. This is true of the extensive shallow rocky subtidal ecosystems of Newfoundland and Labrador for which dynamics are poorly understood, yet presumably regulated by high physical harshness and altered by recent species introductions. My overall objective is to identify biotic and abiotic interactions that regulate the structure and function of these unique ecosystems. In particular, I will investigate how changes in environmental factors such as wave action, water temperature, and light affect the survival, behavior, and interactions (predation, competition, and facilitation) between dominant invertebrates, seaweeds, and fish (both native and invasive), and how these regulate population, community, and ecosystem patterns. My approach will combine laboratory and field experiments with organisms, as well as field surveys of populations and communities from below (scuba diving) and above (remote sensing) the sea surface. I have shown the utility of advanced remote sensing and GIS to map eastern Canada's shallow benthic species over large tracts of seabed. I will conduct further research to increase the accuracy and spatial scope of these methodologies to study subtidal ecosystems at broader spatial and temporal scales than is currently possible. The proposed research program will provide one of the first and most detailed studies of the causes and consequences of benthic patterns and processes in NL's subtidal rocky ecosystems, while increasing our global knowledge of subarctic marine ecosystems. By establishing procedures for broad scale ecology of subtidal benthos, I will also provide scientists and managers with the capacity to acquire novel ecological data that aid in understanding marine ecosystem functioning and conserving native biodiversity.","Oceans, seas and estuaries","Evolution & Ecology"

"Human activities, such as fossil fuel consumption and metal mining, have caused the environment to be increasingly contaminated with environmentally persistent toxic heavy metal and metalloid compounds. The anthropogenic emissions of these pollutants are likely to increase even further as populous countries, such as India and China will increase their fossil fuel consumption in order to improve their standard of living. The resulting exposure of humans to increasing dietary levels of inorganic and organic forms of arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury is therefore of much public concern. Toxicological studies have addressed the exposure of humans to these pollutants by studying the effect of single metals and metalloids in animals and have provided us with valuable data concerning their acute toxicity, such as the mechanism of toxicity and the mammalian target organs. Considerably less, however, is known about the molecular basis of the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of toxic metals and metalloid compounds in mammals. This must be attributed to the fact that biotransformations that occur after the absorption of a particular toxic metal or metalloid compound into the blood stream are poorly understood. Applying two advanced spectroscopic techniques, we will structurally characterize hitherto unknown metal and metalloid-containing metabolites which are formed in blood and are critically involved in the chronic toxicity of metals and metalloids and may be involved in human diseases, such as Parkinson's Disease and autism.This approach will allow us to better define the effect of multiple metal and metalloid exposure on human health. In addition, this research will reveal important mammalian detoxification mechanisms which are the key to develop a treatment against the chronic toxicity of metals and metalloid compounds which currenty affects millions of people.

"I propose to investigate the evolution of equity-indexed annuity (EIA) portfolios as well as their associated risk management. An equity-indexed annuity is an insurance product whose benefits are linked to the performance of an equity market. It provides limited participation in the performance of an equity index (e.g. S&P 500) while guaranteeing a minimum rate of return.  Introduced by Keyport Life Insurance Co. in 1995, equity-indexed annuities have been the most innovative insurance product introduced in recent years. They have become increasingly popular since their debut and their sales have broken the $20 billion barrier ($23.1 billion) in 2004, reaching $27.3 billion in 2005. Since equity-indexed annuities have reached a critical mass with a total asset of $93 billion in 2005, I propose to investigate a global approach that evaluates the dynamic evolution of these portfolios in a realistic framework.



Equity-indexed annuities usually incorporate some death, surrender, and accumulation guarantees that protect policyholders. The costs of these guarantees are evaluated based on financial and actuarial models.



I am primarily interested in the application of the ""Greeks"" to the risk management of EIA portfolios. The Greeks measure the portfolio's sensitivity with respect to some financial parameters. Each Greek considers a different aspect of the risk and provides the position to hold in underlying financial instruments in order to reduce the financial risks of portfolios. The Greeks are well known in risk management and I would like to extend their applications to equity-indexed annuity portfolios.

In this research program, we use a paleoclimate approach to quantify past climate variability and its impact on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. We document natural climate variability of the past 10,000 years, determine factors that cause the climate to change and illustrate how these climate changes impacted Arctic ecosystems. 



From the Canadian Arctic, we collect lake sediment cores, and provide high-resolution paleoclimate series from the central and western Arctic. We analyze fossil pollen extracted from the cores to understand how the vegetation responded to past climate changes. We study fossils of aquatic organisms (algae and plankton) to see how the lake ecosystem has evolved in response to climate variability. In the Yukon and northern Quebec, we are investigating how climate variability and extreme events are impacting the boreal forest. For example, we can reconstruct changes in fire frequency through time, and thus suggest how past climate changes, for example drought, affected fire behaviour, which had a significant impact on forest composition (and will in the future).



As more sites are analyzed, we use networks of these sites to map how the climate has changed across all of Canada. These results indicate the magnitude and rate of climate change across the entire country, and illustrate the evolution of Canadian ecosystems through time.

"As anyone who has gone through puberty, pregnancy, menopause or andropause can attest, hormones exert powerful effects over our brains and body.  Estrogen, particularly the abundant ""youthful"" estrogen, estradiol, can exert profound effects on both brain and behaviour.  There is a lot of controversy surrounding the use of estrogens to promote cognition in older women, likely due to conflicting reports in the literature.  We have recently found that estradiol affects learning differentially depending on the type of task (and indeed the brain region required to perform the task) and the dose of estradiol administered to female rodents. High levels of estradiol impair both working (memory that changes from trial to trial, i.e. where you park your car) and reference memory (memory that stay stable over time, i.e where the parking lot is), while low levels of estradiol facilitate working memory via the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus albeit at different doses.  These findings suggest that estradiol has a positive dose-dependent effect on learning in different brain regions that are involved in working memory (prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) but may have a detrimental effect on brain regions that are involved in reference memory (hippocampus, caudata) and conditioned place preference (amygdala).

    )	In this proposal I plan to study how estradiol affects learning and memory; in particular, which brain regions, and by which mechanisms, does estradiol exert it's effects on learning and memory.  I plan to investigate these hypotheses using pharmacological and histological methods: including infusions of estradiol into different brain areas to determine at which sites estrogen exerts its actions; determining which particular type of estrogen receptor (alpha or beta) that might be involved in estradiol's effects on different types of learning and memory; and the mechanism by which estradiol interacts with other hormones and neurochemical messengers to exert its' effects on cognition.  Understanding how hormones such as estradiol can influence cognition, may lead to a better understanding of how learning and memory is organized in the brain.

"The present proposal is for three collaborative projects involving social learning in animals:

     1.  Kevin Laland (St. Andrew University) and I will be using social learning about foods in threespine sticklebacks as an empirical system to test predictions from formal models as to when animals should increase reliance on social relative to individual learning and whom the na�ve should select as models.  Studies of sticklebacks will directly parallel a project just completed in my laboratory using Norway rats' social learning about foods to test predictions from formal models.  We will be examining the generality of our previous finding that formal models are far more accurate in predicting when animals will learn socially than from whom they will learn.  If our results replicate in a second empirical system, the need for  changes in the modelling of social learning strategies will be indicated.

     2.  David White (University of Pennsylvania) and I will be extending my laboratory's explorations of social influences on mate choice in Japanese quail.  We will use television images to explore the possibility that female quail make cryptic, postcopulatory mate-choice decisions and investigate: (1)  the relative investment of female quail in eggs fertilized by preferred and non-preferred males and (2) the viability of young with preferred and non-preferred sires.

     3.  John Ratcliffe (Memorial University of Newfoundland) and I will examine the role of carbon disulfide in the evolution of sulfur-containing scents emitted by bat-pollinated plants, but not by plants pollinated by insects or birds.  Carbon disulfide is a constituent of the breath of both Norway rats and nectar-feeding bats, and exposure to a food odour together with carbon disulfide increases subsequent attractiveness of a food to both Norway rats and fruit-eating bats. We will test the hypothesis that bat-pollinated plants are using mammals' sensory bias to consume foods experienced on the breath of others of their species to increase  the attractiveness of their nectar to potential pollinators.

"A particularly promising line of research in the context of sustainable energy systems is the design and

operation of Trans-Canadian (TC) electricity grids in an integrated manner. The notion of a national or of a set

of segmented power grids covering the country and linking all regions is not a reality at present for technical

and political reasons. However, as this research proposes to assess, by exploiting diversity across provincial

jurisdictions, the advantages of integrated TC grids may have a major impact on policy and, eventually, on

long-term system planning and short-term operational decisions for the whole of Canada. Integrated TC grids

would then be designed and operated as entities with shared common goals, a significant departure from the

existing collection of independent and weakly collaborating grids. As described in this proposal, the potential

benefits of such an approach could be to facilitate the penetration of sustainable energy systems and

conservation schemes, to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels thereby decreasing green house gas emissions, to

stimulate transmission expansion thus raising reliability, as well as to reduce the overall capital and operational

costs nationwide.

"This research deals with the operation and planning of large-scale electric power systems.  One concern is how high levels of reliability, traditionally a centrally administered and planned task, can be maintained in the current context of independently run competing entities whose primary goal is their individual profit. This question applies to both operation in the short-term and to long-term planning tasks. In the phase of the research related to electricity markets, we will examine how to identify excessive market power on the part of generating companies. Mechanisms to restrict market power will be studied such as new electricity pricing rules, limiting the size of the competing entities, demand elasticity and price caps. One particularly challenging problem is to understand how transmission congestion and multiple product markets (e.g. power and reserve)affect market power. A second issue to be researched here is that of integrating storage facilities and renewable resources such as wind power into electricity grids. We will examine the impact of such integration on system reliability, reserve needs and on economic measures such as prices, profits and associated risks.

"This research concerns the analysis and identification of control systems undergoing sudden parametric changes, to enable selection of alternate control schemes. Such systems exist in many physiological contexts,e.g., those used by the brain to control movement. Since usual assumptions of constant characteristics (stationarity) are violated, special algorithms are required to allow consistent estimation of system dynamics in the presence of sudden parametric changes and variable initial conditions.

Hence, the first part of this research addresses the issue of developing software tools in MATLAB modules for easy distribution, which will have 2 purposes. First, fast classification of a system's response modes into potential configurations, using reduced models. Second, fitting system models to each of the potential modes using identification methods which take into account short response segments and variable initial conditions. Results here are finding direct application in CIHR funded research on clinical diagnosis and modelling of binocular control.

The second major component examines the strategies deduced from the modelling of physiological motor control (CIHR supported work) and is porting so-deduced novel strategies to robot orientation systems and sensory fusion issues. For example, we have successfully implemented fast target pursuit in a binocular system using dynamic mode switching, and can coordinate motion of a supporting ""neck"" without additional controllers. The biologially-evoked approach offers the promise of faster and more accurate control, despite structurally simple controllers. Complex behaviour relies on internal switching which of course introduces non-linearities which must be addressed in the design and analysis aspects of the projects. This is being extended to allow innovative methods of sensory fusion and 'reflex' adaptation with context in both robotic heads and arms.

"Supermassive black holes are not independent entities, but grow as luminous quasars during an epoch when their host galaxies are also forming the bulk of their stars.  The beautiful empirical correlations found between host galaxy properties and black hole masses indicate a relationship between these evolutionary events. It is remarkable that these two phenomena are linked at all; the black hole sphere of influence is on scales of parsecs while galaxies are measured in units a thousand times larger.  As the growth of supermassive black holes cannot be fully understood independent of the evolution of their host galaxies, my overall research program focuses on the intersection of these phenomena.  I am addressing this cosmological issue with the following projects:



(1) Characterizing Nuclei in Compact Galaxy Groups: These local, dense environments are prime testbeds for evaluating the influence of galaxy interactions on nuclear activity.



(2) Understanding Quasar Feedback: The intersection of theory and observations of quasars with outflows seen in absorption offers insight into both accretion physics and the mechanism for regulating coeval black hole and galaxy evolution.



(3) Investigating Luminosity Effects on Quasar Spectral Energy Distributions:  Multiwavelength studies of accreting black holes at luminosity extremes probe the effect of power on accretion physics.   



These three projects combined will offer insight into the relationship of black hole growth to galaxy evolution over a range of timeframes and physical scales.

".    Computation procedures are needed to estimate losses of sediment, pesticides and nutrients from agricultural fields to surface water. The long-term objective of the proposed research is to develop an improved contaminant load calculation procedure for agricultural watersheds. Geostatistics can be used to obtain accurate load estimates. The short-term objective of this research is to develop and validate a geostatistical model to improve the calculation of sediment and nutrient loads. The originality of the proposed research resides in the development of a load calculation procedure using kriging techniques and  statistical relationships that have not, so far, been used at their full potential.   

     The work will be limited to two small watersheds of 5.7 and 70 sq. km. For both watersheds, work will be done with three types of concentration and flow data: historical data, data measured during the project, and data simulated by a hydrological/water quality model (HSPF). Geostatistics have not been examined thoroughly as a tool to estimate load. The proposed research is to study two contaminants that exhibit completely different behaviors in relation to their transport characteristics: sediment (insoluble) and nitrogen (soluble). The experimental procedure includes: 1) automated water measurement; 2) calibration of HSPF; 3) generation of synthetic data; 4) analysis of flow-contaminant data; 5) determination of the most appropriate kriging model; 6) calculation of the true load based on synthetic data generated at a small time interval, and stochastic simulations of load using kriging.

     Pollution of water from agriculture is an important issue. Load estimation is the primary tool for determining trends in water quality. Nowadays, load estimation requires many samples and are prohibitive. This research will result in less expensive estimates of contaminant loads, and will benefit to the society in terms of human health and reduced costs to the health care system.

"How does material fall into a black hole?  What is the material falling into a black hole made of?  How close does it get to the black hole before it disappears?  Do black holes spin?  We live in a unique era in that we can now attempt to answer such questions based on observations, not theory.  X-rays are emitted from the regions closest to black holes, where temperatures and conditions are most extreme.  By studying the X-ray variability and spectral properties of supermassive black holes, known as active galactic nuclei, we can decipher what the environment nearest the black hole looks like.  The proposed plan is to observe active galaxies with X-ray telescope at various epochs over the course of years.  Characterising the behaviour of the black holes on short (e.g hourly) and long (e.g. month-years) time scales will reveal their intrinsic properties.

"The eradication of pathogenic infection is accomplished by the activation of immune responses in individuals.  Although beneficial, the aberrant activation of these responses may cause deleterious consequences which can ultimately be detrimental. These immune responses are mediated by factors named cytokines which are produced predominately by white blood cells of the immune system.  One such factor, named High Mobility Group Box1 (HMGB1), as recently been shown to play a pronominal role in the pathogen induced immune response.  The generation of protein from DNA requires the synthesis of an intermediate molecule named RNA. RNA thus serves as a template from which DNA genes are converted into proteins. The generation of protein from RNA is mediated by proteins named RNA binding proteins.  Our laboratory is working on an RNA binding protein named HuR and our preliminary data indicate that this protein is involved in the regulation of HMGB1 mRNA.  The purpose of this proposal is to identify all sequences in the HMGB1 mRNA mediating its expression in white blood cells and determine consequently the network of RNA binding proteins which, in addition to HuR, regulate the expression of HMGB1.  Determining the mechanisms through which these RNA binding proteins regulate the HMGB1 mRNA may enable the identification of identify potential anti-inflammatory compounds which may lower the morbidity and mortality associated to exuberant cytokine production.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","Cell Biology"

"Discussion about lice, fleas and ticks typically causes people to cringe with disgust. However, parasites constitute a great proportion of animal species, and have considerable potential to impact fitness and performance in wildlife, domestic animals and humans. When I started my work, there were fewer than 300 species of chewing lice recorded in Canada, many of which were misidentified and associated with incorrect host species.  There was little information on infestation parameters.  I have recorded more than 300 species of lice from Manitoba, alone, and examined nearly 7000 individual hosts of nearly 300 species.  By examining hosts salvaged from wildlife rehabiltation centres, I have compiled a database on host specificity, prevalence and intensity of infestation, sex ratios, and population structure for each species of louse. 

     The objectives of my research are to use a comparative method to examine patterns in infestation parameters and host relationships across the many different hosts, predominately using the data on lice.  I have used consistent collection protocols and a method whereby all active stages of lice are retained so that the nature of the louse population on each host can be compared among host taxa.  The comparative method is valuable in construction of hypotheses related to the evolutionary ecology of these ectoparasites, and in some cases can by used conservatively to test general ecological hypotheses.  For example, from work in the neotropics, it has been suggested that male-biased sex ratios are more prevalent among amblyceran lice, where lice are more mobile and capable of dispersing more effectively to new hosts, than is the case among ischnoceran lice. Are such skewed sex ratios as prevalent in populations of lice on birds in temperate regions and are there similar relationships between amblyceran and ischnoceran lice? As host populations come increasingly under threat, it is imperative that we understand their parasite communities, in the interests of conservation of hosts and parasites.

Ports along the St-Lawrence sea way dredge over 200 000 ton/year of contaminated sediments and numerous Canadian lakes suffer from early (anthropogenic) eutrophication associated to phosphorus released from sediments with consequent production of toxic algae (cyanobacteria). Similar situations are found in US, Mexico and Europe making of contaminated soils and sediments a worldwide and serious environmental problem. Pollution problems have arisen from the inadequate disposal of industrial effluents, polluted urban/agricultural runoffs and hazardous waste storage that contaminated water/sediments in rivers/lakes; or soils/groundwater in contaminated sites. Pollutants considered retained by soils/sediments pose risk to ecosystems and human health because of mechanisms that trigger their release. Typical contaminants found in soil/sediments are: excess nutrients (P and N), heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cr, Zn), petroleum hydrocarbons and of recent/higher concern, road de-icing salts. The global aim of this research program is to understand a pollution problem holistically and to propose technical means to attenuate; protect, and restore sites following sustainable development principles. Specifically, 3 aspects of contaminated soil/sediments remediation will be studied in laboratory using field samples from real case studies: 1) study of contaminant behaviour with emphasis on the influence of common anionic contaminants in the mobilization of heavy metals, physical distribution and potential for transport; 2) relation between geochemical speciation and availability, transformation and aging process; 3) Conception and design of geo-liners for the treatment or isolation of contaminants; the barriers are to be technically and environmentally sound/tested in laboratory at meso/large columns and they will mimic real case studies within watershed or hydrogeological systems.

"During the last five years of NSERC granting we have made two promising discoveries. The first was the realization of the ability of a simple pyridine based ligand system to store a large amount of spin density. In turn, this has allowed preparing several complexes with the appearance of low-valent species. In reality though, these complexes contain higher valent metals coupled to reduced ligands in their radical anionic form. Yet, the chemical reactivity remained unquenchded.

The second point was the realization that the bonding mode (?- versus ?-) of the pyrrolide anion, isolelectronic with the Cp anion, may be controlled by the coordination of Lewis acids to the sp2-N atom. This possibility had remarkable repercussions on the reactivity of the metal which, by adopting a type of zwitterionic type of electronic configuration, confers hemilability to the coordination mode of the ligand. During the process, reactive functions may shuttle from the ligand directly onto the metal center rendering the reaction irreversible. 

We wish now to combine these two features and build on them. Namely we wish to develop novel ligand systems, electronically flexible and sterically hemilabile for the preparation of novel low-valent complexes with which to target molecular activation of important molecules such as N2 and CO2","Energy storage and conversion","Inorganic & Organic Chemistry"

"Climate change and disturbance are altering the composition and function of terrestrial ecosystems.  Northern ecosystems, including tundra and boreal forests, are particularly affected due to warming and drying of the surface and increased exposure to drought, fire and insect damage.  Wide-scale human disturbance, including timber harvesting and oil sands extraction, provide additional perturbations to vast boreal regions.  While we understand the general direction of change, many functional details and their full implications for larger earth system processes remain unclear. For example, terrestrial ecosystems exert critical ""feedbacks"" on atmospheric composition and climate, and these feedbacks are changing as surface composition shifts, yet accurate quantification of these effects remain elusive(1). Due to the isolation and enormous extent of northern terrestrial ecosystems, we face tremendous sampling challenges that hinder our understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of these changes in these vast regions.  Fortunately, emerging technologies now offer the potential for a greater understanding of both the pace and significance of change in northern ecosystems.  Remote sensing and automated monitoring - coupled with careful experiments, field measurements, and models - will be essential to addressing these issues.  This proposal examines these new technologies and outlines a strategy for applying these novel methods to improve our understanding of ecosystem change in the North.","Advancement of knowledge","Environmental Earth Sciences"

"Until recently, Internet routers were widely believed to need large buffers. Commercial routers today have huge packet buffers, often storing millions of packets, under the assumption that large buffers lead to good statistical multiplexing and hence efficient use of expensive long-haul links. Recently, we (while at Stanford) showed that one can build a network with much smaller buffers still---with only a few dozen packet buffers in each router, at the expense of 100% link utilization. There are interesting practical consequences if this is correct. It could remove one major roadblock to building optical packet-switched routers. Recent advances in technology (at UCSB) also make possible optical FCFS packet buffers that can hold a few dozen packets in an integrated opto-electronic chip; larger all-optical buffers remain infeasible.



We are interested in exploring the feasibility of an operational all-optical network with just a few dozen optical packet buffers in each router, and studying the boundary conditions where our theoretical results hold. Previous attempts in this direction include experiments performed in limited laboratory settings. Limited number of routers and switches (usually one or two), fixed traffic patterns, trivial dumbbell-shaped topologies, ... are a few of the shortcomings of such experiments. In this project, we propose a broader set of experiments to explore the boundaries of the validity of our buffer sizing results. To this end, we are going to use 4-port Gigabit Ethernet routers, called Controllable and Observable Buffer (COB) routers, recently designed in Stanford University. COB routers are built on the NetFPGA platform, have configurable buffer sizes, and are able to monitor and report the buffer occupancy with a time resolution of 16ns (less than the arrival time of one packet). This will allow us more control and observability than any commercial router, in addition to the possibility of building large topologies of COB routers in our lab. Furthermore, a NetFPGA system is significantly cheaper than a commercial router, allowing us to build large topologies of COB routers in our lab.","Computer communications","Computing and Information Sciences - A"

"String theory is our best hope for a `theory-of-everything' in physics.

How accurately string theory actually describes the universe is still

completely uncertain, but its impact on mathematics is clear, and arguably

unparalleled in history.



My interest is in studying the mathematics -- in particular the algebra 

and number theory -- inspired by string theory. Instead of string

theory itself, I work with a more or less equivalent theory called

conformal field theory, because it's much more accessible algebraically

(where it is known as a vertex operator algebra). The impact on number 

theory of conformal field theory is still largely undeveloped though 

expected to be profound.



Canadians have already featured prominently in aspects of this.

For example, John McKay discovered a bridge (called Moonshine) between 

two seemingly unrelated areas: certain algebraic symmetries, and `modular 

functions' (i.e. functions which live on surfaces). Our best understanding 

of Moonshine interprets it using conformal field theories. Robert Moody 

co-discovered what are now called Kac--Moody algebras; perhaps their 

most important realisation is as symmetries of certain very special string 

theories. I am very interested in both these aspects.

"Knowledge of the mechanisms of translation of the genetic code is essential to understand growth and development, signal transduction and the mechanisms of antibiotic action, viral progression and oncogenesis.

      We have discovered a number of proteins essential to the process and aim to understand the mechanisms underlying the reactions dependent on two elongation factors, EF-P and RbbA ( ribosome bound ATPase).  EF-P stimulates peptide bond synthesis by accommodating the initiator-tRNA into the P-site of the 70S ribosome. RbbA ejects deacyl-tRNA from the ribosome after peptide bond synthesis. The structure of the proteins bound to ribosomes will be determined first by Cryo-EM of complexes with bound EF-P or RbbA in the presence or absence of  non- hydrolysable  analogues of GTP or ATP and of mutants defective in translational accuracy.

    Very recently it has been reported that ribosomes can move backwards relative to the mRNA in response to  translocation errors.  We have early evidence that a nucleoprotein, the Editron, that we isolated hydrolyses  fMet-tRNA and short chain peptidyl-tRNAs and may salvage the ribosome from  translocation errors.

     We will study the structure of the Editron by Cryo-EM and we will clone and sequence the RNA and proteins that comprise its structure .  Their function will be studied mutagenically.

     Proteins of known sequence, eg, insulin, interferon, etc. are synthesized in vitro with a large number of errors, mitigating their usefulness. The work we intend to do will help approach the goal of accurately synthezing proteins in vitro. More importantly, it will help understand translation control mechanisms in health and disease states.

"Recent trends in data networks employ service overlays to provide virtual private networks to customers. For example, Virtual Private LAN Services (VPLS) employ traffic engineering methods using MPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching) to connect various sites of a given customer ensuring Quality of Service. Our research focusses on efficient means of transporting traffic, called  traffic bundling on MPLS networks and efficient provisioning of these overlay networks with Quality of service guarantees. Our research conitnues to focus on newer flexible service models (e.g., Hose model and variants) to provision these networks with Quality of Service guarantees. 



For traffic applications, we focus on how to incorporate simple designs in the backbone routers for network wide spam detection with only packet-by-packet inference. Today's networks mostly detect spam, viruses and other malicious network usage through dedicated end systems. High speed backbone routers generally do not employ much intelligence to counteract these as most of the detection techniques involve huge storage, processing requirements to store transit messages and context. With the distributed classification and aggregation techniques, simple spam detection methods were developed that can be easily incorporated into high speed router design. The goal of this research is to enhance and look into methods that incorporate detection of network malicious usage and network attacks through traffic anomalies and feature detection in high capacity routers.

"Most contaminants in secondary industrial effluents (for example, effluents from petroleum refineries and pulp and paper mills) and membrane concentrate (which includes the contaminants blocked by the membranes, cleaning solutions and backwash water) from reverse osmosis and nanofiltration plants are in the dissolved form, some also contain toxic compounds. Currently, most membrane plants directly discharge the concentrate into surface water or sanitary sewers. Advanced treatment with multiple stage pretreatment processes is required to remove dissolved solids and evaporation or incineration is often the only choice for some wastewater residue/sludge volume reduction and disposal. High operating and capital cost and complex operations associated with these advanced treatment options limit their practical applications. Freeze concentration, due to its unique ability to remove dissolved impurities, reduce waste volume without addition of any chemicals and pretreatment, also recover a pure water stream, has great application potentials in these areas. Unlike the conventional suspension crystallization method, progressive freeze concentration (PFC) requires simplified operating system for separation of ice crystals from the feed water, thus can substantially reduce the process cost. However, no systematic investigation has yet been carried out on the mechanism of concentration efficiency in PFC and little information is available for engineering design of PFC processes for wastewater treatment. Laboratory experiments will be undertaken through this research program to: (1) investigate the freezing characteristics of selected wastewaters and membrane concentrate and their influence on PFC, (2) determine the impurity removal efficiency, toxicity reduction, and the capacity of volume reduction by PFC, (3) examine the effect of mechanical agitation, power ultrasound on impurity removal and waste volume reduction, (4) investigate the benefits of PFC on removal of microorganisms, and (5) study impurity distribution in ice. The results of this study are expected to provide new insight into the mechanisms of impurity separation by PFC and better design of the PFC systems for wastewater treatment.

"In the presence of complicated dependency structure and large dimensionality of the parameter space, it is often prohibitively difficult to apply traditional statistical methods on complex biological data. In this proposal, we aim to conduct theoretical investigations on how to develop statistical inference methods and model selection approaches especially designed for high-dimensional correlated data. As the exact likelihood of the full data is often computationally intractable, composite likelihood method (Lindsay, 1988, Cox and Reid, 2004, Varin and Vidoni, 2005, etc) has been proposed as an alternative way to describe the data using a combination of valid likelihood objects defined on different subsets of the data. In the presence of missing observations, we propose to develop a new COMP-EM algorithm in which each log likelihood object takes separate conditional expectation based on the observed data in the corresponding subset. When sample sizes are small, a useful alternative approach to the maximum likelihood approach is to add a prior distribution for the parameters and compute the posterior distribution of the parameters of interest. We propose to introduce the concept of composite posterior distribution analogous to the definition of the usual composite likelihood and investigate the theoretical properties of the multiple imputation technique and the modified Bayesian Information Criterion under the composite Bayes framework. With regard to the potential application, we will investigate how to employ the proposed methodologies developed above to analyze probabilistic models for gene network construction. To further determine the best network topology, we need to employ valid model selection criteria based on the composite likelihood. In conclusion, this project of modelling high-dimensional biological data involves not only methodological investigations on various statistical problems but also aims at providing new statistical tools for analyzing challenging biological problems.

"Due to the insatiable demand for additional user performance and applications, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is currently under rapid development. This includes the GPS modernization, the reconstitution of the GLONASS system, and the new Galileo system currently under development. A global differential GNSS (GDGNSS) positioning system has been proposed in this research which applies globally valid GNSS satellite orbit and clock corrections to conduct real-time precise position determination at centimeter to decimeter level using a single GNSS receiver. In addition to several significant advantages compared to other differential positioning techniques in terms of operational flexibility and cost-effectiveness, the proposed system can significantly improve the availability and reliability of current GPS-only global differential positioning systems. The major research tasks to be conducted include: a) investigation of the error/bias source in GPS, GLONASS and Galileo observations; b) analysis of the quality and error characteristics of precise GNSS products; c) development of global differential GNSS positioning methods and algorithms; d) investigation of fast position convergence and ambiguity resolution techniques; e) investigation of inertial aided GDGNSS positioning enhancement; and f) system implementation and performance analysis.



The proposed research is new in the field and the proposed global differential GNSS positioning system is expected to result in measurable impact to GNSS applications and the future precise positioning technology development. The proposed research will also accelerate the commercial development of such system and create many new applications using GNSS as a result of the significant improvement in system availability and reliability.

"It is a widely-held belief among many researchers in algorithmics and artificial intelligence that there remains a lack of theory on the nature of various computationally-hard algorithmic problems in practical fields. The worst-case oriented theory of computational complexity, while having had an enormous impact to the computing world, has proven to be unsatisfactory for providing the much-needed insight into the behavior of many  practical algorithms when applied to ""typical"" instances of real-world problems. In recent years, several new paradigms have emerged to help improve our ability to  cope with the intractability of  hard algorithmic problems.  Among them are probabilistic analysis such as the study of phase transitions and the smoothed analysis of specific algorithms, the theory of parameterized complexity and algorithms, and the theory of exact (exponential-time) algorithms.



I am particularly interested in the probabilistic analysis of intractable problems, the study of algorithmic aspects of random discrete structures, and the design of algorithms and heuristics. The insights learned from these studies have enormous application to problems in practical domains such as bioinformatics and networking. The proposed research program has two closely-related foci: (1) the probabilistic analysis of random instances of intractable problems; and (2) the design of theory-motivated heuristics and speedup techniques for search-tree-based  algorithms and the development of practical industrial-strength software solvers for hard problems.



Progress made by the success of this research program will help bridge the gap between the theoretical development of algorithmics and the practice of designing efficient algorithmic solutions to real-world problems.

"Kac-Moody algebras were developed by Victor Kac and Robert Moody in the late 1960's. Since then, Kac-Moody algebras and their quantum groups have been studied intensively and shown to be powerful tools in both mathematics and physics.



My main research interests include the structure and representation theory of some generalized versions of Kac-Moody Lie algebras and their quantum groups, in particular, the extended affine Lie algebras and quantized toroidal algebras. Extended affine Lie algebras form a new class of infinite dimensional Lie algebras, which were first introduced by mathematical physicists as a higher nullity generalization of the finite dimensional simple Lie algebras (being nullity zero) and the affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras (being nullity one). Toroidal Lie algebras are examples of extended affine Lie algebras. There are many extended affine Lie algebras which allow not only the Laurent polynomial algebra but also quantum tori and the other non-associative tori as coordinate algebras. Representation theory for both extended affine Lie algebras and some of their quantizations is a promising field of research in possible connection with the higher dimensional conformal field theory. It is also important on its own as it may lead some new phenomena and applications like Kac-Moody algebras and their quantum groups did in last 40 years.



Discovering more interesting representations for both extended affine Lie algebras and their quantum groups is one of our primary tasks.

"The proposed study concerns propagation of fluid-driven or hydraulic fractures in reservoir rock. These fractures, created by pumping a viscous fluid from a wellbore, are widely used to increase production from gas and oil bearing rock, and considered a viable mechanism to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by injecting them into underground formations. Pre-existing fractures (bedding planes, joints, faults, and pre-existing fracture networks) ubiquitous in reservoir rock often play defining role in hydraulic fracture propagation. This research will improve understanding of this role, and provide novel theoretical, computational, and experimental tools for hydraulic fracture modeling.



The primary focus of the proposed research program will be on providing fundamental understanding of the hydraulic fracture interaction with discontinuities in rock, as well as, developing of the essential theoretical and computational modeling tools, corroborated by laboratory experiments, for accurate prediction of the evolving hydraulic fracture path, width, and extent. 



It is expected that application of this work will be in design of 

(i) effective hydraulic fracturing treatments of naturally-fractured or layered petroleum reservoirs, and 

(ii) safe process of CO2 sequestration into monolithic or naturally-fractured geological layers. Propagation of hydraulic fractures outside of a targeted geological layer or reservoir may lead to dire economic and environmental consequences, such as, in the case of CO2 injection, hazardous escape of the carbon dioxide to the adjacent rock strata or to the surface.

"Concurrent systems present special design challenges due to their complex interactions, both with their environment, as in the case of reactive real-time systems, and internally in terms of synchronization and communication among their components. Such systems are encountered in diverse contexts -- single computers, distributed systems, or embedded systems with hardware and software components -- and some are safety-critical, that is, failures can endanger human life. Conventional design techniques are unable to insure that these systems will perform as expected when stimulated by inputs, and that they will not deadlock.

     Formal methods, which involve writing the specifications for a system's behaviour using a mathematically rigourous notation, have been advocated as a way to verify system properties with the help of model-checking programs. However, industry practitioners have not been eager to adopt abstruse mathematical notations, uncommon programming languages, or additional costly engineering process steps. These approaches are also of limited value when the formal specifications have to be translated by hand into a common programming language, since the verified properties may be lost in the conversion.

     This research makes the use of the algebraic formal method known as CSP, or Communicating Sequential Processes, more practical. System specifications written in CSP notation can be verified by means of a commercial model-checking program, then, using our design automation software, automatically translated into C++ and compiled into a running program. Additional components written in C++ can be ""plugged into"" the system's CSP control structure. The designer selectively applies the CSP formalism to critical portions of the system, leaving the non-critical portions to be written in C++, a popular programming language, by programmers without special training. This approach, called CSP++, will make it easier to design and implement reliable concurrent systems. We are extending CSP++ to allow controlling of digital hardware components, and to give the option of formally developing selected software components using B-Method.","Computer software","Computing and Information Sciences - A"

"Distributed, Embedded and Real-Time Systems (DERTS) are becoming more important to our everyday life. Examples include command and control systems, aircraft aviation systems, robotics, and nuclear power plant systems. However, the development and testing of such systems is difficult and takes more time than for systems without real-time constraints or with a non-embedded nature.



Software testing is the most popular and practical means of ensuring software quality in real-life applications. In spite of its viability, however, inadequacies in software testing account for an economic loss of 22-60 billion dollars per year in the United States alone. Instead of testing software in an ad-hoc fashion, more systematic and effective approaches are required.



Model-based software testing generally refers to test case generation and result evaluation based on structural and behavioral models of the target software. It provides a more rigorous and scientific way to tackle the issue. System behaviors are predicted by the models and tested and verified via the test cases generated. 



This proposal focuses on testing, analysis and quality assurance of software systems with an emphasis on DERTS's. Our goal is to devise software testing and analysis techniques to help engineers build high quality DERTS's. In this proposal, we aim to investigate software testing, analysis and quality assurance techniques which are based on the UML (Unified Modeling Language) models of a system under analysis.

"The main theme of this grant proposal is the use of high-precision spectroscopy, using novel detectors and state-of-the-art facilities, to probe exotic nuclear structure near the line of stability and at the extremes of neutron-to-proton ratios. This grant research will focus on three main areas: 1) studies related to fundamental symmetries and physics beond the Standard Model, 2) studies of collective states in spherical and deformed

nuclei to understand the structure of matter, and 3) development of advanced detectors for use at modern radioactive ion beam facilities that will allow nuclei at the extremes of neutron-to-proton ratios to be studied.



The study of fundamental symmetries and the search for physics beyond the Standard Model is one of the main goals of modern physics. We use the techniques of very-high-precision measurements of Fermi super-allowed beta-decay for these tests, and these are complemented by measurements at other facilities. We will continue our very successful programme of study of collective excitations in nuclei, concentrating on vibrational nuclei and those in a shape transitional region.  By studying collective excitations, we seek to understand how the motion of a many-body system of strongly interacting fermions organizes into a coherent one hat often displays very simple patterns.  We use the most advanced facilities in the world in order to perform this research, including laboratories in Canada, the US, and Europe.  The third main thrust of this research the development of new, advanced radiation detection systems, such as the DESCANT array - a novel, neutron-detector array based on deuterated liquid scintillator funded by CFI for $1.8M - that will open up new avenues for research.

"Complex systems with interacting components frequently give rise to `emergent properties', or pattern formation phenomena. Models for pattern formation are ubiquitous in biology and are an intensive area of research. An important class of models are reaction-diffusion equations (RDEs). RDEs have been used to model many biological pattern phenomena arising in, plankton dynamics, nerve impulses, chemotaxis, cardiac arrhythmias, epidemiology, and morphogenesis, to name a few (see J.D. Murray's classic text 'Mathematical Biology').  I interpret patterning in a broad sense to include both spatio-temporal dynamics and stationary solutions arising due to diffusion induced instability (Turing patterns). Researchers are becoming more aware of the need to incorporate spatial structure in biological and epidemiological models, and to identify spatial scales. Spatial structures correspond to physical features of the environment, or to intrinsic characteristics of ecological processes and phenomena. Most realistic models are nonlinear, and thus numerical methods have a vital role to play in investigating the key mechanisms that regulate self organization in complex systems. However, the numerical analysis of RDEs with real applications lags behind advances in modeling. Therefore, the development of efficient and accurate numerical methods for the approximation of spatially explicit biological models is a fertile and growing research field.  Another area that is underdeveloped is the control of pattern formation using the mathematical discipline of optimal control theory. In most situations, the need to control the evolution of a system comes naturally after establishing the mathematical model. Optimal control theory can also be used to identify key parameters in a biological system. The methodology I use in my proposal entails the cross-fertilization between numerical analysis, applied mathematical analysis, and scientific computing to study biological pattern formation modeled by RDEs. My proposal focuses on the numerical approximation and control of nonlinear RDEs modeling biological pattern formation, with applications in epidemiology, natural resource management, ecology, and various biomedical areas.

"Today, we need a wider variety of software solutions than ever before. It follows then that we need novel methods that will allow for rapid development of software systems in order to be ready for any future technological challenges. This situation motivated researchers to establish the model-driven engineering (MDE) discipline to achieve three goals: increasing the productivity of software developers by focusing on domain-specific (non-technical) details; reusing the same design for several platforms; and allowing for early discovery of software errors. However, software is a knowledge repository where knowledge is largely related to the application domain, and not to software as an entity itself. So, we need to be able to share (trace, manage, interoperate) the knowledge encoded in software with the knowledge about all relevant aspects surrounding and influencing software (e.g., requirements and policies). With today's critical role of the Web and Web-based software systems, the need to be able to share the knowledge based on which a system is build is even higher. This knowledge sharing and management requires the use of an explicit definition of knowledge, as that is a basic need for machines to be able to interpret knowledge. It is natural then why the Semantic Web technology is a promising way to address these current problems.

      This research explores the integration of the Semantic Web technology into software engineering by using MDE, with the final result producing synergetic effects for both technologies. These efforts can be in general classified into three general categories: (i) Integration of Semantic Web languages into the MDE theory; (ii) Model-driven engineering of Semantic Web languages; (iii) Semantic Web-enhanced development of domain-specific languages (for service-oriented architectures and e-learning). The major contribution is the semantic enhancement of the MDE process which should increase its efficiency and effectiveness, and assure that developed systems can precisely integrate the knowledge of domains under study. Moreover, the research should provide tools for developing software systems, leveraging benefits of the Semantic Web.","Information systems and technology","Computing and Information Sciences - A"

Phenomena associated with the decay of tritium offer a very powerful new tool in the study of amorphous semiconductors. In particular, Tritium decay within the a-Si:H network can be used to simulate and analyze the Staebler-Wronski (S-W) effect, which is responsible for the degradation of the opto-electronic properties of a-Si:H. Furthermore, the energy released during the decay can be harnessed and transformed into other, useful and harmless, forms of energy. The main objectives of this proposal are: to achieve a better understanding of the physical properties of amorphous semiconductors and of the effects of tritium in amorphous semiconductors. The research will be conducted at both theoretical and experimental levels. In addition, the energy ""crunch"" has brought the ""nuclear solution"" back to the forefront, and the Canadian nuclear plants, based on the CANDU reactor, represent a major and unique source of Tritium gas. This research will lead to the development and to the safe utilization of tritium in microelectronic devices, having the potential to benefit Canadian industry via exploration of practical applications of tritiated amorphous semiconductors, including self-powered light emitting devices and batteries. At least three M.Sc. students in the recently approved Master in Materials Science program will be involved in the research over the course of 5 years; several undergraduate students will also be involved in summer projects. The students will be provided training to: i) use Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) to simulate optoelectronic properties of semiconductors and other materials, ii) perform the experimental measurements required for the project.

"New technologies rely upon the creativity of researchers to develop designer materials with unique properties and function. For example, recent advances in polymer science have led to materials for LED displays, drug delivery and biodegradable food packaging. Many of the above polymer-based products were derived from fundamental curiosity driven research. The properties and applications for a polymer are a direct consequence of the arrangement and type of atoms that make up the chain structure. Most polymers in use today are composed of chains containing of carbon, oxygen, and/or nitrogen atoms. The development of polymers composed of other elements is at its infancy, however, there is considerable promise for these so-called inorganic polymers because of the unique properties imparted to the materials by heteroelements. 

    In this proposal, the development of new strategies to incorporate functional phosphorus groups into long chain polymers will be outlined. The living polymerization of P=C bonds, allows for precise control over chain lengths and microstructure and, consequently, polymer properties. In addition, these new polymers are highly chemically functional and their use as supports for metals will be explored. The development new pi-conjugated phosphorus polymers will also be outlined herein. This work is of fundamental importance since it further expands the known chemistry of the elements.  Moreover, these materials are attractive for application in metal-sequestering agents, green catalysis, sensors and nanoelectronics. Another topic of focus will be the synthesis and development of unusual three- and four-membered rings containing phosphorus. Small rings are relatively rare compared to the more widely known five-, six- and higher-membered rings. Due to their higher reactivity, small rings are useful building blocks for larger chemical structures.

    In closing, the work proposed herein further expands the fascinating chemistry of the element phosphorus. This work will lead to gains in fundamental knowledge of inorganic chemistry and polymer science, and will provide a foundation for future technological applications.

"Modern methods for the production of pharmaceuticals involve transition metals in at least one step of the production process. On one hand, the use of metals to catalyze the transformation of one drug precursor to another is attractive because catalysts tend to be highly efficient, selective towards the desired product and they reduce the generation of byproducts which contribute to the waste stream. On the other hand, the catalyst, often composed of a precious metal and a phosphorus-based supporting ligand, can be expensive and, due to toxicity concerns, must be removed from the pharmaceutical product according to strict regulations. Consequently, efficient methods are needed to maximize the efficiency of the synthesis of drug molecules while at the same time minimizing the presence of metal contaminants. This proposal addresses these problems by tackling two areas to improve processes used in modern pharmaceutical manufacture. This work will lead to greener pharmaceutical processes by improving efficiency, facilitating the recovery and recycling of precious metals. First, a set of novel phosphorus-containing polymers will be explored as potential metal scavenging agents. Phosphorus has a very high affinity for the types of metals used in the catalytic synthesis of many pharmaceuticals. Therefore, it is expected that these unique phosphorus polymers will be highly effective to ""trap"" metals within their scaffolds and effectively minimize metal-contamination of pharmaceuticals. The second area of proposed research involves using phosphorus-based polymers as supporting agents for the metal-catalyzed synthesis of pharmaceuticals. By binding the metal catalyst directly to the polymer, the efficient removal and recycling of the metal catalyst is facilitated. One can envision using immobilized forms of these polymers to support catalysis in a flow process for drug discovery and production. These projects each promise improved green processes to manufacture pharmaceuticals.","Manufacturing processes and products","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Manufacturing - B"

"Turbo codes and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are two categories of forward error control codes that operate very close to the Shannon capacity bound for communication channels. During the past decade, various aspects of code performance and decoder hardware implementation have been investigated.  Hardware implementation research has focused on either low power or high throughput implementations, whereas code design research has focused on the development of codes that operate at very low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).



For many reasons, the design of error control systems has traditionally separated the design of a code from the design of its associated decoder hardware.  This two-step process prevents code designers from accounting for decoder performance specifications, such as power consumption, in their design models and methodology.  However, some of my recent research results have demonstrated that density evolution, one of the techniques used in LDPC code design, can provide insight into the toggling statistics in a decoder, and hence into a decoder's dynamic power consumption.   Thus, when evaluating several codes for their SNR performance, one could additionally evaluate decoder power tradeoffs using similar information theoretic tools.



This proposal, at the intersection of coding theory and microelectronics, focuses on an extension of these recent research results.  The long-term objectives of the proposal are to develop design and analysis techniques for coded systems that account for decoder computational energy in the code design process.  This will require research into tools that are capable of analyzing decoder power consumption, possibly based on but not limited to density evolution techniques, and will require the verification of analytical results using physical measurements from fabricated integrated circuits or field-programmable gate array-based designs.

"Biological catalysts are essential for life. They enable the reactions that occur in living cells to occur at rates that can sustain life. For example, RNA is a molecule found in all living cells that translates the genetic code carried by DNA and translates it into proteins, the work molcules of cells. By itself in solution, it will take aaround 100 years to break. However, some biological catalysts can speed this reaction such that it occurs at the rate of several hundred times a minute!



In our research we are interested in two main types of enzymes - nitric oxide synthases and methionine sulfoxide reductases. The former ones catalyse the synthesis of the important messenger molecule NO, which is now known to play key roles in a range of physiological processes including blood pressure regulation and embryo development. The second class of enzymes are responsible for repairing oxidative dame to key residues in a range of enzymes. In fact, it has been shown that they can lengthen life-spans and increase the physical activity of fruit flies! However, for both of these enyzmes we do not yet know how they work.

"We are seeking to discover or refine new materials which display remarkable physical properties at low temperatures, and to then study these materials in order to understand why they behave the way they do.  The materials that we will study will be new magnetic, metallic, and superconducting materials, whose properties cannot be easily understood within a standard description of the physics of materials.  The knowledge we seek to create will be important in developing these classes of new materials for potential applications ranging from data storage and computation to electrical transport and devices which would improve our quality of life.



We will be intentionally building certain crystalline arrangements into the single crystals of the new materials which we will be studying, and we believe these arrangements will encourage exotic physical properties at low temperatures.  We will build up crystals comprised of networks of triangles and tetrahedra.  It is known that the most common form of magnetism in materials, antiferromagnetism, leads to exotic magnetic behaviour in materials made up of these types of building blocks.  We will build up crystals made up of loose assemblies of magnetic chains and planes.  These low dimensional structures also encourage exotic disordered magnetism at low temperatures.  Finally, we will be incorporating s=1/2 quantum magnetic moments into these and related crystalline structures which also encourage disorder through quantum fluctuations.



We will study the fascinating physical properties of the new materials using forefront neutron and x-ray scattering techniques.  These related techniques allow us a powerful microscopic perspective on the static and dynamic magnetism and structure of the materials.  An important dimension to this project is that we will be working to advance our capabilities and infrastructure for these types of scattering experiments on materials, particularly with new time-of-flight neutron instrumentation at the Spallation Neutron Source.

"Approximation algorithms are an elegant formal framework for dealing with intrinsically hard optimization problems. An approximation algorithm for an optimization problem produces a feasible solution in polynomial time that is within a constant multiplicative factor of  the optimal solution  for every instance of the problem. Approximation ratio is only a worst-case bound and  pathological instances are usually hard to find. It has been experimentally observed for a variety of approximation algorithms that, on average, the performance is vastly superior than the stated bound. An approximation algorithm can always be refined and tuned to specific classes of instances arising in practice, thereby improving  the performance. 



I am studying approximation algorithm design based on linear and semi-definite programming techniques. Quality or the integrality gap of the relaxation, techniques used to round the fractional solutions  to the integer solutions, and the time needed to compute the optimal solution to the relaxations, all effect the quality of the approximation. My research focusses  on improvements on  these fronts and it will lead to improved techniques and approximation algorithms for optimization problems.

"Every living thing on the planet is made up of small units called ""cells"". Each cell has the ability to reproduce itself, or to morph onto a specialized cell type. Cells also have the ability to commit suicide, a phenomenon termed apoptosis. During apoptosis, cells dismantle themselves into tiny bits and pieces. These fragments are then eaten by neighboring cells. This process is very important, as it allows the controlled elimination of cells. For instance, the targeted apoptosis of cells leads to the formation of hollow structures such as the intestines.



Glutamine is an amino acid which is very abundant in the blood. Work done during the past 50 years has demonstrated that glutamine promotes cell survival by blocking apoptosis. A number of situations arise where glutamine levels in the body are insufficient, and this is enough to cause some cell types to apoptose. Sick people in intensive care units and high level athletes often have frequent infections, in part because the low glutamine in their blood is not sufficient for the survival of cells of the immune system. Glutamine is also important for the survival of several cell types used in the biotechnology industry for the production of reagents such as antibodies. When grown in large vats, these cells use up most of the glutamine available to them, and they die. This obviously reduces the productivity of these cells and increases cost to biotechnology industries.



The applicant is interested in understanding how a such a simple molecule like glutamine can control cell survival. The work proposed here aims at gaining detailed knowledge of how the lack of glutamine alters the molecules responsible for maintaining cells alive. This work will not only increase our knowledge of how nutrients such as glutamine promote cell survival, but will also provide new ways to improve the behavior of cell types of biotechnological interest.

"Butyl rubber (isobutylene-isoprene rubber, IIR) is a material with unusual physical properties, useful in different areas including automotive, architectural, and biomedical applications. A good resilience (shape recovery upon deformation) is necessary for all these applications. This is possible for IIR because the polymer chains contain a low concentration (1-2%) of isoprene (unsaturated) units in addition to isobutylene, allowing covalent (permanent) cross-linking of the chains into a 3-dimensional network structure. The covalent bonding approach, while providing good dimensional stability, allows only limited control over the mechanical properties of the material. Ionic interactions, on the other hand, are known to be very useful to modify the mechanical properties (e.g. rigidity, softening temperature, tear resistance) of rubbers and plastics, and have found applications in commercial products such as the Surlyn� resins, used as highly tear-resistant materials for blister packaging. The improved properties of polymers containing a low concentration of polymer-bound ionic groups (ionomers) are attributed to the aggregation of the ionic moieties, acting as multivalent physical cross-links at low to moderate temperatures. The application of the ionomer concept to improve the mechanical properties of butyl rubber has received little attention, mainly due to the very low (1-2%) isoprene content achieved in the traditional butyl rubber synthesis. New processes developed recently at LANXESS Inc. allow the synthesis of butyl rubber containing 1) up to 5-6% of isoprene units, or 2) up to 10% of p-methylstyrene units. This would allow the synthesis of ionomers with higher ionic moieties contents, and correspondingly a much wider range of mechanical properties than for traditional IIR. In the proposed project, reaction conditions will be established for the derivatization of high isoprene content IIR and of p-methylstyrene-modified IIR to novel ionomers by different techniques, and the mechanical properties of the resulting polymers will be investigated to correlate their structure with the observed properties. These butyl rubber ionomers are emerging materials of interest for applications in areas including the automotive industry.

"Our research efforts focus on the synthesis and the physical characterization of graft polymers with a dendritic architecture, the arborescent polymers (AP). These macromolecules have a uniform size ranging from 2-100 nm, very high molecular weights (1E4-1E8) and branching functionalities (f=10-10000+), and a controllable chemical composition. The extensive control achieved over the structure of these materials is highly beneficial, from a fundamental viewpoint, for the establishment of structure-property correlations in branched polymers, and for their utilization in nanotechnology-related applications. Five distinct activity areas have been identified in the current proposal: 1) The solution properties of AP with polyelectrolyte side chains will be examined, focusing particularly on the formation of gels in intermediate- to low-polarity solvents, as these materials may be useful as pH-sensitive smart gels. 2) Amphiphilic AP will be studied with respect to their ability to self-assemble, either at the air-water interface or in solution, to yield superstructures (e.g. rod-like and large compound micelle assemblies) and to pattern surfaces on the manometer scale. These copolymers will also be investigated for the solubilization and release of hydrophobic compounds in aqueous environments, to serve as model systems for the controlled delivery of hydrophobic drugs. 3) New AP with enhanced biocompatibility, potentially useful as practical drug delivery devices, will be synthesized from amino acids and investigated for their solubilization properties. 4) The rheological properties of AP incorporating elastomeric chain segments will be examined to improve the understanding of the influence of branching on polymer processability. 5) A new grafting technique using ""click"" chemistry will be developed to allow the high yield synthesis of AP with long side chains, which have been elusive so far. The fundamental knowledge gained from the proposed work will help clarify the influence of branching on different physical properties, over a much wider range of branching functionalities than has been achieved so far using other model systems such as the star-branched polymers.","Polymers, rubber and plastics","Anal. & Phys.

In particular, we shall investigate the universality propeties and value distribution of the Riemann zeta function   

and specifically the distribution of zero values, in the hope of contributing towards a solution to the Riemann hypothesis. Our approach is via approximation theory, not number theory.

"Data assimilation is concerned with using information from all available observations obtained from a variety of instruments to estimate the current state of the atmosphere to improve the quality of weather forecasts. Based on statistical estimation principles, an a priori estimate of the atmosphere is provided by a short term forecast obtained from a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Its accuracy is represented by the background-error covariances, which depend on the meteorological situation. In cases associated with the onset of atmospheric instability, the initial conditions need to embed the dynamical structure that can trigger the development of a weather system. This proposal is concerned in making advances in data assimilation by introducing flow-dependent structures within the assimilation process that are in a position to improve the quality of forecasts of high impact weather events in the short, medium and long range. This will also be applied to adaptive data selection to improve the use of the vast amount of satellite data received daily at operational weather centres.

Different approaches have been proposed to deal with the presence of model error and will be investigated. This research proposes first to use simple controlled experiments to generate synthetic observations, estimate the 'true' model error and examine the quality of the resulting analyses and forecasts. In a second phase, it is proposed to use archives of products from operational ensemble prediction systems (EPS) to estimate and represent model error from multi-model EPS products The objective would be to study suboptimal forms that could be implemented in operational systems to improve the quality of weather analyses and forecasts.

"Research activities in translationally symmetric photonic crystals have continuously increased since its conception in the late 1980s.  Significant advances in theoretical analysis and applications have been made with numerous device designs proven in the laboratory environment.  In the 1990s, the high rotationally symmetric photonic quasi-crystal made its debut and was shown to display the important properties of the translation symmetric counterparts.  However they have received less attention as the theoretical tools required to thoroughly analyze the structures are still lacking and structure fabrication is more difficult.  This research project is focused on advancing the photonic quasi-crystal know how through advancements in theoretical analysis, structure fabrication and device development.  Theoretical advancements will follow along the lines of exploring the rotational symmetry properties of photonic quasi-crystals with the objective of linking a polar spectral decomposition with a polar band structure.  Existing in-house developed simulation tools will be enhanced based on the theoretical advancements and chosen device configurations.  In the fabrication of structures, the plan is to explore the production and characterization of photonic quasi-crystals in SOI, LiNbO3 and glass.  These three substrates are selected for the following reasons, SOI provides a high dielectric contrast for photonic quasi-crystal structures and displays a high potential for next generation devices. LiNbO3 is a mature substrate technology showing several interesting optical properties such as birefringence and is electro-optic.  LiNbO3 also retains a high dielectric contrast for photonic quasi-crystal structures. Glass provides a dielectric value compatible with the optical fiber technology and as such fiber-waveguide coupling is simpler.  The high dielectric contrast is achieved by loading the glass waveguide with a thin high dielectric cladding.  Structures fabricated will be characterized in the existing optical measurement laboratory and designs showing promising results will be configured into optical devices. A large portion of the SOI research will be conducted in collaboration with a researcher at the University of Arizona's Optical Sciences center.","Materials sciences","Electrical and Computer Engineering"

"This project aims to understand the variability of the creep behavior of the pressure tubes in CANDU reactors and its relations to microstructural differences found within these pressure tubes. This variability results in an uncertainty in the lifetime prediction for these materials (typically Zr-Nb alloys), a major problem for this industry. We propose a combined experimental approach including extensive characterization of the microstructure and bulk creep testing on representative microstructures. This will provide direct correlation between creep behavior and the microstructure of a pressure tube. Advanced microscopy techniques will identify and characterize representative microstructures and dislocation sub-structures found in CANDU reactor tubes with micro structural parameters obtained with statistical methods. These advanced electron microscopy techniques are electron backscattering diffraction patterns (EBSD) obtained in a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), three dimensional microstructure with combined focus ion beam (FIB) and FE-SEM microscopes using EBSD and x-ray microanalysis and start of the art field emission scanning transmission electron microscopy (FE-STEM) with a Cs aberration corrector having sub - Angstrom resolution equipped with an EDS x-ray detector. Nanoindentation will also be used to evaluate the mechanical properties of these microstructures and also of their individual phases.  The parameters describing the microstructure of these alloys will be used to create model, based on Levitin's theory [1], to predict the lifetime of Zr-Nb alloys for CANDU pressure tubes. An accurate prediction of the lifetime of pressure tubes for CANDU reactors will allow for more efficient use of nuclear energy at a time when green house gas are an issue and a reduced dependence on conventional fuels, such as oil and coal, is needed. Since Gentilly II will be refurnished in 2011, this project needs to generate predictive data by the end of 2010.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"
"Characterization of the microstructure of materials with a spatial resolution of the order of 1 nm is normally performed using field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM). This characterization includes quantitative chemical analysis using x-ray microanalysis, the determination of the crystalline structure with electron diffraction and the nature of the atomic bonds using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). FE-TEM requires specimens that must be transparent to the electron beam. Preparing thin foils for FE-TEM observation can be a long and tedious process. However, since it was reported that Fast Secondary Electrons (FSE) can degrade the resolution of X-Ray microanalysis in FE-TEM for the quantification of light elements, the ultimate resolution of this technique is still an issue. Auger electrons were reported recently to have potentially the same effect. Since the mid 1990's, the Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) are available on the market. Low voltage FE-SEM has an image resolution of 2 nm. Since specimen preparation is easier in FE-SEM than in FE-TEM, this explains the increasing popularity of low voltage FE-SEM. Also, transparent thin films for FE-TEM observations have an observable area of 0.25   where polished specimens inserted in the FE-SEM have area of the order of 1cm2. Therefore the area observable in the FE-SEM is 400,000,000 greater than in the TEM, leading to vastly superior statistical information about the microstructure of a given material. However, FE-TEM can determine the microstructure of nanomaterials in three dimension using electron tomography and software development is needed to improve its spatial resolution. This project will develop the scientific software that will allow FE-SEM to perform chemical quantitative x-ray analysis of heterogeneous materials, to determine their crystalline structure by simulating electron backscattered diffraction patterns and to develop a new x-ray detector for soft x-ray spectroscopy. The effect of FSE and Auger electrons on x-ray microanalysis and a new tomography method will also be developed for the FE-TEM.

"The purpose of the proposed research is to develop a method for designing concrete bridge deck slabs that accounts for the beneficial effects of arching action, and that is valid for any given geometry and all types of ferrous reinforcement (reinforcing steel, prestressing steel, and steel fibres). It is anticipated that this research will produce a major step forward relative to the empirical method of deck slab design which is included in current Canadian and US bridge design standards. This method enables designers to account for arching action in the design of deck slabs within a relatively limited range of parameters. Within this range, it leads to reduced quantities of reinforcing steel in deck slabs relative to the reinforcement that would be required considering only bending behaviour. By shifting the basis by which arching action can be considered in design from an empirical to a rational one, the proposed research will significantly extend the range of situations in which the benefits of arching action can be exploited.   

     This research project has the potential to bring about a major increase in the economy of bridges in two primary ways. First, it will enable the design of more economical deck slabs in situations that lie outside the limits specified by the current empirical method. For example, it will allow slabs spanning more than 4.0 m to be made thinner and to be more lightly reinforced than current designs in this range. Second, it will enable the design of more economical bridge superstructures. It is widely recognized, for example, that wider girder spacings increase the economy of bridge superstructures. Until now, designers have been discouraged from using girder spacings greater than the current 4.0 metre limit prescribed by the empirical method because this would result in an uneconomical deck slab designed on the basis of bending. A rational means to account for arching action in slabs outside this range will help to eliminate the economic penalty associated with the deck slab when wider girder spacings are used.

"In information technology, biometric refers to a study of physical and behavioral characteristics with the purpose of personal authentication. In recent years, the area of biometrics has witnessed tremendous growth, partly as a result of a pressing need for heightened security, and partly as a response to the new technological advances that are literally changing the way we live. In academia, government, industry and everyday life, biometric systems are being utilized to ensure secure building access, for passport control, to secure bank transactions, for authenticity of credit card users, admitted as evidence in courts and serve as protection against crime. 



The goal of this research is to develop a new group of methods based on the innovative paradigm of an Adaptive Hierarchical data representation. The model would allow the storage of biometric data in a compact form, have highly efficient access to it when needed, have the ability to retrieve and visualize the data preserving even the slightest details, have a set of interactive tools for biometric data analysis that  would 

utilize topological properties of the data, and allow the visualization of dynamic changes to the model in a smooth and continuous manner.  Particular emphasis would be given to the application of the model for 3D face reconstruction, fingerprint surface modeling and iris synthesis.  



The outcomes of the research will impact not only the way in which biometric information is represented, processed and visualized, but also the state of the art of related disciplines, such as image processing, pattern matching, surface reconstruction, terrain modeling, and information systems research.

"My proposed research deals with software for small and inexpensive devices which can communicate wirelessly (via radio channels) and organize themselves into so-called wireless sensor networks. Such networks are intended to be large and inconspicuous at the same time (e.g., consisting of a large number of small and cheap nodes), durable (e.g., capable of operating for several years without replacing the batteries), robust (resilient to failures of its individual members), and maintenance-free (self-organizing and requiring no human attendance).  Application areas for such networks include ecological monitoring (temperature, humidity, soil condition), tracking movable objects (industrial assets, goods requiring special attention, animals including cattle, as well as people), detecting anomalies in the environment (diagnosing hazards, triggering alerts), assisting disaster response, and many others. In my work, I will study ways to program wireless sensor networks as to accomplish these goals: 1) maintaining small program size without sacrificing its structurability, readability, and reusability; 2) devising robust collaboration patterns (distributed programs), i.e., ones that do not break down in the face of inherently poor reliability of the individual nodes; 3) making it possible to authoritatively test the network programs in a simulated environment before deploying them into the real network; 4) modularizing network programs with the intention of recycling their components in other wireless sensing applications.  One of my objectives is to build real sensor networks which other researchers can use as tools in their work (e.g., the EcoNet project at the University of Alberta).

"Leishmania parasites are causative agents of leishmaniasis in humans. Leishmania donovani complex cause visceral leishmaniasis and account for over 500,000 new cases and 59,000 deaths every year. Although several potential vaccine candidates have been identified, there are no vaccines for leishmaniasis. In addition, emergence of drug resistance is another major problem in leishmaniasis control. Leishmania modulates immune response and the parasite factors involved and detailed mechanism of modulation of host immune system and signaling pathways are not fully understood. Cysteine proteases are potential drug and vaccine candidates implicated in modulation of host immune system and signaling pathways. Interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-�) are the major pro-inflammatory cytokines produced during Leishmania pathogenesis to escape microbicidal activities of the host. Although parasite cysteine proteases have been implicated in the process, the specific host molecules targeted and the detailed mechanisms are not yet determined. However, activation of TGF-�1 due to cleavage of pre-TGF-�1 in vitro by L. chagasi cathepsin B cysteine proteases has been reported from our lab although its significance in survival and pathogenesis is not yet determined. Thus, we propose to identify and characterize host molecules (pathways) targeted by L. donovani cathepsin B and cathepsin L cysteine proteases during host-parasite interaction. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1.) Study the concerted role of L. donovani cathepsin B and cathepsin L  cysteine proteases in TGF-� and IL-10 dependant pathways and 2.) Identify and characterize host molecules targeted by L. donovani cathepsin B and cathepsin L cysteine proteases. Discovering host molecules (pathways) involved in defense against leishmaniasis could revolutionize the way drugs and vaccines are developed against leishmaniasis and other infectious agents.

"During infection, the immune system provides defenses against destructive properties of viruses, bacteria, and other parasites. Different types of immune system cells have different roles in the induction and maintenance of an immune response. One group of cells that is important is called monocytic cells. These cells have the ability to migrate throughout the body and give signals to other cells, in effect acting as traffic wardens to direct other cells towards sites of infection or injury. One of the ways in which the monocytes perform this is by secreting proteins termed cytokines. A particularly important cytokine, interleukin (IL)-12 plays an important role in the immune response against bacterial or viral infections. This leads to activation of an immune response resulting in clearance of the bacteria or virus and thus recovery from infection. However, in some cases, the regulation of expression of IL-12 by the monocytes becomes disrupted by infection. This may result in deleterious effects to the infected individual. The role of IL-12 has been well-documented. However a related cytokine, IL-23 has been newly discovered and its role in the generation of an immune response has not been well documented. It is known that this cytokine shares similar features with IL-12 but also has significantly different functions. Understanding of how cytokines are regulated is critical to vaccine design and treatment for infections. Monocytic cells will be isolated from healthy volunteers and the ability of these cells to produce IL-23 will be studied. The project is designed to define how IL-23 expression is regulated on a molecular level. The techniques involved will result in the training of highly qualified personnel. It is expected that one graduate student and one technician will be hired to complete this project. Human monocytics will be examined for their ability to produce IL-23. This will be measured by examining the activation of proteins inside the cell, kinases, which act as messengers to inform the cell how much cytokine to produce. Disruption of the normal course of events may distort the signals given to the cell and result in the blockade of the immune response. By understanding how monocytes regulate IL-23 expression, new ways of treating diseases may be discovered.

"My research focuses on the problem of constructing a quantum theory which describes the interaction of fields and particles with the gravitational field.  This remains THE unsolved problem in fundamental theoretical physics.  My particular research program in this area involves constructing toy quantum gravity models; that is, theories which address the basic issue but are less encumbered by the profound technical difficulties associated with this problem.  Typically, these toy models involve physics in which`space' has less than three dimensions.  One such class of theories, quantum dilaton gravity, has only one spatial dimension.  These models can be pushed quite far, and in them one can address some of the difficult issues in quantum gravity- for instance, the problem of time, the occurrence of singularities and the decay of black holes.  My current work in this area proceeds from a novel procedure for constructing quantum theories, and predicts a discrete, lattice-like structure for space.  Another problem that I work on concerns non-linear sigma models.  String theories are a type of non-linear sigma model in which the background spacetime geometry is flat, as in the special theory of relativity.  If the background is not flat, then the self-consistency of the theory requires that certain equations, called the RG flow, have fixed points and these fixed points are the permissible backgrounds.  I am looking at RG flows and addressing questions concerning the relationship between these equations and the dynamical changes (that is, changes in time) of geometries and other fields.  Finally, I am looking at theories which generalize conformal field theories.  The latter are field theories over a two dimensional spacetime, characterized by an infinite dimensional symmetry algebra, called the Kac-Moody algebra.  I am looking at generalizations which are field theories in a four dimensional spacetime, and are characterized by a certain generalizations of the Kac-Moody algebras, called 2-Toroidal Lie algebras.

"Forecasting the future is one of the most important activities in our life. Every day, inventory, production, scheduling of personnel and machinery, financial and marketing decisions are made which depend on short, medium and long-term forecasts.  A good forecaster must be able to quickly identify a bridge between the available data and the most relevant modeling technique, provide the reliable inference about the future and to adapt the forecasting model to new changes in the world. In many practical situations the sample size of observations is not known a-priori and may indefinitely increase while a data analyst still needs to perform prediction tasks in real time. Such cases are typically referred to as online modelling and forecasting and are widely met in a variety of modern applications, e.g. prediction of stock or currency exchange returns, filtering electrocardiogram measurements of heart rate etc. Arrival of new observations often implies that the order of the currently utilized model should be refined and, thus, all model parameters need to be recalculated. Hence, computational costs eventually increase. This is especially important if the underlying model has a complicated structure.

      The goal of the proposed research is to investigate theoretical and practical properties of approximating more complicated model structures by simpler autoregressive models, which parameters are estimated using the Regularized Least Squares method. Among the potential benefits of the proposed methodology are computational efficiency, parsimonius model structure, wide applicability to a variety of time series that are of particular practical importance nowadays, e.g. long memory processes. The proposed methodology has common threads with shrinkage and ridge regressions and involves such statistical areas as analysis of long range dependent and periodic time series, optimal model selection and elements of information theory, Bayesian inference and generally theory of estimation and inference for stochastic processes. Potential applications include financial time series analysis, signal and image processing, weather and climate modelling.

"Microbes are involved in an overwhelming variety of biogeochemical processes. In the perennially hypoxic St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE), they control organic matter (OM) degradation through respiration processes and thus oxygen levels in the different compartments of the ecosystem. They could also play a major role in the long-term preservation of OM in sediments. However, because of the complexity of the processes at play, identifying the microbial contributions to the cycling of OM and the compartments in which they are most active is not an easy task. Questions regarding the understanding of the biogeochemical processes controlling the long-term health of the SLE converge on a better understanding of the role of microbes in the redox conditions characterizing this system and in OM preservation in the sediments. 



The ship time requested in this application will allow a team of researchers sharing common scientific interests and a highly complementary expertise to (i) constrain microbial processes controlling OM cycling and dissolved O2 concentrations in the waters and sediments of the SLE, and (ii) quantify the bacterial bio- and necromass and assessing their contributions to long-term OM preservation in the sediments. An array of complementary biogeochemical assays and techniques will be used to map the abundance and diversity of microbial communities, as well as bacterial production/respiration and nitrification/denitrification rates, in the water column, the bottom nepheloid layer and the sediment. These methods, belonging to the specialized fields of microbiology, molecular biology, inorganic and organic geochemistry, will be applied to dissolved and particulate material.  Water samples and sediment cores (box and long piston) will be collected in the Upper and Lower SLE between Quebec and Ste-Anne-des-Monts, as well as in the Saguenay Fjord.

"The stable isotope composition of dissolved organic carbon (d13C-DOC) provides powerful information towards understanding carbon sources and cycling, but analytical limitations have precluded its routine measurement in natural estuarine and seawater samples. The methods employed to measure d13C-DOC in marine samples tend to be long and tedious usually requiring highly specialized, expensive equipment, large sample volumes, and a number of steps to remove carbonates and quantitatively convert DOC into CO2 for eventual off-line analysis by mass spectrometry. Recent interfacing of wet oxidation-based dissolved organic carbon analyzers and isotope ratio mass spectrometers has simplified the measurement of d13C-DOC in freshwaters, but the analysis of salty estuarine/marine samples still proves difficult. We have successfully coupled the a high-temperature catalytic oxidation-based total organic carbon analyzer to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (HTC-IRMS) through cryogenic trapping of analyte gases exiting the HTC analyzer for routine analysis of d13C-DOC in estuarine and marine samples (Panetta R.J., Ibrahim M., G�linas, Y. (2008) Anal. Chem. 80, 5232-5239). We are one of the very few laboratories in the world currently capable of routinely measuring samples over the natural range of DOC concentrations (from 35 �M to over 2000 �M), and salinities (<0.1 to 36 g/kg) encountered in the environment, with excellent d13C-DOC accuracy (� 0.2 per mil) and precision (� 0.3 per mil). 



We are requesting support to replace the total organic carbon analyzer that is interfaced with our mass spectrometer and that has reached the end of its useful life (eight years of intensive use running salty samples). Several research projects and collaborations at the national and international levels are anchored to this unique analytical capability and will have to be dropped without a new instrument.

"The statistical and economical importance of this research proposal is to advance the statistical toolset used to identify the factors which drive large price changes in financial markets; to measure these price changes more precisely; and to quantify the impact of these changes on return distribution more precisely.  Since the valuation of derivative securities, inferring extreme risks, and the statistical measures of optimal portfolio allocation all require reliable measures of jumps and henceforth volatility, the impact of this research program will further the scientific progress on jump detection and will be very beneficial to the management of financial risks in an economy.



Tremendous research efforts have been dedicated to jump detection in asset prices in the last two decades.  In comparison to continuous price changes, jumps have distinctly different modeling, inference and testing specifications.  Although there are several tests on jump detection that provide successful identification of jumps, these existing tests cannot provide the exact location of jumps.



In this research proposal, a method based on maximum overlap wavelet transformation will be designed in order to detect and estimate the exact jump location, jump size, and number of jumps from high frequency data. The large price drops, or large negative returns, correspond to large volatility and jumps, which are often difficult to disentangle.  Since high volatility and jumps often occur together, separating jumps would lead to more precise volatility measures, jump size and jump distribution estimations. These findings will provide an enhanced toolset for financial regulators (e.g. central banks); commercial and investment banks (financial risk management); and financial wealth managers (fund allocation decisions with pension funds).

"Spectrometry using the beat note of two laser frequency combs is poised to revolutionize the field of infrared

spectroscopy, promising to deliver high sensitivity, high resolution and tremendous measurement speed. Such

improvements in the quality of infrared teledetection measurements will definitely have critical impacts on

security applications, such as the detection of chemical, biological agents and pollutants. This is important to

prevent and mitigate potential events by monitoring the air quality in an area deemed critical as well as in the

response to an event in helping to quickly detect, identify and quantify if a given disseminated powder, liquid,

gel or aerosol is harmful or not.

To bring the frequency comb heterodyne technique out of the very few labs currently demonstrating it, serious

engineering research has to be carried, notably on the stabilisation of portable femtosecond laser sources. The

end goal of this proposal is therefore to develop a field portable frequency comb heterodyne mid-infrared

"One billion people worldwide are affected by neurological disorders. The economic cost of neurological disorders comprises 28 percent of the economic cost of all diseases in Canada. In many patients with neurological disorders, drug therapy has failed or proved to be inefficient. Lack of reliable diagnosis and lack of effective therapies are among deficiencies in treating neurological disorders. Electrical cortical stimulation and recording have been proven useful in diagnostics and treatment of a number of neurological disorders. Existing technologies do not satisfy many of the requirements for medical implants, such as the small size, good localization of recording and stimulation sites, high accuracy of recordings, and wireless functionality. The proposed signal acquisition and processing technology performs real-time monitoring and modulation of the brain electrical activity in a small-size, low-cost, and wirelessly-powered implantable electro-mechanical module. It combines MEMS fabrication technology and CMOS-based signal acquisition, processing and generation techniques to yield over 1000 recording and stimulation electrodes. This technology promises to open new commercialization, business-growth and policy-related opportunities to the supporting organizations, Medtrode Inc and NRC, and to bring treatment for those patients with neurophysiological disorders who have no current treatment options available to them. The enthusiastic support this project has received from the world-class neurosurgeons at the University of Toronto speaks to the potential of this technology to provide irreplaceable medical diagnostics and therapy procedures for neural disorders diagnosis and treatment, and to make the world a healthier place.","Electrical and electronic machinery and equipment (including computer hardware)","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Biomedical Technologies"

Integration of sensors with embedded intelligence and convenient user interface will further significantly expand this market. This proposal outlines the research program carried out at the Intelligent Sensory Microsystems Laboratory at the University of Toronto. We will continue to conduct innovative research on integrated devices, circuits, architectures and algorithms for smart sensory microsystems design. Two specific research projects within the scope of Intelligent Sensory Microsystems are described in this application: 1) Brain interface microsystem for treatment of neurological disorders, and 2) Tip-of-the-catheter microsystem for real-time multi-analyte intravenous imaging. The projects offer opportunities to develop much needed cutting edge smart sensors technologies in Canada. The society will benefit not only economically.

"Molybdenum is the only second-row transition element with a known function in animals. It fulfills functional roles in enzymes in almost all living creatures, from bacteria through plants to invertebrates and mammals. The molybdenum enzymes all contain the metal bound by an unusual sulfur-containing cofactor. Despite possessing common structural elements, the enzymes are remarkable in the range of different chemical reactions that are catalyzed, although almost all are two-electron oxidation-reduction reactions in which an oxygen atom is transferred to or from the molybdenum. The functional roles filled by molybdenum enzymes are equally diverse; for example, they play essential roles in microbial respiration, in the uptake of nitrogen in green plants, in controlling insect eye color, and in human health. The proposed work is a systematic study of all the major families of molybdenum enzymes using the synchrotron-based technique of X-ray absorption spectroscopy. We propose to use a novel holistic approach in combining information from X-ray absorption spectroscopy, advanced computer molecular modeling, and available protein crystal structures to obtain the most accurate picture yet of the active sites. The ultimate goal of the work is to develop an in-depth quantitative structural and electronic understanding of the catalytic mechanisms used by the enzymes, comparing and contrasting between and within the different families. This will lead to an improved understanding of how molybdenum enzymes achieve their remarkable functional diversity. The benefits of this research are three-fold. i) The results will yield detailed insights for an important group of enzymes. ii) The holistic approach developed will be broadly applicable to all metalloprotein studies. iii) The research will strengthen the Canadian effort in utilizing one of the major synchrotron tools in structural molecular biology - X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

"One of the amazing features of pure mathematics research is how shockingly often it discovers beautiful general results which can be used to help answer important problems in other parts of science and engineering.



This is the case with the problems being considered in this proposal. The research is in the area called ""algebraic geometry"", a subject that has been around since the ancient Greeks studied the sections of a cone. The problem we consider in this proposal is: how big is the set of solutions to a collection of equations? Knowing how to answer that question for the particular equations that come up in this proposal will help decide: if an evolutionary tree proposed by biologists is correct; if it is possible to use an enormously powerful computer to multiply exceedingly large matrices in an efficient manner (something, for example, that economists are interested in doing when they seek to model our economy); how medical researchers can extract useful data from millions of patient records where each individual record contains either none or only a very little bit of data on one specific disease.



One of the goals of the proposal is to train young researchers to become expert in algebraic geometry and to also understand the nature of the problems in biology, statistics and computing which are amenable to solution by the methods of this proposal. This is a new field of research in Canada which has the potential to offer opportunities to forge new connections between pure mathematics, biology, computing and statistics. My students will also have the opportunity to participate in the proposed European-based Research Network on Applications of Algebraic Geometry and other initiatives being planned (e.g. at the Mittag-Leffler Institute in 2010) which are connected to the research in this proposal.

"The specific goal of this research project is to use VIDO's expertise in vaccine formulation and delivery to

develop a new vaccine platform for avian influenza in turkeys. The long-term goal of this partnership is to

develop platform technologies based on co-formulation of novel vaccines and adjuvants. Current autogenous

vaccines against avian influenza require up to four immunizations and are purchased in the United States for

import into Canada. We propose to develop vaccine formulations that are more effective, require less

immunizations and inexpensive to produce. Our industry partner Maple Leaf has expressed great interest in

such novel technologies to enhance availability, increase productivity, reduce immunization costs (through

enhanced efficacy and reduced doses), while at the same time increasing safety and consumer protection. The

current proposal focuses on the initial development, formulation and safety assessment of influenza vaccine

formulations in turkeys. If successful, we anticipate that this project will establish the ground work for a

longer-term relationship between VIDO and Maple Leaf for the development of further livestock and poultry

vaccines. Such vaccines will be of great benefit to Maple Leaf, but also to the entire Canadian agricultural

"Riverine ecosystems are highly dynamic and heterogeneous ecosystems, due to both natural and anthropogenic forces. The heterogeneity of coastal riparian forests makes them among the most biodiverse of temperate forests, but also challenging to map over broad areas. A variety of ecologically important structures within coastal floodplain forests result in spatial patterns at different scales. Many of these patterns include textural, spatial and spectral properties which aid in their discrimination using high spatial resolution satellite imagery. The potential of fine-scale imagery (with sub-metre resolution) for use in riparian mapping is particularly compelling, as such areas have been challenging to discern using coarser imagery. The goal of this proposed research program is to rigorously quantify hierarchical patterns of natural and anthropogenic variability in river-floodplains using a suite of new remote sensing tools and ground-truth information. We emphasize the use, extension, and testing of techniques developed in our pilot site to new larger floodplains within Clayoquot Sound, with an emphasis on rare habitats of conservation concern and patterns of natural and anthropogenic disturbance. We will classify high spatial resolution imagery along three rivers in coastal British Columbia using state-of-the-art object-based classification software, as well as assess broad-scale variability using coarser-scale imagery and landscape pattern indices. Using this combination of tools to understand the variability within river-floodplains, at both fine and broad spatial scales, will help disentangle the anthropogenic and natural agents of change in river-floodplain ecosystems. As part of our long-term objectives, we also examine additional sites in Haida Gwaii and along the Skeena River, which include pristine areas as well as those modified by historic forest management. These same river systems will also be examined within an historical framework, by quantifying past variability using historic reconstruction and aerial photos. These different approaches will add a critical dimension to our understanding of some of the most biodiverse and heavily managed river-floodplain systems in BC.

"The human voice is an expressive and eloquent musical instrument.  Song and other human-instrument music is ubiquitous in many cultures and is one of the primary forms of modern entertainment.  With the rise of internet music sharing and sales, interacting with music is becoming a large research topic, but current techniques often concentrate on timbre, rhythm, and other characteristics that music listeners would consider the ""background"" of the music. Much of the ""content"" of current popular music is contained in the singer's lyrics, expression and style. When pitch is addressed, it is usually instrumental pitch, and when lyrics are considered, they are usually available as text.



One of the primary goals of the music information retrieval community is to develop systems whereby a user can hum a tune and the system will identify that tune from a database of possible music.  This difficult task is compounded when users want to add more information by singing lyrics.  One of the aims of this work will be to develop feature models, signal processing techniques, and classification systems that allow for the transcription of human singing.



People don't only listen to music, they create it as well. Many people claim that they cannot carry a tune, and yet are capable of humming or whistling along with the radio. This research has the potential to provide amateurs, untrained singers and even non-singers with the tools to interact with music in new and less threatening ways, and gain confidence with music. Professional singers will be provided with tools that make use of their training to facilitate writing of music, to hone their skill, and to interact with music in challenging and intriguing ways.  In the long term, deep and accurate models of human song may lead to a computer that sings to us.

"Without industry, Canadians would not enjoy the prosperity they do. But the cost of this progress has been high: as many as 30,000 chemically contaminated sites around the country, each one a potential threat to human and environmental health. Whether because of poor disposal methods or accidental leaks, the soil at these former industrial sites now contains a toxic soup of chemicals, which can enter the air and the groundwater and put humans at risk. Cleaning up these 'brownfield' sites is not only a Canadian health priority, but a key step towards sustainability: many of these abandoned sites are prime real estate and restoring them provides substantial economic and social benefits to urban areas. However, for the most challenging contaminants, virtually no cheap and effective clean-up techniques are available.

In this research, an entirely new remediation technology is being developed that promises to treat some of the most hazardous brownfield sites more thoroughly, quickly, and cost effectively than current techniques. The experiments being conducted at U. Western Ontario will demonstrate - with images, careful experiments, and computer simulations - that this technique offers unique advantages over existing clean up methods. Most notable is that minimal energy is required for clean-up - meaning that site remediation is expected to be both relatively inexpensive and highly sustainable. This innovative research is the joint development of Canadian and International researchers partnering with a Canadian-based clean-up company that will help guide the experiments towards field applications and commercialization. This research represents a new opportunity to reduce health risks and reap economic benefits by site clean-up in Canada. Moreover, it puts Canada at the forefront of a new technology that has the potential to be applicable to sites throughout the industrialized world.

But the cost of this progress has been high: as many as 30,000 chemically contaminated sites around the country, each one a potential threat to human and environmental health.Whether because of poor disposal methods or accidental leaks, the soil at these former industrial sites now contains a toxic soup of chemicals. This includes familiar liquids like gasoline and oil, industrial by-products like solvents and coal tars, and even a few substances now banned in Canada, including PCBs. When groundwater flows through these sites it becomes unusable-and potentially dangerous.  But cleanup is not cheap. Using current techniques, it would cost tens of billions of dollars to clean up all contaminated sites in Canada. 



In this research, Dr. Jason Gerhard is developing a wider array of practical and cost-effective technologies and strategies for eliminating hazardous chemicals in the soil.  Instead of guessing at what works right, Dr. Gerhard recreates the environment of a toxic site in his lab, and then runs a number of tests to see which strategies work best. This helps him understand the complex ways different chemicals, soils, and rocks interact during the restoration process. The results of these experiments are fed into special computer software created by Dr. Gerhard's research group. This software allows the researchers to simulate all manner of contaminated sites, and to try out a wide variety of treatments. That way, when it comes to tackle the problem in the real world, it can be done efficiently and with the most modern and cost-effective techniques.

"Among the four fundamental forces that are known to exist in nature, gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces, only the weak interaction violates parity. When parity is violated, the results of an experiment differ from those obtained with an experiment that was set up as its mirror image. The work proposed here involves studies which use the weak interaction between subatomic particles as a probe for their fundamental properties. The experiments use high intensity neutron sources and particle accelerators to either search for very small spatial and yield asymmetries in the products of the reaction between the projectile and a given target, or to measure with high accuracy the properties of particle (i.e. neutron) decay products. The type of asymmetries we measure can only emerge as a result of the weak interaction being part of that reaction. The fact that only the weak interaction violates parity, and its short range, makes these measurements highly useful probes of very small effects inside nucleons. The currently accepted mathematical and phenomenological description of our knowledge about the interactions between subatomic particles is known as the Standard Model. Although highly successful, there are strong theoretical reasons, such as the large number of adjustable parameters, to expect that the Standard Model is a low energy effective theory of some more fundamental description of nature. A Canadian research group, consisting of the universities of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Northern British Columbia, and TRIUMF, Canada's laboratory for nuclear and particle physics, has initiated a Canadian program in fundamental neutron physics experiments to investigate the properties and possible extensions of the Standard Model. The program will consist of measurements using cold neutrons, conducted at the Spallation Neutron Source in Oak Ridge, Tennessee and of measurements using ultracold neutrons, to be conducted at TRIUMF and Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico.  These world-leading new facilities will permit us to carry out a program of ultra-precise measurements of weak interactions of the neutron.

"Our current understanding of the interactions and properties of subatomic particles is described by the so called Standard Model. The model currently combines the electromagnetic interactions, the weak interaction, and the strong interactions into one framework and has enjoyed extensive success in predicting experimental results over the past 50 years. The weak interaction drives the decay of neutrons into protons and lies at the heart of energy generation in a star. The strong interaction acts between subatomic particles called quarks and binds neutrons and protons (nucleons) into nuclei. Despite its success, it is apparent that the Standard Model is only an approximate description of the processes that drive interactions at the subatomic level. Among many reasons supporting this assertion are the fact that the model has many parameters which enter the theory in an ad hoc manner,  as well as the glaring omission of gravity from the interactions it describes. The verification of all aspects of the Standard Model and the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model are therefore currently at the leading edge of subatomic particle physics research. A group based at the universities of Manitoba and Winnipeg has initiated a Canadian program in fundamental neutron physics experiments to investigate Standard Model predictions. The work proposed here involves studies which use the weak interaction between subatomic particles as a probe for their fundamental properties. The experiments use high intensity neutron sources to search for very small asymmetries in the reaction between the projectile and a given target. Measurements of these asymmetries are highly sensitive probes of very small effects inside nucleons. This proposal requests funding for the construction of helium 3 ion chambers which will be used for precise measurements in neutron capture and decay processes. Since the weak interaction between nucleons is predicted within the Standard Model, but modified in an unknown way by the strong Interaction, the proposed measurements of asymmetries in the neutron capture processes are Standard Model tests in their own right.

"Fluorine is the most reactive element. Its reactivity makes possible to prepare small, structurally simple molecules that would be unstable without the presence of the element fluorine. Basic studies of molecular structures help chemists check the validity of theories; theories that are applied to a host of practical problems, from new materials to pharmaceuticals. The proposed research will involve the preparation of novel compounds that have sulfur and fluorine surrounding a central metal atom. These so-called sulfide fluorides are the starting point for the study of their reaction chemistry. Since sulfur complexes are found in biological systems, such as ferredoxins, the influence of fluorine on the nature of those sulfur complexes will be investigated. The potential use of sulfide fluorides is as catalysts in the petroleum industry. The combination of these sulfide fluorides with other metal cations is expected to result in larger aggregations. If it is possible to increase their size, these compounds could be used as materials. The utilization of sulfide fluorides as fluorination agents will be studied and may result in their use in the pharmaceutical industry to prepare fluorinated drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil as a drug against breast cancer and the antidepressants fluoxetine and paroxetine, which have been proven to possess remarkable potencies. These inorganic sulfide fluorides will be characterized, among other means, by NMR spectroscopy in the solid state. This characterization technique is still in its infancies for fluorine-containing compounds. The proposal pursues the extension of solid-state NMR spectroscopy to a large variety of inorganic fluorine compounds.","Physical sciences","Inorganic & Organic Chemistry"

"We are requesting an equipment grant to replace the current pumping system of our dilution refrigerators with newly designed dry pumps sold by Alcatel. This urgent replacement is absolutely needed for Gervais team to continue their research on the 5/2 fractional quantum Hall state, which is by far  the most promising candidate for a proof-of-concept of the non-abelian anyons.  This study is carried out in the very best semiconductor heterostructure available, grown at Lucent Technologies (Dr. Loren Pfeiffer, now at Princeton). In 2008, we have shown, in collaboration with Das Sarma, that the intrinsic structure of the 5/2-state, or gap, cannot be accounted for by current state-of-the-art numerical studies. We are now in the process to extract the spin polarization of the 5/2 FQH state, a measurement which, in conjunction with the e*=e/4 charge measurement of the fractional charge by the  Weizmann and Harvard group, could nail down the non-abelian nature of the 5/2 state. For us to succeed, urgent assistance is needed from NSERC  for the replacement of our dilution refrigerator main pumps which have been so problematic that we were unable to obtain new data on the 5/2 state this year.

"In recent years, the electronic properties of low-dimensional structures such as electrons 'trapped' in quantum  wells (2D), flowing in a quantum wire (1D) or forming a quantum dot (0D), have drawn a high-level of interest for both fundamental aspects and promising device applications.  As the temperature of the electrons present in these structures is reduced toward very near absolute zero, totally new properties emerge from a competition  between many-body electron-electron interactions, disorder, and fluctuations. Examples of interest  include 'bizarre' phenomena such as the fractionalization of charge excitations in 2D, fractional (abelian and  perhaps non-abelian) quantum statistics in 2D, as well as the  separation of spin and charge predicted to occur  in 1D. These phenomena cannot be understood in terms of classical or Boltzmann physics;  they  are the result of the subtle mechanics that emerge when quantum particles interact near T=0. Our group at McGill works at elucidating new quantum phases of matter 'on-chip' in semiconductor tailor-made electronic and fluidic structures.



Material-wise, we use extremely low-disorder GaAs/AlGasAs grown in the highest-moblity Molecular Beam  Epitaxy (MBE) facility in the World (Lucent), as well as the cleanest material in Nature, 3He near T=0.   We carry out measurements down to ~8 mK, in high magnetic fields up to 16T. In our laboratory, we develop and implement novel tools and techniques such as resistively  detected NMR with  'too few spins',  scanned probe microscopy, as well as optical techniques. Starting from raw semiconducting material,  we tailor-fabricate structures for electrons, or nanoholes for quantum fluids using cutting-edge clean room fabrication processes evolved from the nanotech community . In our laboratory, the search for  new quantum phases of matter occurs when the nanotech tools and low-temperature know-how connect with quantum physics.

"The formation of mature tissues or specific cells represents one of the most complicated biological processes that requires a coordinated gene expression program.  The initiation of the formation of a mature tissues is controlled by not only tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory proteins, but also by important cellular modifications at several different levels, more particularly at the level of chromatin structure.  The studies that I outline in this proposal are aimed at acquiring an improved understanding of how chromatin regulates genes important for cellular differentiation.  This proposal will first focus on adipogenesis, a differentiation system controlled by the nuclear receptor PPAR-gamma.  We will use different molecular and cellular approaches to characterise the role of chromatin structure in the regulation of gene regulated by PPAR-gamma during adipogenesis.  These studies will provide novel information on the as yet poorly characterised chromatin-related molecular mechanisms leading to the formation of a multi-cellular organism.

"Functional genomic analyses are providing data sets that allow hypotheses to be formulated on the therapeutic potential of proteins. Given the large number of protein activities and interactions that are predicted to be important for any given disease, it is difficult to determine the best targets for drug development. It is also too time consuming and expensive to initiate drug development programs against all these targets. To circumvent these problems, cost-effective methods are needed to rapidly validate targets that are important in disease-associated processes and that are susceptible to inhibition by trans dominant agents such as small-molecule drugs. The goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive platform for isolating cyclic peptides and antibody-like single-chain variable regions (scFvs) that interact with protein targets with high affinity and specificity. The proposal builds on previous technology developed in our laboratory, whereby we designed a novel genetic selection for rapidly isolating ""lariats"" that function as inhibitors of protein function. A lariat consists of a cyclic peptide or ""noose"" region with a covalently attached ""tail"" that contains a transcription activation domain. Combinatorial libraries of lariats, where the noose region is randomized, can be screened for interactions with a protein target using the yeast two-hybrid assay. In this proposal, the short-term objective is to develop methods to increase the stability and solubility of lariat peptides and scFvs. This will improve our ability to isolate these reagents against protein targets and to use them effectively as inhibitors for validating the therapeutic potential of proteins. The long-term goal of this proposal is to isolate lariats and scFvs against protein targets involved in regulating autocrine IGF-1 signaling in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and to use these reagents to identify novel targets to develop drugs for treating CML.

"Data networks such as the Internet have traditionally been designed in a layered fashion where each layer communicates only with the layers directly above and below it through predefined interfaces. A layered architecture has also been implemented for wireless networks mainly because of inter-operability issues with legacy wireline networks. However, it is well known that such a layered design may not be appropriate for wireless networks due to the specific characteristics of wireless medium, i.e. high error rate and large rate variability, which can negatively impact higher layer network protocols. In particular, it has been suggested that some interactions across different protocol layers can significantly improve the performance of wireless systems.



The objective of this research is cross-layer optimization of modern wireless data networks. Specifically, the goal is to improve TCP throughput by exploiting the information available at the protocol layers above and below TCP. The reason for focusing on TCP is that the majority of network traffic in both wireline and wireless networks is carried by TCP, and it is expected that TCP will remain the de facto transport protocol for a wide variety of applications in the future. Therefore, it is important both to understand its behavior, and to improve its performance in emerging wireless systems in order to provide better and more cost-effective wireless data services for end users.



To achieve this goal, the following objectives are set for this program:

(1) Characterizing TCP performance in modern wireless networks,

(2) Developing practical mechanisms to address TCP performance problems in such networks,

(3) Implementing the developed mechanisms to assess their performance experimentally.","Information systems and technology","Computing and Information Sciences - A"

"Volatility modelling has implications for asset pricing, optimal portfolio theory and risk management.  Volatility or the instantaneous rate of return of the underlying security was assumed to be constant up until 1982.  Ever since Robert F. Engle recognized the time-varying nature of volatility in 1982, there has been extensive research into extending his class of autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) models to incorporate additional salient features of financial returns data. Engle's recognition of the time-varying nature of volatility has made a significant impact in the theory of economics.  However, many statistical properties of the models proposed in volatility modelling research have yet to be studied and provide a wealth of research opportunities.    



The statistical properties of interest are moment properties, hypothesis testing, smoothing and forecasting of non-linear generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) models.  In order for valid conclusions to be drawn from statistical modelling, the underlying model assumptions need to be satisfied.  I propose to investigate data-driven methods for testing whether the model assumptions have been met. For example, the moment properties such as the autocorrelation of the squared process of the kurtosis can be used to identify the appropriate model. Hypothesis tests allow the analyst to quantify the uncertainty about model parameters while smoothing of estimates based on volatility models allows for improvements in estimation.  Derivation of forecasts and their standard errors allows for future prediction of volatility assuming the current economic conditions persist. By gaining insight into the statistical properties of volatility models, analysts will be better equipped to make informative decisions in financial practice.

"(1) Systems of Reinforcing Concrete for Strength and Ductility

A steel reinforcing bar in concrete can resist a force equal to its full yield strength only when it is positively anchored to the concrete. Conventional stirrups and crossties rely on hooks or bends for anchorage. However, where there is demand for the yield strength of the bar adjacent to a hook or a bend, experiments typically exhibit crushing or splitting of the concrete at the interface, accompanied by anchorage slip. Systems of steel reinforcement are developed for use in concrete in lieu of conventional stirrups and crossties. The basic component of the new systems is a stud with an anchor head at each end, capable of developing the full yield strength of the stud without slip. This anchorage quality makes the studs more efficient than conventional stirrups in providing strength and particularly ductility (essential for earthquake-resistant structures). Examples of applications of studs are: punching shear reinforcement in slabs, crossties in columns, walls and bridge piers, longitudinal bars in deep (or short) beams and corbels, and anti-splitting reinforcement at bearings and ends of prestressing tendons.



(2) Serviceability of Concrete Structures

This project aims at development of robust techniques of computing stresses and strains due to temperature, creep and shrinkage of concrete and relaxation of prestressing reinforcement and, accordingly, design the minimum reinforcement and its detailing to ensure satisfactory service life and durability. The work involves considering material and geometric nonlinearities, caused by cracking of concrete, yielding of reinforcement, presence of axial forces and use of unbonded or external prestressing tendons. The analysis considers the deformation up to failure of concrete members subjected to increasing load introduced after occurrance of creep, shrinkage and relaxation.

Principally, the minimum amount of heat during welding corresponds to the least influence on microstructure that leads to a better corrosion resistance. This should be accompanied by good matching choice of the filler alloy. Post-weld aging is recommended to avoid localized corrosion and SCC for heat treatable alloys. Two new promising composites (AA-6063 alloy containing 10.5 and 25% B4C respectively) with specific mechanical properties and advantageous abilities of neutron absorption will be considered and compared to the conventional Boral aluminum composite alloy material (AA 1100 mixed with boron carbide particles). These materials are commonly produced in the form of plates, sheets, rods and liners and used to fabricate the inside baskets of storage and transport containers in the nuclear energy production. The materials serve for nuclear criticality safety, structural support of the fuel assemblies and heat removal.

"The continuously increasing demand for energy has been translated into increased cost of crude oils, and intensified emission of green house gases. As a result, air quality will continue to deteriorate severely and global warming will increase beyond repairable extent. Renewable energy such as biodiesel and bioethanol have a much smaller net emission of green house gases. The use of biodiesel can reduce emissions (about 50-60%) of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and harmful air pollutants, in particular asthma-causing soots. However, the present economics of biodiesel process is highly vulnerable and depend mainly on governmental subsidies because the secondary product (glycerol) has lost its high commercial value due to present glycerol glut. On the other hand, diversion of high value oil crops such as canola and soybeans for biofuels production has raised some serious questions on sustainability of food supply in future. These factors have necessitated the need for the development of an integrated biorefinery approach for production of biodiesel and valuable compounds from waste based biomass rich in oil such as animal fat and fish oils. The long-term objective of this project is to develop an economically viable and environmentally sustainable innovative biorefinery process consisting of biological transesterification of animal and fish processing wastes into biodiesel and multitude of valuable products such as nutraceuticals (omega-3 fatty acids), enzyme inhibitors (alpha-2 macroglobulin, alpha-1 antiproteinase), enzymes (proteases, lipases), collagen, high value proteins and meal; and bioconversion of glycerol into propanediol, ethanol and lactic acid. The work consist of: compiling and analyzing information on sources and amounts of waste materials in the Atlantic Region, characterization of waste streams, investigating handling and pretreatments techniques, and developing feasible extraction/separation and fermentation techniques. The project will contribute to the socio-economic development of Atlantic Canada, enhance the economics of the biodiesel industry and accelerate carbon sequestration. Highly qualified personnel will be trained in the fields of bioenergy and process engineering.","Waste, waste management and recycling","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Energy"
"Conventional energy resources (coal, natural gas, oil) which account for more than 50-80% of total world energy demand are rapidly depleting and the cost of energy is increasing. Utilization of bio-based raw materials for the production of bioethanol can meet the surge in energy demand and play a major role in Canada's climate change strategy. In order to lower GHG emissions, the automotive industry, which produces >25% of all greenhouse gas emissions, warrants the use of at least 10% ethanol blends (E10). The Renewed National Biomass Ethanol Program has set a target to increase Canada's ethanol production capacity by 750 million litres (triple of current capacity) enabling as much as 25% of Canada's total gasoline supply to contain 10% ethanol (E10) by 2010. However, the existing technology is inefficient and substrate supply (use of the food crops) is not sustainable as the cost of substrate accounts for 70-80% of the total bioethanol production cost. Current bioethanol production systems are in competition with food supply and have reduced food security and raised food prices worldwide as reported recently by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Demand for food will double by 2050 and climate change will cause reduction in agricultural productivity and limit food resources. Thus, utilization of low cost alternative raw materials and screening for efficient lytic enzymes and ethanol producer microorganisms are important keystones that need to be adequately addressed. The long term objective of this project is to develop a biorefinery strategy for the production of bioethanol and high value molecules from fruit and potato processing wastes. The work consists of characterizing the waste streams, developing pre-treatment, hydrolysis, extraction, fermentation and separation techniques. The project will contribute to the socio-economic development of Canada, enhance the economics of bioethanol industry and accelerate carbon sequestration.

"The aerodynamic design of compressor or turbine blades is a crucial and very challenging part of any gas turbine engine design cycle. The present design process relies heavily on numerical simulations of variable fidelity levels. Therefore any improvement in the design methods and in their integration into one design system will have a significant impact on the design process. In this proposal inverse blade design and shape optimization methods will be developed for turbine and compressor blading in three-dimensional viscous flow; they will also be integrated into a design system where the blade shape is represented by the same parametric form throughout, that form is also accessible to CAD systems. This work will contribute to understanding the physical implications of the design variables and provide a quantitative assessment of their effect on the design; it will also contribute to reducing the design cycle time.

       In inverse blade design, some design parameters, e.g. the blades loading, their thickness distribution, and their stacking line are prescribed and the blade shape is then sought. Focus will be put on the robustness and consistency of the inverse scheme, and on assessing the effect of the design parameters on the loss-generating mechanisms such as secondary flow, horse-shoe vortex flow, shock-boundary layer interaction, tip-vortex flow.

       Shape optimization methods refer to finding the blade geometry that would accomplish a certain objective function, e.g. maximum efficiency and/or pressure ratio, while respecting certain aerodynamic and/or manufacturing constraints, e.g. minimum blade thickness, flow angles, etc ... The proposed research will focus on developing robust and effective optimization strategies for multi-point multi-objective problems, and make it accessible to the designer through a proper choice of the shape optimization variables.

       Upon its completion, this work will provide useful tools integrated into one aerodynamic design system for gas turbine blading and will facilitate its integration with other design systems in an industrial setting; it will also train qualified personnel that can effectively use these tools.",Aerospace,"Mechanical Engineering - B"

"We would like to conduct studies of chemical dynamics in room temperature ionic liquids and in sub- and supercritical fluids. Ionic liquids are almost completely made of ions, while a supercritical fluid is any fluid above its critical temperature and pressure where there is no distinct gas and liquid phase. Our studies, in the long term, will give us information that will be useful to design novel industrial processes that are both economical and environmentally-friendly. In particular, we will be able to contribute in finding the optimum thermodynamic conditions for supercritical fluid based processes or types of ionic liquids in ionic liquid based processes. For many of our studies we use muons which from a chemical point of view can be considered as light protons. We would also like to expand a new technique, laser-pump muon probe technique, that we have recently developed to study the Kinetic Isotope Effects of atomic hydrogen reactions in the exited states, to probe transients in ionizing radiation processes, as well as free radical intermediates in excited states. We would also like to develop other novel spectroscopic methods. One such method would be the development of electrochemical-muon spectroscopy techniques in order to produce novel reactive intermediates electrochemically, or using a combination of electrochemical methods followed by muon irradiation. We will then investigate the electronic structure of these reactive intermediates through the coupling of nuclei to unpaired electrons (hyperfine interactions) by muon methods. I will continue to use the interdisciplinary setting and state-of-the-art experimental tools at the two major facilities that we use, TRIUMF national laboratory in Vancouver, Canada, and Rutherford Appleton laboratory in the UK, combined with the computational chemistry methods and conventional lab methods to provide a unique training environment for undergraduate and Master students involved in this research program. For our research on supercritical fluids and ionic liquids, we will focus on providing mechanistic and dynamics information related to free radical chemistry and intermolecular interactions that are relevant to potential chemical and manufacturing industries.","Not available","Anal. & Phys.

"Advanced wireless communication systems need to have multi-standard multi-band capabilities to be more ubiquitous, mobile, agile and secure than they are today. This requires the development of software defined radio transceivers. So far, extensive research activities have been carried out to design the RP front-end of such multi-band tranceivers. This preliminary focused on the receiver design. Conversely, the transmitter side still a the early research and development stages. This research proposal aims at developing innovative all-digital RF multi-band transmitters for advanced communication systems using the latest semi-conductor devices technology. The targeted architecture is based on switching-mode RF power amplifiers that makes it possible to attain extremely high power efficiency levels.

The main objective of the proposed research project is to extend the digital and digital-like signals from baseband all the way up to the transmit antenna, the entire adaptability and reconfigurability of this approach will be exploited to extend multi-band operation from the established receiver side to the transmitter side. The research activities will cover (i) the development of device an system models for transistors and power amplifiers operating in switching-mode; (ii) the design and optimization of GaN based switching mode power amplifiers operating in class D, E, F and their subclasses and at frequencies ranging from L to X bands; (iii) the study and evaluation of system architectures suitable for all-digital multi-band transmitters; (iv) the design and fast prototyping of dual-band transmitters operating in L and S bands.

This strategic research project is sponsored by leading Canadian companies in high performance RF and microwave multi-functional sub-systems (Nanowave Technologies), and in wireless communication systems (Nortel Networks), and a worldwide leader in GaN based semi-conductor devices (Nitronex Corporation).","Information systems and technology","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Communications and Information"

"The history of the Earth's interior involves transfer of energy and matter between the interior and the surface. Some of the evidence for this history is found in metamorphic rocks that formed at the margins of the continents where the plates collide, e.g, eclogites and blueschists. Other sources of evidence include pieces of rock (xenoliths) brought up from depth by volcanic eruptions and large scale granitic intrusions. My studies in the Canadian Cordillera and elsewhere involve field mapping and sampling of these rocks with laboratory studies including microscopy and chemical analyses of the rocks and minerals. The data are used in combination with calculations based upon experimental data to estimate the pressure and temperature at which the rocks formed. The estimation of the pressure and temperature at which these rocks form provides information on: (1) the depth in the Earth at which the rocks formed; (2) the amount of uplift and erosion required to get the rocks to the surface; and (3) the variation of temperature with depth in the Earth at the time of metamorphism. Some of the matter transferred from the interior includes hot, water-rich fluids and igneous melts. Estimation of the composition of these fluids and melts is part of the study. Thermodynamic calculations and stable isotope studies can be used to estimate the composition of these fluids and melts. Another important part of this study is the timing of the metamorphic and igneous events and this is accomplished by dating the minerals using radioactive isotopes. All of these studies can be integrated and produce a comprehensive interpretation of the geologic history of large volumes of the Earth's crust and upper mantle.

"The long-term goal of the work proposed here is to understand the processes of regolith development and evolution on the Moon and Mars. The regoliths of these planets are important because they contain cumulative records of the physical processes that have occurred at each location over time. The ability to measure and interpret variations in regolith physical and chemical properties, and the processes that drive regolith evolution, is the key to unraveling the geologic histories of a planetary surface.  In addition, the regoliths of the Moon and Mars are important as potential resources for future landed robotic or human exploration.  In the short term, I will address these issues via three projects, all using radar remote sensing. Radar can provide quantitative measurements of key parameters used to characterize the physical properties of geological materials, and is particularly effective when used in synergy with other remotely sensed data.  For many planetary applications - particularly those relating to Mars - a thorough understanding of the interaction of radar with ice-rich materials is of key importance.  In light of these considerations, I will carry out the following three projects during the course of the current NSERC Discovery funding cycle.  1) Conduct geological investigations of selected targets on the nearside of the Moon using new high-resolution, multi-wavelength, dual polarization Earth-based imaging radar observations.  2) Investigate the shallow subsurface expressions of geological features on Mars, using orbital sounding radar observations.  3) In the field on Earth, quantify the interactions of polarimetric radar with ice-rich geological materials that can serve as analogues to planetary materials.

"One of the most interesting and attractive problems in physics is that of understanding how to make sense of a quantum theory of gravity. My long-term research involves strengthening and increasing our knowledge of particle and gravitational physics by considering specific questions connected with quantum gravity from the viewpoints of particle physics, noncommutative geometry and gravitational physics. According to our present knowledge, the best possible candidate theory for a quantum theory of gravity is superstring theory, which seems to exhibit good perturbative behaviours. In superstring theory, all the fundamental particles in particle physics and all known forces in nature are realizations of different states of the most fundamental object that is a one-dimensional string. However it has been known for some time that there are at least five distinct consistent superstring theories. It seemed that they simply exist with some dual relations between them although there was no known theory that explained why different superstring theories could have dual relations between them. In this regard, it was very difficult to determine which particular string theory describes our real world. Recent developments in non-perturbative string theory -- starting with the discovery of various extended objects in superstring theories (Dirichlet branes) -- have begun to cast light on this important question. It has become clear that these extended objects play very important roles in the strong dynamics of superstrings and in Membrane theory (M-theory). Superstring theories, when viewed in the strong coupling limit, are not just theories of strings but instead contain many extended objects (branes) as light degrees of freedom. The existence of these objects turned out to be the origin of the dual relations between different superstring theories. M-theory as it is called at present, is an eleven dimensional quantum theory of the many extended objects which produce all the superstring theories around its perturbative vacua. In this context my research plan will address current issues in particle physics, noncommutative geometry and gravitational physics that are inspired by string theory.

"For any one-variable polynomial f with complex coefficients, and any complex number x, we call the f-orbit of x, the set consisting of x and all of its images under iterates of f.

Complex dynamics studies properties of such orbits. Of particular interests are answers to questions such as:

1) When is the orbit living in a bounded set?

2) When is the orbit finite? For how many points x would this happen?

3) What can we tell about the common points for two such orbits corresponding to two different dynamical systems?

Question 1) generated the definition of Julia and Fatou sets, whose topology was the main topic of study in complex dynamics for many years in the past. Question 2) is easy to answer over the field of complex numbers. There are infinitely many points whose orbit is finite, and they are called preperiodic. However, if we restrict our attention to the preperiodic points living in a finite extension of the field of rational numbers, then finding all preperiodic points becomes a much harder problem. Question 3) turned out to be much more elusive for complex dynamics, because it involves solving equations such as f^m(x) = g^n(y) (for fixed f, g, x and y), where the unknowns are non-negative integers n and m (note that f^m and g^n are the iterates of f and, respectively g). Furthermore, the above problem can be reformulated as follows:

``Given polynomials f and g with complex coefficients, and given complex numbers x and y, are there infinitely many pairs of non-negative integers (m,n) such that the point (f^m(x),g^n(y)) belongs to the diagonal subvariety of the affine plane?''

Now this is a question in arithmetic geometry, and this is precisely one of the questions that my research addresses, as I am looking for answering number theoretical questions in the context of complex dynamics, with the use of arithmetic geometry.

"This research focuses on simple representations of complex data sets. Three specific problems of interest are data mining, finding a sequence of actions to achieve a particular outcome (planning), and maintaining a representation of one's location (localization). This work is applicable to numerous areas in which meaningful information must be extracted from extremely large and multivariate sequential data sets. In these domains, action taken at a data point (e.g. taking a treatment by a patient) has immediate effect on consequent observations. The goal is to find a representation in which the actions correspond to simple mathematical transformations such as translation and rotation.



On the more theoretical side, I propose to explore and formalize non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques as probabilistic models. I will address the problem of how such models should be constructed, and how they should respond when data is missing. This will work toward addressing two important open problems in the area: determining how to objectively evaluate a dimensionality reduction algorithm, and predicting how well an algorithm will generalize.

"The recent growth of botnet activity in cyberspace has attracted a significant attention of the research community. In today's Internet, botnets have become one of the biggest security threats, responsible for a large volume of malicious activities from distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to spamming and phishing.

The latest unprecedented growth of emerging botnets resulted in a number of the proposed techniques aiming to enhance botnet detection and mitigation. However, most of the proposed approaches had very limited success due to the lack of good understanding of botnet phenomenon on one side, and the quickly evolving strategies employed by botmasters on the other. In spite of the fact that the existence of botnet has long been known, the research community is still struggling to answer questions on the nature of the botnets and find the comprehensive solutions.

We propose to explore the problem of botnet attacks from two perspectives: the outside view of the botnet that relates to the actual botnet attacks and the inside aspect that often remains hidden and captures the nature of the botnets creation and use. We rely on visualization techniques to guide the process of botnet detection, understanding and mitigation. Specifically, we aim to develop a Hierarchical Network Application-based Framework for an Automatic Discovery, Visualization and Mitigation of Botnets (DVMBot). This framework will present a generic system for botnet detection & mitigation, independent of the botnet structure and the employed C&C protocols. Once deployed, DVMBot framework will provide a probabilistic analysis of botnet

presence in the current host/network and the following monitoring of the security status to ensure timely botnet detection and mitigation.

"Most medium and large-scale network infrastructures include multiple high-speed connections to the Internet and support many customer collaborative networks; thousands of internal users and various web servers. Many of these systems are faced with an ever-increasing likelihood of unplanned downtime due to various attacks  and security breaches.  In order to adequately protect these networks there is a critical need to be able to deliver systems that can  automatically detect intrusion patterns and performance bottlenecks, and automatically defend themselves. Due to the exponential growth in size, distribution, and complexity of communication networks, current intrusion detection/prevention technologies are not very effective against new attacks and have severe limitations as far as performance, scalability, and flexibility are concerned. Moreover, the improvements to these systems are  often too slow and too little to keep up with the innovations by the attackers. The main drawbacks of the  current intrusion detection systems are: 1) the large number of false positives; 2) the inability to detect unknown attacks; and, 3) the inability to properly assess the relative danger of the misuse and provide an appropriate response. There is a  general consensus that the primary focus of the intrusion detection technologies must be:  a) to reduce the rate of false  positives; b) to develop non-signature-based intrusion detection methods; and, c) work on prevention instead of detection. The primary objective of our research work is to identify a bank of models/tools/techniques that are well suited to address the above shortcomings. We will focus on developing: 1) algorithms for automatically detecting anomalies in flow or event streams; 2) automated rules tuning, learning and adaptation; 3) alert correlation and creation of graphs for multi-stage attacks; 4) automatic discovery of network applications; and, 5) simulation of network attacks.  A tool which allows simulation of attacks and `what-if' and `did you know' scenarios to identify security loopholes and assess preparedness, and is of great interest to network administrators.

"Recombinant proteins comprise an important class of biopharmaceuticals. Since these proteins do not occur naturally, they show significant tendency to self-associate into aggregates. Several factors such as high concentration, extremes of pH, high shear rates and thermal stress are known to encourage aggregate formation. Protein aggregates can be formed during cell culture, purification and storage. Clinically used proteins should be aggregate free since these are immunogenic and are known to cause adverse reactions in patients. Protein aggregation also plays a key role in human diseases such as ALS, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and variant Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease (vCJD), all of which involve aggregated misfolded proteins (AMP). The ability to detect and quantify protein aggregates is therefore important in both industrial and clinical applications. Currently used analytical methods are slow and inefficient. Recent  papers from the applicants research group have described hydrophobic interaction membrane chromatography (or HIMC) based methods for rapid and efficient separation and analysis of protein aggregates. These method were able to resolve monomer, dimer, trimer, tetramer and pentamer forms of recombinant monoclonal antibodies. However, the confirmation of identity of these different forms relied on slow off-line techniques such as gel electrophoresis. Multi angle light scattering (or MALS) measurement allows rapid and online determination of molecular size. The proposed purchase of a MALS detector would significantly enhance the capability of the HIMC techniques developed in the applicants lab and would overall lead to the development of extremely efficient methods for analyzing protein aggregates.

"Chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride are used in large volumes by various industries.  Uncontrolled or accidental discharges of chlorinated solvents into the subsurface at many industrial and military sites have led to extensive soil and groundwater contamination.  Chlorinated solvents are extremely toxic and even trace quantities in the groundwater render the water unsafe for use. At many chlorinated solvent-contaminated sites the sol- vents have polluted aquifers that are a source of water for the public or for industries. The Federal Contaminated Sites Inven- tory in Canada also lists numerous sites contaminated by chlorinated solvents where urgent action is needed.

Nanoparticles of zero valent iron (reduced iron) can degrade chlorinated organic compounds very rapidly to innocuous products such as ethane and chloride ions. This makes the nano iron particles an excellent reactant for eliminating chlorinated solvents in the ground at contaminated sites. Iron is ubiquitous in soils and thus iron is considered to be a safe product to be introduced in to aquifers. Recent studies have however shown that iron nanoparticles, when injected into the ground through wells, are able to migrate only a few feet from the wells because they get filtered out by the soil. Laboratory studies indicate that modifying the surfaces of the iron nanoparticles with polymers improves their mobility in groundwater. The proposed research will investigate, through controlled laboratory studies, the transportability, stability, longevity and reactivity of surface modified nanoiron particles in chlorinated solvent contaminated soils. Soil samples from chlorinated solvent contaminated sites will be used in the study. The research will help identify the conditions under which the surface modified nanoiron particles can achieve efficient and effective elimination of the chlorinated solvent compounds. The research will be conducted by an accomplished team of multidisciplinary environmental scientists and engineers. Golder Associates Ltd., a well-known environmental technology company will partner in this research project and intends to apply this technology at various contaminated sites.

"We have witnessed over the last decade or so a great demand for providing reliable high-speed wireless links to support applications such as voice, video, e-mail, web browsing, to name a few. The combination of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signal processing and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) seems to be an ideal solution for this challenge where bandwidth efficiencies on the order of 10 b/s/Hz are feasible for many of these applications. However, despite the great advantages MIMO-OFDM systems offer, such systems present challenges of their own. One of the most important challenges is synchronization, which is crucial in building reliable wireless communication systems. Synchronization includes time and frequency synchronization, and synchronization tracking. Some work has been done in this area, but most of this work has focused on single antenna wireless systems and little attention has been devoted to MIMO systems. Actually, most of the synchronization techniques that have been applied to MIMO systems were extensions of techniques developed for single antenna systems, and thus were not really optimized for MIMO systems. Even those schemes developed for MIMO systems were developed for generalized MIMO systems and not for specific MIMO applications. The implication of this is that a scheme that is optimal for one application may not necessarily be optimal for other applications. In light of this, we believe synchronization techniques optimized for specific MIMO applications are still lacking in the literature. Motivated by this, the PI plans to 1) develop techniques for time synchronization. An important element to this direction of research is to first develop design techniques for stable preamble (training) sequences; 2) develop robust carrier frequency offset estimation techniques with emphasis on reduced complexity schemes; 3) tailor the developed techniques to accommodate both centralized and distributed MIMO systems, as well as consider both the uplink and downlink channels; and 4) incorporate spatial and transmit data correlation into the techniques developed.

"A number of studies have shown that genetic factors may control alcohol consumption and that the endogenous opioid system may mediate, at least in part, the reinforcing effects of alcohol. The major objective of our previous studies was to determine the effect of alcohol on the release of opioid peptides (endorphin, enkephalin and dynorphin peptides) in brain regions associated with the processes of reward and reinforcement.  Our studies demonstrated that the effect of alcohol depended (a) on the amount of alcohol; (b) on the brain region; and (c) on the specific opioid peptide. In brief, it was observed that low to medium doses of alcohol increased the release of endorphins and enkephalins in brain regions involved in the processes of reward and reinforcement, while high doses increased the release of dynorphins.  Based on the knowledge that endorphins and enkephalins mediate positive reinforcing effects, while dynorphins mediate aversive effects it may be proposed that low to medium amounts of alcohol are rewarding, while high amounts of alcohol are aversive to the animals.  The first objective of the proposed studies is to provide an understanding of the significance of the ethanol induced changes on the release of opioid peptides on alcohol reinforcement. Thus, the impact of the ethanol induced changes on the release of opioid peptides will be determined by neutralizing the activity of the opioid peptides, through local application of their specific antisera in distinct brain regions, and estimating the changes in dopamine release (the release of which is increased by drugs of abuse) in relevant brain regions following an acute ethanol challenge.  The second objective is to test the hypothesis that chronic alcohol consumption induces deficits in the opioid activity of the brain, which may maintain high alcohol consumption through the processes of negative reinforcement.  Thus, the effect of chronic alcohol on the tissue content of opioid peptides, on their specific mRNAs, as well as on their extracellular levels in distinct brain regions will be determined.  The proposed studies will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation and maintenance of high alcohol consumption.

"The research program focuses on the study of surface properties of end-grafted polymers in order to develop smart and adaptable materials. The surface properties to be studied are the adhesion, the friction and the distance-dependence of the surface forces which play a major role in controlling the success and longevity of biomaterials and other functionalized surfaces. These surface properties will be directly measured using a surface forces apparatus (SFA), which is one of the most reliable instruments for the measurement and the identification of fundamental forces acting between surfaces. 

Although several studies using SFA and similar molecular techniques (i.e. AFM) have been carried out in the past for different classes of polymer-bearing surfaces, the lubrication and adhesion mechanisms are not clearly elucidated. The lack of systematic studies examining the influence of polymer properties and environmental conditions on the surface interactions is in part a result of the difficulty in controlling the polymer grafting density on mica which is the most reliable substrate for SFA measurements. We have recently developed different graft-to approaches to irreversibly attach polymers directly on plasma activated mica surfaces with a control in the grafting density. With these approaches, we aim to establish reliable correlations between physical and chemical properties of the end-grafted polymer layers (thickness, grafting density, degree of ionization, elasticity, surface roughness, chemical functionality), environmental conditions (ionic strength, pH, temperature, solvent condition, compression, shear) and surface interactions (friction, adhesion and distance-dependence of the forces) between polymer-bearing surfaces. These correlations will allow identifying the key parameters and mechanisms that are effective in controlling adhesion and friction between polymer functionalized surfaces.

"Despite their ecological importance, we know little about global or regional species patterns for most insect groups, particularly over time scales of a few decades. This ""biodiversity crisis"" limits us from

addressing questions (for insects) about presence of introduced or invasive species, vulnerability of species to human activities, and conservation of species and habitats. Data from large scale inventories are needed, but are difficult to obtain, due to high costs of inventories, lack of trained taxonomists, and high diversity (>66000 insect species in Canada compared to only a few hundred birds). We argue that the results from large-scale inventories already exist, but are hidden, due to a lack of co-ordination and sample processing in small museums scattered throughout the regions. Many insect collections in universities, government labs, and provincial natural history museums in the Maritimes extend over periods of >100 yrs, but most are dominated by specimens that have either not been identified or not been organized into accessible formats (i.e. a standard database). Tens of thousands of insect specimens fall into this category; if these can be processed and results made accessible, the data will become available to answer questions relating to human-based activities and ecological theory, and allow researchers to focus future collecting rather than duplicate past, but hidden, work.  We will tackle 5 major insect groups for which we have expertise in identification and training, and for which ecological and habitat requirements are known.  We will identify and database previously collected specimens from regional and national museum collections in our target groups, to begin the process of mining the ""hidden biodiversity"" information that already exists.  We will then use these data to identify faunal changes and their mechanisms that can be tested with other groups.  The main benefits from this study will be the curation of insect collections in regional museums (for reliable reference material), an accessible database for several large groups of insects (for ecological studies), and a group of trained taxonomists that can recognize new invasions and extend biodiversity work to other groups.

"The Paleozoic ""greening"" of the terrestrial surface as vascular plants colonized the landscape was among the most profound evolutionary changes in all of Earth history. Oceanic and atmospheric events during the early to mid Paleozoic have been widely linked to the spread of land vegetation, which decreased atmospheric CO2 , promoted global cooling, increased the runoff of nutrients to the oceans, and caused marine organisms to become extinct. Surprisingly, however, Paleozoic rivers barely feature in these discussions, even though early terrestrial plants colonized many river plains. Limited previous research suggests that, when river plains were unvegetated, channels inundated coastal areas with sand, but meandering rivers with muddy floodplains appeared in the Silurian as vegetation stabilized river banks. The present research programme aims to document river deposits through the crucial Cambrian to Devonian interval (540 to 360 million years ago), comparing the timing of events with what is known about the first appearances and abundance of early plants. Following a literature compilation, studies of river deposits and some of the world's earliest plant assemblages will be carried out at selected sites in North America and Europe. In younger Carboniferous rocks, we are studying the plants of river basins within mountain belts, in order to assess when plants spread into challenging inland areas: it seems, however, that they were there from the earliest days. We will also explore early evidence for wildfires, microbial contributions to river plains, and log jams that promoted channel switching once plants were sufficiently large and abundant.","Land, solid earth, seabeds and ocean floors","Solid Earth Sciences"

"The collision of continents, microcontinents, and island arcs at subduction zone boundaries is a fundamental mountain building process (i.e. orogenesis). The resultant geology of these mountain belts (orogens) includes a complex superposition of deformation and metamorphic events. My proposed research will focus upon investigating these interrelated tectonic processes associated with collisional orogens. In the Canadian Cordillera, my graduate students I and will continue to carry out a program of geologic mapping accompanied by microscope analysis in the lab of the structural and metamorphic elements. Another component of this research will include determination of precise timing constraints (geochronology) that are crucial for reconstructing the geologic history and developing tectonic models. Once the geologic relationships are rigorously determined via field-based mapping and microscope analysis, uranium (U) and lead (Pb) isotopes of radiogenic minerals (e.g. zircon, monazite) will be analyzed using a variety of geochronologic techniques. These include Isotope Dilution-Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ID-TIMS) and in situ analysis of minerals in thin section and grain mount using ion and electron microprobes and Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICPMS). My integrated approach to field geology and geochronology has proven to be very effective. I have provided highly precise and accurate age constraints for tectonic processes in the southern Canadian Cordillera, and have elucidated some of the complex crystal-chemical processes that plague radiometric minerals used for U-Pb geochronology. It is anticipated that the proposed research will refine our current understanding of tectonic processes associated with collisional orogens, and more specifically, the amalgamation and sculpting of the continental crust underlying the Canadian Cordillera.

"Areas of the boreal forest in northeastern Alberta are expected to be affected by acid deposition from the oil sands bitumen refining operations. Concern to minimize the impacts to the natural environment has prompted the industry, in cooperation with regulators, to consider future strategies such as improved emission controls. A better understanding of present and future acid sensitivity of the natural environment is acknowledged as necessary to design of appropriate cost-effective prevention strategies. This study centres on development and application of isotopic and geochemical tracers methods, in combination with classical hydrologic methods, remote sensing and GIS techniques, to constrain processes/interactions that control acid sensitivity of soils and downstream aquatic ecosystems. The study will improve on existing estimates of acid loadings, their variability in lakes and wetlands, and knowledge of critical future thresholds that are important to maintain ecosystem health. Knowledge of hydrologic flowpaths, surface/groundwater interaction, and flushing rates for lakes will be used to improve realism of models concurrently under development (e.g. Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments, MAGIC) to simulate time-to-effects of critical loadings in the region.",Water,"RPP Internal Decision Cttee"

"Although human speech is most commonly thought of in terms of ""sounds"", speech is also undeniably - and in some ways primarily - movement. However, despite advances in technology that readily allow direct observation of speech movements, the motor (movement-related) aspects of speech have remained relatively under-studied. The proposed research uses multiple methodologies, including medical imaging, perception experiments, and biomechanical simulation, to investigate the status of movement in speech. 

   Challenging the traditional ""speech as sound"" model, the proposed research program pursues the broad hypothesis that human speech is produced, perceived and categorized in terms of an array of available information, generally that which is most readily available and salient for speakers and listeners. This hypothesis implies that some speech ""sounds"" are best thought of as sounds, while others are in terms of their aerodynamic or somatosensory - or motor - characteristics (or any combination). The immediate goal of the proposed research is to test a sub-proposal of this broader research program: that at least some speech sounds are best represented as movement. Three hypotheses will be tested: 1) Some speech ""targets"" are most easily described in terms of movements; 2) How people move or hold their mouths affects how they perceive speech; and 3) Planning speech is more like planning other movements than previously thought. 

   What makes this research program unique is both its theoretical position, avoiding the pitfall of unitary representation, and its range of different methodologies. Many of the proposed techniques and methods have been developed or improved through our own previous work, and several of the proposed studies have already been piloted. This basic research has many potential implications, including: improved language learning and clinical intervention tools, better articulation-based speech synthesis, new means of diagnosing motor disorders, and new links between speech and motor development in children. Our lab continuously explores and develops all of these possibilities through collaborations with colleagues from across a range of fields.

"This proposal describes a comprehensive program of research into the design, analysis and implementation of algorithms for foundational problems in symbolic mathematical computation.  These are the algorithms that make commercial mathematical software like Maple and Mathematica run.  They allow us to manipulate and solve large and complex sets of equations exactly, even when some quantities are unknown and left as variables.

        My research will centre on three specific areas: solving sparse linear equations with exact rational numbers as entries, algorithms for approximate or ""noisy"" polynomials, and computing with ""lacunary"" polynomials (polynomials with high degree but only a few non-zero terms).  The common thread of the described projects is a focus on exploiting sparsity, the existence of lots of zeros or ""holes"".  In other words, if a very large problem we wish to solve has a very succinct description, we want to use this to make our algorithms run more quickly.

        As an example, a system of thousands of simultaneous equations, where each equation involves only three variables, should be solvable more quickly than a system where each equation involves thousands of variables.  Our algorithms and software will allow us to treat the enormous and sparse equations that now challenge us in symbolic mathematical computation and its applications.  I will also consider ""approximate"" equations, where some of the data involved may be imprecise or noisy (say from experimental data).  I will show how to reconstruct equations to model such data which are of small size, thus making subsequent operations faster.  Finally, I will explore the exciting theoretical world of ""super sparse"" or lacunary polynomials. Computing with these pushes the limits of algorithmic science, but also may lead to useful methods in practice.

        The algorithmic advances will be implemented in the symbolic linear algebra software library LinBox and in the computer algebra system Maple.  Both provide an avenue for broad dissemination of our methods.

"The research will examine perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) that are ubiquitous in the environment, including as yet unidentified PFCs so that their safety can be assessed. Because of their unique properties PFCs are being used more often and in greater quantities in manufacturing processes and products. PFCs are important and useful products, for instance in the electronics industry. PFCs are also persistent, bioaccumulative; some are toxic at environmentally relevant concentrations. In 2000, my research team identified PFCs in the environment for the first time. Since then we have developed instrumental methods to measure concentrations of PFCs in the environment and determined some of the critical mechanisms of toxicity of some members of the PFCs. Subsequently, we have developed bioassays to screen for effects of PFCs. The results of our research led to the cessation of North American production of some of the common PFCs, though they are still manufactured and used in Asia. Recently, we determined that less than 2% of the synthetic, organically-bound fluorine in the environment can be accounted for by known PFCs. That means that 98% of the potentially hazardous fluorinated compounds have not been identified. It is critical to identify the remaining compounds so that a comprehensive risk assessment can be made. We will develop and apply cutting-edge analytical methods to identify the additional compounds are to ascertain if they present hazards to humans or to the environment. We will both develop and apply novel analytical methods for the quantitative measurement of very low concentrations of known compounds; will develop and apply methods to measure total organically bound fluorine; and will identify previously undescribed PFCs in the environment. We will also use molecular biology and bioassay techniques to determine the mechanism of toxicity and relative potencies of both known PFCs -- individually and in mixtures of PFCs extracted from environmental matrices. Finally, we expect to be able to use the new estimates of hazard and risk of the compounds to assess their potential for adverse effects on humans and the environment.

"Our research program is centred on the development and application of on-line analytical techniques for the direct and continuous monitoring of key determinants of environmental and human health. The goal of this research is to provide direct sampling platforms that can be directly coupled to sensitive and selective detection systems, such as mass spectrometry to provide real-time, high precision measurements. Our research program has two thematic areas broadly characterized as 1) new directions in membrane introduction mass spectrometry (MIMS) instrumentation and 2) new applications of real-time analytical data. Membrane introduction mass spectrometry uses a semi-permeable membrane to pre-concentrate analytes while rejecting the bulk of the sample matrix allowing direct, on-line analysis without sample preparation. The 'faster, better, cheaper' analytical methods enabled by this research can be directly applied to the study of environmental chemistry, human exposure and material properties. For example, the ability to monitor trace contaminants in real-time in environmental systems (e.g. indoor/outdoor air quality, drinking water disinfection by-products) is of paramount importance in understanding health risks and rapidly mitigating problems when they occur. Substantially faster chemical identification and quantification in complex samples also has direct application in emergency response scenarios, quality control and clinical diagnosis. Consequently, our research program has direct significance for environmental quality and human health.

"Aquaculture continues to grow at an unprecedented rate of 8.8% per year since the early 1970's and this comes at a time when the harvest of wild-caught fish has leveled  off due to global concerns about over-fishing.  It is now clear that the growing market demand created in the world's seafood supply will have to be met by aquaculture.  Despite the potential for growth, there is continued pressure from regulators to limit expansion based upon public concern over environmental concerns as well as spread of disease from farmed species to wild species.  In addition, there is a public perception that the farmed species are fed growth-promoting and antibacterial chemicals that could become part of the food supply. One problem with the aquaculture fishery is the potential impact of processing waste on the environment.  Much of this waste is converted into fish meal, silage or fertilizers yielding very low returns on investment in the necessary facilities to produce these by-products. However, it is now known that certain fish proteins recoverable from processing waste possess potential human health benefits.  Dr. Marette and his team of researchers at Laval University have been able to link the presence of high levels of dietary fish protein (to date cod and Atlantic salmon) with a marked increase in insulin sensitivity in high fat-fed (obese) rats and humans. This is significant insofar as type 2 diabetes is related to obesity and has known to affect nearly 2 million Canadians. The thrust of this research project is to use edible aquaculture processing waste to produce metabolically bioactive peptides and to develop a new ""nutraceutical"" approach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes in humans. The commercial opportunity will be to use the bio-active nutraceuticals from farmed cod and Atlantic salmon to enhance insulin sensitivity in individuals prone to Type 2 diabetes.  At the same time, the utilization of aquaculture discards for nutraceutical production could divert waste materials into production of more profitable end-products.

"Parasitic roundworms (nematodes) are important agents of disease in both humans and animals. Such infections  are ubiquitous in livestock (cattle, sheep and goats) worldwide and are amongst the most economically important diseases to agriculture. It has been estimated they cost the North American cattle industry more than $2 billion per year. Roundworm control is dependent upon the routine treatment of livestock with drugs (anthelmintics) but many roundworm parasites are now resistant to these drugs making control increasingly difficult.This project focuses on a group of livestock parasites called Haemonchus.There are a number of different species of Haemonchus that live in the stomach of livestock feeding on blood and causing anaemia. These parasites originated in Africa but have spread around the world with livestock movement and, although originally adapted to the tropics, they are now spreading to more northern latitudes including Canada, Western Europe and Scandanavia. This project will develop DNA based tests to detect and identify these parasites. These tools will be used to determine which Haemonchus species are most important in cattle, sheep, goats and wildlife in different regions of the world and in different situations.As well as studying these parasites in tropical regions, we will investigate the spread of the parasite through livestock and wildlife in Canada.We will also use DNA-based techniques to detect drug resistant parasites by detecting mutations in the parasite's DNA that confer resistance to an important class of drugs. We will study how these resistance-conferring mutations are spread between parasite populations. One particular concern is the risk that these mutations could spread from one parasite species to another. This is a particular worry in livestock because drug resistance is extremely common in sheep and goat parasites but is only now emerging in cattle parasites. Consequently we will investigate whether there is  spread of drug resistance between sheep and cattle parasites. This project will provide important information needed to control the development of drug resistance and prevent the movement of parasites into new regions and wildlife populations.

"Our sensory systems are capable of extraordinary feats.  We can visually distinguish subtleties in the faces of identical twins or recognize a friend at a distance based on details of their gait.  A sophisticated auditory system allows us to determine that a stranger was raised in another province or to avoid an onrushing car based on auditory cues of which we are largely unconscious.  To make sense of the external world, our nervous systems use complex networks of neurons in which the specific patterns of neural connections (synapses) and the precise strengths of those synapses critically determine our ability to interpret our sensory environment.  Perhaps surprisingly, the precision in these sensory circuits is not hard-wired, but rather is achieved through the interplay of environmental and genetic factors in early life.  These neural circuits first appear as imprecise networks of diffusely distributed synapses and inappropriate connection strengths and then undergo ""synaptic plasticity"" during early development to attain the organization of mature sensory networks. 



Many of the synaptic mechanisms that sculpt neural circuits are directed (to strengthen or weaken individual synapses) by the inputs (neural activity) to the synapse. Neural activity can thus be seen as a coded script that directs developmental plasticity. In order to understand this process, we need to know not only the decoding algorithm (ie synaptic mechanism, which many labs are now studying), but also the script. The research proposed here aims to identify the patterns of neural activity in the developing brain.  This information will guide us in asking further questions, such as:  How does the neonatal brain represent an auditory stimulus through neural activity?  How does this representation change with age? and ultimately What types of inputs most effectively shape neural circuits?

"The long-term objectives of my research program focus on understanding phylogenetic relationships and the influence of hybridization on the evolution in flowering plants.  My research is focused primarily on the large grass tribe Poeae and the largest grass genus Poa, commonly known as bluegrass, as the model for these studies.  Poa is one of the most taxonomically challenging genera of flowering plants; its complexity is thought to be due to extensive hybridization and polyploidy, further compounded by morphological reduction and the paucity of useful characters for identification.  Our previous research successfully used molecular data to construct a framework of evolutionary relationships within Poa and among related genera.  Using this phylogenetic hypothesis, along with a careful consideration of morphological characters, we recently presented a preliminary extensively revised classification scheme for Poa, the first with world-wide coverage for the genus.  We made progress towards unraveling its complex history of intertwined lineages by identifying cases of ancient and relatively recent hybridization, both within Poa and between it and other genera.  I now propose to test the robustness of our phylogenetic hypothesis and classification by sampling additional DNA regions and broadening the geographic and taxonomic coverage.  Multiple taxonomic levels will be examined, from speciose groups within Poa up to the tribe level, and cases of hybridization will be identified and explored in detail.  Our aims are ultimately to understand the evolutionary history, diversification, biogeography, morphological and breeding system evolution in this ecologically successful, species-rich group of plants, to provide a sound phylogenetic framework for worldwide revisions, and to further our understanding of reticulate evolution and hybrid origin in flowering plants  Economically important as nutritious and palatable forage, lawn and pasture grass, soil stabilizers, and cover crops, information gained can also be useful in applied applications such as agronomy, land reclamation, and conservation management.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Evolution & Ecology"

"Biomaterials are becoming increasingly important in the development of new strategies for diagnosing, preventing, and treating disease. For example, significant advancements are being made in the use of biomaterials for delivering drugs to therapeutic targets, replacing and stimulating the growth of tissues, and imaging disease processes. A major challenge in this research area is to impart the materials with the desired biological functions, while at the same time retaining important properties such as biocompatibility. The proposed research program involves the use of organic and polymer chemistry approaches to design and synthesize new biomaterials with improved properties and novel biological functions. One goal is to develop methods to prepare surface functionalized and biodegradable vesicles. These vesicles have a wide variety of potential applications in imaging, drug delivery, and therapy. A second project involves new macromolecular contrast agents that can be used for magnetic resonance imaging of biological processes and diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. A third area of research is the development of antibiotics that act by selectively disrupting the membranes of bacterial cells. Overall, this research program aims to design new chemical tools for biomaterials research with the goal of preparing new systems for the treatment and diagnosis of disease.

"Frustration in condensed matter physics arises when a system cannot minimize its total energy by minimizing the energy of each pair of interacting degrees of freedom independently from each other. Both uniformly and random frustrated systems are ubiquitous in condensed matter physics. Examples range from magnetic and superconducting system, to biological membranes and proteins. Geometric frustration arises purely from geometrical constraints imposed by the system considered. Random frustration results from the frozen-in (quenched) random disorder that is always present in any real material, and which create randomly competing or ""randomly frustrating"" interactions. Because geometric and random frustration is so common, it is important to understand on a theoretical footing their effects in real materials. This is the focus of this research proposal. For example, problems to be tackled in this research program include:



1) Identify and understand the microscopic mechanisms that give rise to seemingly quantum mechanically disordered (""spin liquid"") state in antiferromagnetic materials where magnetic moments (spins) reside on the sites of a lattice of corner sharing tetrahedra.

2) Understand how the presence of a certain kind of random disorder (called random fields) inhibits phase transition driven by quantum mechanical fluctuations in magnetic systems subject to a magnetic feld.

3) Understand the properties of the lowest-energy (i.e. ground state) of strongly disordered magnetic systems called spin glasses.

"Neoichnology is the study of how animals interact with sediments. This includes animal burrowing, walking, and living within sediment. Fossilized tracks and burrows are known either as trace fossils or as ichnofossils. The study of trace fossils is very important, because it has been shown that animals behave differently under various environmental conditions; therefore, fossilized traces help interpret the nature of a depositional environment. This proposal will explore the potential for trace fossils to provide very detailed sedimentary information from the rock record. The goal is to look at trace fossils in sedimentary rocks and infer from those, sedimentation rates, salinity, turbidity, and nature of the food resources available. Although answering all of these questions will be difficult, it is likely that aquaria experiments can help test animal responses to high sedimentation, turbid water, alternating salinity, and fluctuating oxygen. It is further proposed that we observe animal-sediment interactions in modern sedimentary environments to provide more accurate data. It will be required that the models evolved from aquaria and outdoor locales be applied to examples in the rock record to test the viability of infering detailed data from the rock record.

     Another goal of this proposal is to apply the study of ichnofossils to reservoir settings. The importance of this research is due to the fact that animal burrows can be pervasively present in hydrocarbon reservoir rocks. Moreover, animal burrows change the permeability of the rock in and adjacent to the trace fossil. This causes the fluid flow in many reservoirs to be complicated. The difficulty of fluid flowing through such rocks can cause valuable resource to be left undeveloped, and in the worst case, resource may be isolated by recovery techniques and rendered unexploitable. My research will establish some basic science in this area. I want to find out how many trace fossils in a given volume are required to make the ichnofossils a considerable parameter in resource development. And, I want to start trying to establish whether or not the distribution of trace fossils is predictable enough to provide a model for their distribution.

A large source of examples of noncommutative spaces is given by the quotient of equivalence relations.  I.F. Putnam, C.F. Skau and I have extensively studied the noncommutative spaces associated with minimal homeomorphisms on a Cantor set. In collaboration with H.

Connes and Woods defined a new property of ergodic theory called approximate transitivity (AT) to characterize a class of von Neumann algebras. They also noted that the Poisson boundary of some random walks is AT. Recently D.E. Handelman and I developed dimension spaces, a measure theoretic version of dimension groups. We will continue the study of the Poisson boundary of random walks using dimension spaces and will apply it to von Neumann algebras. 



One of most important recent developments in the classification of C*-algebras is Elliott's classification program of amenable C*-algebras. Its starting point was an example by Blackadar of a non approximately finite (AF) sub C*-algebra of an AF algebra. I want to study the real C*-algebra equivalent to both Blackadar's example and Elliott's program.



Many properties of von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras translate in properties of their unitary groups, in some cases considered as discrete or as topological groups. I plan to continue the study of such correspondences for classes of both C*-algebras and with Ping Ng of von Neumann algebras.

"At a critical time of energy dependence and environmental awareness, improved transformative processes in every aspect of industrial development are required. Whether it be emissions remediation ((e.g. deNOx, or deCO), production of key chemicals (e.g. ammonia), or production of energy (as in fuel cell technology), oxide and oxide-supported catalysts play a key role. Obtaining a fundamental understanding of the mode of operation of these materials will help improve existing technology. For example, a solid oxide fuel cell design resistant to carbon and sulfur poisoning, and which operates at relative low temperatures, could be produced at a fraction of the current cost and be utilized in niche applications (like factories or remote location housing) producing energy with high efficiency and a very small carbon footprint. 

   Due to their potential in heterogeneous catalysis as well as in the solid oxide fuel cell industry, the focus of this project will be the study of the molecular-level processes occurring on the surface of the catalysts. The objectives of the proposed research program are to establish structure-reactivity relationships and study intermediates in situ to answer some key questions, such as: what is the role of the support?, what are the active sites?, what are the reaction mechanisms?, what are the intermediates and how do they interfere with the reaction? Even in the extremely high loading cases used in the electro-catalysts of fuel cells, issues regarding active sites, mechanism, and intermediates remain unclear. 

   The experimental approach involves the preparation and testing of porous ""real"" catalysts and of model single-crystal catalyst. These materials will be fully characterised for electronic and morphological structure using diffraction, spectroscopy and microscopy techniques and tested for activity in reactor or fuel cell setups. The comparison of structure-reactivity relationships obtained for model catalysts and for real catalyst provides a rationale for catalyst design.

"Many animals look for their food in groups and this type of foraging raises a number of important questions that have been at the heart of my research program for the last ten years. When animals forage together, individuals can avoid investing effort in searching for food by waiting and then taking the food found by others. When does it pay to wait and scrounge?  What factors make this behavior common or rare? These questions are at the center my research program and can be addressed using a mathematical technique borrowed from economics called game theory. With game theory I can predict how many individuals should scrounge and how many should search. Using use small cage birds I found that depending on circumstances individuals change their investment in one and the other foraging mode. Now I propose to study how an individual's characteristics limit its use of one and the other alternative, the mechanisms it uses to adjust its individual investment in each alternative, how having to look for several types of prey that are difficult to detect affects its use of either tactic. The same principle applies to gathering information, some individuals sample while others get the information by watching them sample, that is they use public information. I propose to use video and audio playback techniques to explore how and when individuals use visual and auditory public information. The spontaneous emergence of individuals that exploit the efforts of others, whether for finding food or collecting information, has been and will continue to be of interest to a wide range of fields, including those that study human behavior (anthropology, economics, psychology). Because exploitation is one of the main barriers to the emergence of cooperation knowing how to control it would provide a major advance of knowledge.

"The cell cytoskeleton is a dynamic structure that is targeted by several anti-cancer drugs to arrest cell proliferation. Upon stimulation, a significant re-organization of the cytoskeleton occurs in a variety of cells. The present research program focuses on one cell type of the immune system, the mature non-dividing neutrophil that is a key player in inflammation. Especially, re-organization of the cytoskeleton occurs in activated neutrophils during different cell functions, including adhesion, locomotion, respiratory burst, degranulation, phagocytosis and apoptosis. As we have recently documented in these cells, several, but not all, cytoskeletal proteins are cleaved by caspases in spontaneous or agent-induced neutrophil cell apoptosis. This suggests the existence of a regulated control mechanism. The main objective of the proposed research program is to elucidate the role of the different cytoskeletal structures (microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules) in the general cell biology and physiology of the neutrophil. Our research interests focus on the inflammatory response by studying the neutrophil cell physiology in response to a variety of molecules such as drugs, cytokines, plant lectins and even environmental contaminants during inflammation in vivo as well as during ex vivo and in vitro activation.

"According to the International Panel on Climate Change, the Arctic will be the most affected region on Earth by the increase of greenhouse gases. Because of the permanent snow and ice cover, the Arctic is extremely vulnerable to rapid modification of its climate. In this research, another important factor contributing to modify the Arctic climate is investigated, anthropogenic aerosols. The Arctic can be very polluted during winter despite its remote location. The atmospheric circulation during winter favours the preservation and transport of large concentrations of sulphate, soot, and organic compounds over the Arctic. These aerosols can modify the formation and evolution of clouds, which are very frequent over the Arctic during winter. In turn, clouds regulate the amount of terrestrial radiation reaching the surface, thus contributing to either warm or cool the surface. This research aims at improving the simulation of the interactions between aerosols and clouds. A new indirect effect of sulphate aerosols, namely the dehydration-greenhouse feedback (DGF), is also investigated. The DGF could contribute to cool the Arctic during winter, thus partially counteracting the warming due to increasing greenhouse gases.

"A sector of the brain is active when a person is reading, listening to music, or doing any other activity. This activated region of the brain needs more nutrients and oxygen that come from the blood.  To regulate this increase in blood supply associated with neuronal activity, a phenomenon called NEUROVASCULAR COUPLING, the brain uses complex mechanims. These mechanisms underlying neurovascular coupling have been the subject of enquiry for more than a century, and numerous vasoactive factors derived from neurons and ASTROCYTES have been implicated in neurovascular coupling. Astrocytes are a specific type of brain cells which comprises about half the brain but were thought to play no role in brain processes. Recent important discoveries showed that astrocytes are involved in neurovascular coupling by linking, anatomically and functionally, the brain's neurons to blood vessels. In the present proposal, we HYPOTHETIZE that carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO), two gases derived from astrocytes and neurons respectively, induce vasodilation by acting on astrocytes. This concept is very innovative because it is generally assumed that these two gases diffuse to the vasculature to directly induce a vasodilation. However, astrocytes are anatomically closer to the sites of NO and CO release and our very exciting preliminary results showed that NO increases calcium in astrocytes, a mechanism that induces vasodilation. We will study the effect of NO and CO on neurovascular coupling using isolated cells and tissues as well as living animals. The isolated cells and tissues will allow the understanding of mechanisms at the molecular level and the living animals will permit to verify the functional significance of the results we get from isolated cells or tissues. This approach will give an integrated understanding of neurovascular regulation from molecular interactions to the whole animal.The LONG-TERM GOAL of the present proposal is to enhance our understanding of how neural activity is related to blood flow.

"The objectives of my research program are to study the ecology of overabundant bird populations and to evaluate different management measures within the general framework of adaptive management. Monitoring the establishment of an increasing bird population such as the Giant Canada Geese in southern Quebec will contribute to further develop population regulation theory. In the next 5 years, I propose to determine the relative effects of survival, reproductive output, and immigration on population growth. The breeding population of Canada Geese in southern Quebec offers a unique opportunity to determine when and how density-dependent effects will take place.  More specifically, I propose to determine whether nest-site availability is becoming a limiting factor on the Varennes islands and which demographic parameters are influencing population growth. Second, I want to verify whether the moult migration of temperate-nesting geese from southern Ontario and north-eastern United States is linked to immigration of birds into the breeding population. My third objective is to explore the mechanisms and adaptive significance of brood mixing in Canada Geese. Finally, I want to evaluate the impact of repeated nesting failures on bird dispersal. The need and the proposed measures to conserve endangered species usually generate wide consensus among scientists, stakeholders, and the public. In contrast, the management of overabundant wildlife populations does not usually engender such consensus about both the objectives and the means to achieve them. Knowledge about the relative effects of survival and reproductive parameters on population growth will help managers to make decisions about which parameters to influence through management.","Wildlife management","Evolution & Ecology"

"As the size of magnetic material becomes smaller, its magnetic anisotropy has to be proportionally increased to avoid thermal effects. This puts attention to magnetic materials with high magnetocrystalline anisotropy that cannot be reversed with magnetic field pulses produced with conventional technologies. I propose to study magnetization reversal in single domain magnetic materials with large magnetocrystalline anisotropy and to develop new methods for fabrication of these structures. By combining magnetic layers with different anisotropies, exchange stiffness and magnetization, I will study nonuniform magnetization reversal in single domain magnetic materials and test existing theoretical models. In magnetic materials with large magnetocrystalline anisotropy, not only 3d electrons, but also 4d, 5d, or 4f electrons contribute to the magnetic order. Laser pulses can coherently reverse magnetic moments that originate from 4f electrons and thermally destabilize magnetic moments that originate from d electrons due to their position with respect to the Fermi level. This will be used to achieve femtosecond magnetic reversal in transition metal-rare earth magnetic materials. A polarized spin current passing through a nanometer size magnetic material induces a spin torque that is collinear with the damping. This spin torque effect will also be used to study relaxation and reversal in magnetic materials with large magnetic anisotropy. In order to control nonuniform magnetization reversal, all three dimensions of the magnetic material have to be below several tens of nanometers. Periodic arrays of nanometer-size magnetic materials and nanopillar shaped samples will be fabricated by e-beam lithography from epitaxially grown multilayer structures.

"Materials have always been the corner stone of any evolution of technologies especially in the field of aerospace, energy and environment. In many cases, they have limited and are limiting factors in any new process design. The continuous evolution of technologies is necessary to compensate for higher labour and raw materials costs as well as for higher and higher environmental and societal costs.  Today, the need of higher efficiency and cleaner devices such as aerospace turbines or the need to convert more efficiently the energy using Solid Oxyde Fuel Cells puts a lot of pression on the discovery of new materials.  Indeed, proposing advanced materials such as advanced coatings for more challenging applications requires more and more research effort as the simplest solution are already applied. However, for coatings, composition changes can not only affect the material itself but can affect the relation between the coating and the coated part. Furthermore, micro and nanostructures can change drastically coatings behaviour and properties.  So there is the need to develop materials libraries adapted to coatings using the unique in the world combinatorial thermal plasma synthesis process which has been developed at the Centre de Recherche en �nergie, Plasma et �lectrochimie of the Universit� de Sherbrooke (CREPE).  This fully automated technology is one answer to give to coatings development a fast enough development pace to follow the more and more powerful computer tools system and process designers have on hand.

The proposed project addresses the scientific content of the combinatorial technology, especially it aims at implementing the data storage and data mining, to address some technological limitations by doing a process mapping, to apply this technology to new classes of coatings synthesis and to broaden its scope by developing the combinatorial thermal plasma nanopowder synthesis.

"How did the planets form? When and where? Were there ever other planets in the outer regions of our Solar System, and is it possible that there still are?  What can the distant satellites of the giant planets tell us about the formation of these jovian planets?  How do we combine the knowledge of studies of our own Solar System with the information we are gathering in studying disks and planets around other stars?  How did the small-body populations of our Solar System form and evolve?  Does their current size distribution tell us anything about how 'planetesimals' and then planets formed?



This NSERC grant will support a suite of research related to these questions. The puzzle of the overabundance of elements heavier than helium in the gas giant planets will be explored via large-scale numerical simulations of orbital dynamics to study how small objects are delivered to the growing plaents. This topic is one of the very few avenues to decide between the two main theories of giant planet formation.



In order to address the issue of whether even larger dwarf planets are present in the distant outer Solar System, I propose to conduct telescopic surveys of huge areas of sky made possible by modern mosaic CCD cameras on world-class telescopes.  These surveys will be the first large-area studies to be sensitive to large distant planets beyond 100 astronomical units.



The issue of the chronology of the impact bombardment and the nature of the mysterious ``lunar cataclysm'' will be approached via dynamical studies that use a wide variety of cosmochemical and spacecraft data.  The exploration of this question may necessitate the development of a lunar science package to be emplaced on the Moon.

"My overall research objective is the development of a comprehensive methodological framework for computational and mathematical modeling of complex distributed systems at high levels of abstraction as required for the early software development phases to ensure that the key system attributes are properly established and well understood prior to actually building the system. Focusing on semantic rather than syntactic aspects, the identification and elimination of design flaws and undesirable side effects requires precise models of the expected system behavior and the use of such models for analyzing functional system properties, test case generation, and runtime verification. 



This research proposal focuses on formal aspects of software technology, industrial applications of formal methods, computational modeling and validation of public safety and security systems and spatiotemporal characteristics of crime patterns. Building on solid theoretical foundations, the emphasis is on applications of knowledge and skills to solve practical problems in a range of diverse application domains. A common challenge in all of the research activities is the need for bridging the gap between formal and empirical approaches. Addressing practical needs requires novel ideas for combining mathematical concepts and formal methods with computational techniques that work in practice. 



Exploiting the experience from extensive applications of the Abstract State Machine (ASM) method to the specification and validation of distributed and embedded systems, the proposed approach strives for a combination and systematic integration of the ASM modeling paradigm with other paradigms for analysis, modeling, validation, and verification of behavioral aspects of complex concurrent and reactive systems in real-life application contexts.

"To be recognized as evidence of life, microbial fossils must contain chemical and structural attributes that are unique indicators of microbial cells or cellular processes.  In spite of the diversity of potential biosignatures, it remains enormously challenging to demonstrate the biogenicity of microfossils and microbial sedimentary structures.  There is, however, a growing consensus that microorganisms contribute greatly to the development of sedimentary deposits. I propose to focus in particular on iron-rich sedimentary rocks to look for evidence that microorganisms had a key role in their formation.  Iron is an essential element for all life, which has evolved an intimate dependency on iron's unique chemistry. For the iron-oxidizing and iron-reducing bacteria, however, iron plays an additional key role in respiration.  The change in iron's chemical state consequent to respiration leads to the formation of new mineral phases. Reactive iron may also be generated indirectly through the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria.  Regardless of the source, it appears that under some circumstances iron acts to preserve the bacterial cell wall, leading to entombment and eventual fossilization.  I propose to investigate the role of iron and sulfate respiration in the preservation of bacteria and the genesis of microbial fossils, together with the graduate and undergraduate students that my NSERC Discovery grant will support.","Earth sciences","Solid Earth Sciences"

"During the last fifty years, global nitrogen fertilizer use has climbed to approximately 100 billion kg per annum at a cost of about 50 billion dollars. Much of this fertilizer is leached from the land and swept into rivers and oceans, where it causes considerable environmental damage to natural populations through blooms of microrganisms. Their rapid growth reduces oxygen levels in coastal waters e.g. in the Gulf of Mexico, where this periodically results in large fish kills. The increasing population growth and degradation of agricultural lands worldwide can only exacerbate this problem in the coming years.

My research focusses on the physiological and molecular mechanisms that regulate nitrogen uptake by plant roots. Membrane transport of nutrients is a fundamental part of the biology of plants; it is also of considerable practical importance from an environmental and economic standpoint. Root nitrate uptake is mediated by a 50 kDa membrane protein common to organisms from fungi to higher plants. We have shown this protein (nrt2.1) requires the participation of a second smaller protein (nrt3.1). We have successfully expressed the two proteins in a fungus (Aspergillus nidulans) in order to study the basis of the protein interactions using site-directed mutagenesis. We will use fluorescence microscopy to explore interactions between fluorecently tagged recombinant nrt2.1 and nrt3.1 proteins and immunoprecipitation to verify the proposed dimeric functional unit. Related to this project we have shown that the fungal nitrate transporter is regulated posttranslationally, probably by an allosteric mechanism involving protein phosphorylation. Using site-directed mutagenesis of the fungal protein we seek to further explore this regulation. We are also investigating the functions of the five root amt1 ammonium transporters in Arabidopsis. We have experienced some preliminary success in increasing dry matter yield in tobacco by overexpressing nrt2.1 and nrt3.1. It is feasible that the knowledge we gain may enable us to make further improvements. My research involves collaborations with scientists in Canada, Australia, Scotland, Iran and India and we regularly receive visiting scientists and graduate students at UBC.

"Biological and physiological systems display a wealth of complex rhythms. Previous work demonstrated how comparatively simple theoretical models account for complex dynamics in well-controlled model experimental systems.  Despite these successes, a deep understanding of most naturally occurring biological rhythms has still not been achieved. In particular, fundamental issues arise in understanding dynamics in gene, cardiac, and neural networks. In our research, we develop equations that represent large numbers of interacting elements, spatial heterogeneity, noise, and compare theoretical predictions about dynamics with experimental observations. 

 

This research is timely since technological advances in molecular biology and cellular biology, have led to revolutionary progress in the observation of dynamics at a cellular and subcellular level. However, we still need theoretical methods to further our understanding of the dynamics in the complex networks underlying and regulating biological systems. Our results should enable development of inverse methods to determine networks governing expression of gene control based on observed activity patterns, development of methods to control or modify neural and cardiac rhythms, and also clarify potential mechanisms that can lead to onset of abnormal rhythms in physiological control systems.  Finally, by improving our understanding of normal dynamics, we will try to develop new strategies for analyzing and controlling abnormal dynamics.

"Glutamate is the major excitatory synaptic transmitter in vertebrate central nervous system and therefore all over the central nervous system the agent is stored in and released from vesicles. It subsequently diffuses in the synaptic cleft and interacts with post-synaptic receptors. It is thus critically important to understand how it is transported in the confined space and how it interacts with the receptors. Several approaches were tried in the past to simulate diffusion of transmitters in the synaptic cleft and their interaction with post-synaptic receptors. However, recent molecular dynamics simulations revealed unexpected complexities, such as layering of glutamate and water molecules near the wall of the confined space. As a result of layering the interfacial glutamate-synaptic wall interactions become very important in slowing diffusion. Glutamate and water molecules are not only layered but are also ordered near the wall. Proposed studies should evaluate how such ordering affects the glutamate binding to AMPA receptors, which should enhance our understanding of such processes on the atomic scale. Not only diffusion constant but a variety of other factors, such as cleft width and length, kinetic rates of gating of AMPA channels, number of molecules released, influence the amplitude and time course of miniature fast-excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs), and thus the quantal size, which together with the quantum content determines the synaptic efficacy. They also influence their current fluctuations, but differently. This will be explored in detail by simulations and experimentally in rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Moreover, it is now clear that the mEPSCs and their current fluctuations are kinetically rich. This raises an exciting possibility that the values of at least some factors shaping mEPSCs can be evaluated from individual mEPSCs, if the amplitude of an mEPSC, its rise and decay time, but also its current fluctuations, are considered simultaneously and fitted to the model of its generation.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Integrative Animal Biology"

The Elsa-Keno Hill mining district is found on the Silver Trail, about 45 km from the town of Mayo in the Yukon Territories.  The Keno Hill district, historically, was one of the biggest producers of silver in Canada. The district is made up of about 35 individual mines which were worked between 1913 and 1989 but most of the tonnage in the district came from just 10 deposits.  Most of the mines are following single veins which are about 1m wide on average (the widest vein mined was less than 10m wide).     )	

The deposits are formed by the movement of metal-bearing hot water (hydrothermal fluids) through fractures which then deposit silver, lead and zinc bearing minerals along with the carbonate mineral, siderite.  There also seems to be an earlier phase of fluid flow which deposited quartz and sometimes gold also in fractures but the relationship between these veins and the silver bearing veins is unknown.  In fact, the age of both vein types is also unknown.  It is thought that the water in both systems may have been heated by the intrusion of igneous bodies such as the Roop Lake granite which is found about 35 km away from Elsa-Keno Hill. 

The aim of this project is to determine the chemistry of the hydrothermal fluids that formed the vein deposits and the temperatures at which they were formed.   We will determine if the same fluids formed the silver and gold bearing veins and we will attempt to use a new rhenium-osmium dating technique to date some of the minerals in the veins.  This will mean that we can demonstrate if there is a genetic link with the nearby igneous intrusions.  This will further the understanding of where and why the mineralization forms in the veins and will help the company (Alexco Resources Corporation) to explore for more mineralization on their property.

"The total value of all mineral commodities mined in Canada, including metals, non-metals and coal, increased to $26.4 billion in 2005 and, thus, the mining industry is a significant contributor to the Canadian economy. This proposal is concerned with studying a range of ancient hydrothermal base metal mineral deposit types. Although these deposits formed in the past at different temperatures and depths in the Earth's crust all of them were formed by large volumes of hot water. These fluids contain significant amounts of dissolved chlorine, which formed complexes with the metal ions and allowed them to be transported by the water from the metal source regions to the area where the ore deposit formed. In such ore deposits, droplets of the mineralizing solution can be trapped in minerals as fluid inclusions and retain evidence of the chemistry of the mineralizing fluids and the environment in which they formed. The research proposed here is concerned with the continued support of a new laboratory dedicated to the analyses of these ancient fluids and in particular the study of the chlorine, bromine and chlorine isotopic composition of the fluids.  These techniques have been successfully used to recognise the source of chlorine in mineralizing systems and, in some cases, also the source of the fluid itself, which allows us to constrain models of how a particular base metal deposit was formed. 

    )	Over the next five years, these and other techniques will be applied to different base metal deposits including three advanced exploration projects in Northern Canada (Blende, Wernecke Mountains, Yukon; Gayna River, Mackenzie Mountains, NWT and the Great Bear Magmatic Zone, Canadian Shield, NWT). A combination of halogen chemistry, chlorine isotopes, and other geochemical techniques will be used to fingerprint distinct packets of fluid in these systems and constrain potential fluid flow pathways and the duration of the flow events.  These studies will improve our understanding of the origin of these mineral deposits and, thus, have a direct impact on exploration strategies for hydrothermal base metal deposits in Northern Canada.

"Fatigue failures are the cause of over 90% of all premature failures of mechanical and civil engineering objects such as airplanes, pipelines, bridges and ground vehicles. Therefore, the primary tasks in satisfying high level of safety and sufficiently long service life is an accurate estimation and prognosis of fatigue strength and durability of machines and structures subjected to irregular cyclic loads. Inadequate frequency of periodic inspections and incorrect assessment of the fatigue damage may result in unexpected catastrophic collapse. On the other hand, the cost of premature retirement of healthy mechanical components and too frequent inspections and service interruptions reaches on the national scale hundreds of million of dollars each year. 

For these reasons, accurate evaluations of fatigue damage and fatigue durability of engineering objects are necessary and, according to contemporary methods, the assessment of the fatigue crack initiation time period and the time length of the safe fatigue crack growth stage. Two different approaches, based on completely different physical and material models, are at present used in practice. Both of them are difficult to use and they require making subjective decisions resulting in frequent errors and confusions. Therefore, it is proposed to develop a unified fatigue prediction model applicable to smooth, notched and cracked machine and structural components. The model developed will avoid the necessity of arbitrarily dividing arbitrarily the fatigue process into several stages. Such a model, applicable to constant amplitude loading spectra, has been developed and successfully validated as a part of the ongoing NSERC Grant. It is proposed to extend the constant amplitude model for realistic, variable amplitude service load spectra in room and high temperatures and aggressive environments. Therefore a new material memory model adequate for modelling of non-stationary growing cracks needs to be developed and added in order to enable quantification of so called 'stress history effects'. It is also proposed to add a probabilistic simulation module enabling the estimation of the accuracy of predicted fatigue lives and the assessment of safety and reliability of analysed objects.

"The deployment of 3G networks (UMTS, CDMA 2000,     PackCable) along with the related service architectures has just started. Research has now shifted to post 3G networks. However, very little is being done on the related service architectures. This proposed research program is devoted to the service architectures for 4G. In the proposal we use the world wireless research forum (WWRF) definition of 4G (i.e. co-existing/co-operating legacy and new networks. On the one hand we use 3G networks as use cases for legacy networks. On the other hand we use mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) as use cases for new networks. Architectures for creating, deploying, using and withdrawing end-user applications/services in stand alone MANETs, stand alone WSNs, and integrated 3G/MANETs/WSNs/ are investigated. Functional entities, algorithms and interfaces are proposed and validated. Mathematical analysis, prototyping, and simulation are used for validation and performance evaluation. The architectures rely on a panoply of technologies such as context awareness, clustering, overlay networks, peer to peer and mobile agents. These technologies are exploited to the fullest possible extent. Furthermore, whenever necessary, we investigate how to extend them.","Information, computer and communication technologies","Computing and Information Sciences - A"

"This research program aims to enhance knowledge of the environmental fate and effects of commercial chemicals and to develop better methods for measuring & assessing chemical exposure and risks to wildlife & humans in support of national and international initiatives to protect human and environmental health. Previous research involved the role of physical-chemical factors controlling the bioaccumulation of chemicals in aquatic and terrestrial food-webs. The proposed research investigates the role of biotransformation on bioaccumulation in food-webs. The lack of methods to measure biotransformation rates and the subsequent lack of biotransformation data for most commercial substances have now been identified as a key scientific knowledge gap in the on-going evaluation of the fate and effects of chemicals in the environment. The goal of the research is (i) to develop methods for determining the rate of biotransformation of chemicals in in-vitro and in-vivo studies and (ii) to investigate the relationship between biotransformation rates measured in in-vitro and in-vivo studies and in the field and (iii) to develop and test mathematical bioaccumulation models for metabolizing substances that can be used for regulatory purposes. The research includes 4 projects involving a common set of chemical substances. Project 1 includes the development of a novel in-vitro dosing system to measure in-vitro biotransformation rates of extremely hydrophobic substances in liver and intestinal homogenates. Project 2 develops and applies methods for measuring in-vivo biotransformation rates in rats and rainbow trout. Project 3 involves the development of a pharmacokinetic model for relating in-vitro and in-vivo biotransformation rates. Project 4 develops and tests a food-chain bioaccumulation   model for substances that undergo biotransformation. This research produces benefits to (i) wildlife and human health (by identifying harmful substances), (ii) chemical manufacturers (by improving regulatory chemical evaluation protocols), (iii) environmental consulting industry (by establishing know-how on biotransformation test protocols, and (iv) supports the Canadian government in their national and international initiatives of chemical stewardship.",Environment,"Evolution & Ecology"

"Our research uses the techniques of quantum mechanics as implemented on computers to predict reliable energetic, structural, and spectroscopic data for molecules . The extension and validation of selected computational approaches is a necessary prerequisite to ensure the reliability of the theoretical predictions on excited states or for transition states for which experimental information is often unavailable. One part of our research examines the ability of unrestricted density functional theory to describe singlet biradicals. Comparisons are made with more conventional multi-configuration self consistent field approaches for ozone and its reactions. Time dependent density functional theory and CASSCF/CASPT2 are used to study the structures and electronic spectra of biologically important molecules such as oxyluciferins. Effects due to interactions with solvent and/or an enzyme active site are being included. Density functional theory is being employed to study reactants, intermediates, transition states and products for the ruthenium catalyzed addition of alkynes to alkenes such as norbornadiene.    

    )	In summary, the three current areas of research in our group are: unrestricted density functional theory for the description of the biradical reactions of ozone, theoretical organic chemistry and in particular transition metal catalyzed cycloadditions of alkenes and alkynes, and the electronic absorption and emission spectra of biologically important molecules such as oxyluciferin.

    )	The short term goals of our research are refinement of computational approaches especially for reactivity and excited states and inclusion of the effects of  solvent or of the active site. Our predictions on more complex systems  with carefully calibrated theoretical models  will interpret and or predict the results of specific reactions of importance in chemistry. Our longer term goal is to  move theory further towards a full partnership with experiment in studying chemistry.

Matroids are structures which are more abstract than graphs, which are vital to the understanding of geometry, rigidity, and good algorithms for optimization problems.  My research is aimed at understanding the fundamental properties of such structures, with an aim toward optimizing various parameters of interest.  For example, the problem of assigning shows to venues at a film festival can be modeled as a type of graph colouring problem.

The code cloning that is detected in this proprietary software, then needs to be categorized according to why it was introduced into the system, and on the software engineering merits of this deliberate or unintentional code cloning. Having developed a taxonomy to classify the different ways in which code cloning arises in commercial systems, we then wish to extend and enhance existing tools developed by us, that when presented with large software systems perform an assessment of the degree of code duplication within these systems, and the merits of that duplication. We also wish to develop tools that automate the reduction of source code, so as to remove cloned code, without altering the external behaviour of that code when this cloned code is deemed to be undesirable.","Computer software","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"

This will be achieved by exploring the management of difficulties that occur in trying to manage, plan and orchestrate the development of massive amounts of software.  We will seek to integrate a variety of different tools designed to assist in this process, so as to achieve greataer synergy between them, with other software responsible for documenting, describing, and managing the overall IT infrastructure.



We will build upon existing infrastructure from both industry (e.g., Rational Insight, Cognos, DB2, Eclipse, Tivoli Change and Configuration Management Database) and open source development (e.g., CVS, Bugzilla, mailman mailing lists, git) to add a layer of ""intelligence"" concerning software development that spans multiple kinds of artifacts and tools (e.g., project build, management, budgeting, modeling, calendar and communication tools).

"Sensemaking is a term from cognitive psychology that concerns trying to understand a situation in the presence of ambiguous, contradictory, and complex data.  The term is often used in the context of military operations, where there are three main interrelated activities:  forming an awareness of the relevant key elements, forming an understanding of what it means to act on this information within a particular bounded context, and making (and later evaluating) appropriate decisions. 



Understanding how and why software evolves involves many of the same kinds of activities.  While the initial development of a system may result in a set of artifacts that document the requirements, architecture, design rationale, and even anticipated future evolution, these artifacts are often not ""maintained"" carefully as the system evolves.  Consequently, managers and developers must use a variety of ad hoc techniques to recover information about the current state of a software system;  they use these techniques to better understand the nature of their particular tasks, and to have a more informed world view about the technical space of software 

evolution. 



This research program will expand my previous investigations into various properties of evolving software.  There are two main thrusts: 

(1) creating a better understanding of the various phenomena, both internal and external, that affect how software evolves, and 

(2) directed techniques for ""sensemaking"" in the presence of uncertain and complex data.","Information, computer and communication technologies","Computing and Information Sciences - A"
"Virtual worlds within which multiple users can engage, meet, and explore have become commonplace.

Some of these worlds offer rich environments with which users can interact, in which they can

create, and which they can alter.  These changes persist, as in the real world.  With ever improving

performance and capabilities of standard computer, graphics, and network technology, more of these

worlds are rendered in 3D in ever increasing realism, and provide a compelling, immersive

experience.  (4D refers to 3D plus the aspect of time.)

    While many multi-user virtual worlds are games, such as EverQuest, Eve Online, and Final Fantasy,

arising from the gaming industry, others are no longer games, per se, but social networks, such as

Habbo Hotel, Second Life, The Sims Online, and There.  Some offer rich environments in which users

can create, and even sell their virtual creations to others.

    As the technologies behind virtual worlds continues to improve, these worlds will become richer, 

and become more than just entertainment.  They will become regular social meeting places, training

centers, educational hubs, shopping malls, and informational kiosks.  Virtual worlds will change how

we interact, work, and search on-line.

    Many technologies underlie virtual worlds.  The state of a virtual world is essentially a database.

In this research, we address key challenges that virtual worlds raise for database systems.  We

research how to adapt and improve database systems to support better virtual world platforms, to

make them operate more efficiently and more robustly, how to scale these worlds effectively for

greater numbers of concurrent users and greater content, and to support richer content and vistas

"The coming years will almost certainly revolutionize our understanding of the fundamental interactions.  The  Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN Laboratory near Geneva Switzerland is opening up a new high energy frontier as the highest energy particle accelerator ever built.   The current theory of the elementary particles and their interactions is referred to as the Standard Model.  Although it explains all known phenomena involving elementary particles it leaves several fundamental questions unanswered:  What is the mechanism which gives particles mass (technically known as electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB)), why is there so much more matter in the universe than antimatter, and what is the dark matter in the universe? The purpose of the LHC is to answer these questions and to search for physics beyond the standard model.  Canada has made a significant investment in this project with well over 100 experimental physicists in Canada contributing to the LHC research program.  Theoretical support for the Canadian experimental LHC program is important to maximize the scientific return on this investment. In my research I study theories of physics ""Beyond the Standard Model"" and predict the experimental signatures that will indicate that new physics has been discovered and devise experimental strategies for the physicists performing the experiments.  I am  building up expertise and developing tools for doing LHC calculations so that if something unusual is observed I can apply these techniques to analyse the experimental results and suggest further measurements to identify the underlying theory. Some of my research uses these approaches to distinguish between the different theories proposed to give particles mass.  Other projects focus on developing strategies to to search for and identify exotic particles predicted by new theories. My research provides the theoretical input that is necessary to fully exploit the physics potential of the LHC.

"Within populations, individual animals (including humans) differ to varying degrees in their behaviour and reproductive success.  Despite recent advances, much work remains to elucidate the mechanisms generating and maintaining such variation, and the consequences of the latter for the processes of selection and evolution.  Towards meeting this challenge, the current proposed research aims in the short term to ascertain the extent to which social context (social factors) influences the behavioural decisions of individuals that live in social groups.  More specifically, I propose to investigate the potential influences of certain important social factors on: (i) the tendency of females to copy the observed mate choice of other females (i.e. mate-choice copying behaviour) and thereby on the intensity of sexual selection, (ii) the formation and maintenance of particular social associations among individuals and the implications of such associations for social networks in natural populations and for the intensity of sexual selection, and (iii) risk-taking behaviour (i.e. ""boldness""), as measured by tendency to explore novel environments and approach predators, and the relationships between boldness and correlates of individual fitness (e.g. growth rate).



I will use a number of model fish species and the experimental and comparative approaches, in both the laboratory and field, to test hypotheses about context-dependent behaviour that are based mainly on contemporary sexual selection, social learning, and behavioural syndrome theories.  The proposed research will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how natural and sexual selection are mediated by social factors and how they interact to shape behaviour and maintain variation in behaviour within populations.  As such, this research will provide further insights into the processes by which animal behaviour evolves.

"There is an ever-growing need for novel and more powerful quantitative analytical techniques used to explore the complex world of biological systems.  In the last decade or so, new microfabrication technologies have begun to bridge the gap between silicon processing and biology, enabling the design of micro- and nano-scale sensors used to detect biological matter with unprecedented levels of sensitivity.  Moreover, micro- and nano-fluidic technologies allow for the manipulation of extremely small volumes of biological matter, ultimately increasing efficiency, reducing costs and providing access to new phenomena.  This research program will offer new tools and methods for the detection and analysis of biological material, including biomolecules, viruses, bacteria and other types of cells.  Research into the development of new microfluidic biosensing platforms will be driven by the need to provide novel approaches to detection for various applications including medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, rare cell screening (e.g. circulating cancer cells), pathogen detection (e.g. food safety), environmental monitoring, as well as for enabling new measurement capabilities used to conduct fundamental studies on biological systems.  This program will see the design of novel microfluidic platforms capable of both manipulating and detecting complex biological samples.  This multidisciplinary effort addresses a dynamic and exciting area of research.  While initially application-driven, these technologies will also encourage collaborative efforts by providing new quantitative and real-time analytical techniques complementing existing approaches used in biology to study cells.  Moreover, this program will offer unique opportunities to HQP, providing training in experimental physics, microfabrication, surface chemistry, mechanical/electrical engineering, cell culture, single cell biology, etc.  This interdisciplinary training in bio-nano-technology will provide HQP with a broad set of invaluable skills and knowledge empowering them in their future careers.

"Our research program addresses two main directions. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) and text mining. Our first research direction is to pursue ongoing work in the field of FCA and applications, in particular data mining applications. FCA can be viewed as a hierarchical conceptual clustering approach that reveals the significant patterns of commonalties and relationships within tabular data based on the formal framework of Galois (or concept) lattices. Pioneered by Wille and myself in the early eighties, this field has largely expanded and it has become over the last ten years a well established discipline with an elaborated theoretical basis, a large array of applications (data mining, bioinformatics, software engineering, information retrieval, linguistics, psychology, ...) and software tools (commercial and open source), and a growing international community. In the next grant period, we plan to focus on data mining applications within the following main themes: multilevel association rule data mining condensed representation, complex data mining, approximate condensed representations and incremental frequent pattern mining for performance optimization in data warehouses. 

Our second main research direction is text mining and information retrieval applications. Much of the available electronic information is in the form of text. The Web is an obvious case. Text mining is concerned with extracting useful representations from textual data. These representations are used in information retrieval and text classification applications in particular. Typical single term indexing and weighting schemes suffer from their inability to systematically exploit co-occurrence patterns that are often more close approximations of the underlying concepts. We are working with several approaches that extract significant co-occurrence patterns. More specifically, our work exploits genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks and frequent set mining algorithms.

"Modern physics is composed of two well-tested theories : quantum mechanics and general relativity. Quantum mechanics explains the behavior of particles while general relativity explains the movement of big objects as planets, stars and galaxies. Both are extremely good at predicting nature in specific circumstances. For example general relativity predicted the presence of black holes before any observational evidence. However, quantum mechanics only works when gravity is weak enough to be ignored. Similarly general relativity cannot explain the interactions of very small objects as electrons. But since planets and electrons live in the same universe, they should obey the same laws of nature. Hence physicists have been working towards a theory that encompasses both quantum mechanics and general relativity. This theory should explain compatibly the movement of planets and nuclear physics.

 

To achieve this theory of everything, string theorist argue that matter is not made of points but of small strings in various state of excitation. To understand how these small strings move through space and time, physicists need to consider the space of loops in our universe. As loops are colliding and dividing, they form surfaces. For example a pair of pants represent two loops moving towards each other, colliding and becoming a single loop. Today, physically-minded mathematician study spaces of loops and its relationship to spaces of surfaces. These ideas led to powerful structure mixing the geometry of stringy spaces with the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. String topology wishes to study these stringy spaces in a purely topological setting.

"Organ formation, or organogenesis is one of the major events in animal development. During organogenesis several distinct cell types develop and arrange into a regular and reproducible spatial pattern. These morphogenetic processes determine structure, shape and function of an organ. To study the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern morphogenesis I have chosen a genetic approach using the gonads of the fruit fly Drosophila as a model system. Gonads consist of germ cells that develop into eggs or sperm, and somatic cells that have multiple tasks in supporting the development of gametes. Extensive communication between germ cells and somatic cells through molecular signals is essential for normal germ cell development and maturation. Therefore, germ cell development relies on the normal development of somatic tissues, and mutations in Drosophila that affect the differentiation of somatic gonadal tissues are sterile. The analysis of such sterile mutants is an important tool to gain insights into molecular mechanisms of gonad morphogenesis. 

Here, I propose the further characterization of the Traffic Jam factor, a molecule that my laboratory has shown to be a key regulator of gonad development. This molecule is required for the normal association of germ cells and somatic cells in the gonads. The molecular function of this factor, which belongs to the family of large Maf transcription factors, is to control the expression of other genes. To understand how Traffic jam regulates the differentiation of somatic gonadal cells, my laboratory will identify and analyze the genes that are controlled by this factor and interact with this factor. This work will improve our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the spatial arrangements of cells and the differentiation of cells. Maf factors in mammals have been shown to play an important role in the development of blood cells and of major organs, such as hindbrain, eyes, kidney and pankreas. They have also been implicated in cancer. I anticipate that our study of Traffic Jam will help gain a better understanding of the function of Maf factors in general.

In this regard, the use of AI, especially techniques in the area of machine learning, are vital in helping humans cope with interpreting large and growing volumes of digital data.



Modern science has created the infrastructure to capture incomprehensibly large volumes of data, but the science of data interpretation lags our ability to capture data.  If there is a single simple theme of this research, it is to invent, investigate and experiment with machine learning and visualization to both guide the extraction of knowledge from large data volumes, and to be proactive in prioritizing the best kinds of data to capture.

The goal of this research is to improve dependability in software systems. We will focus on designing and building systems that allow analysis, detection and recovery from computer intrusions, software misconfiguration and software bugs. Traditional solutions have focused preventing the occurrence of these dependability problems, but unfortunately, these problems have no decisive solutions but are ongoing facts of life that must be resolved regularly. For example, a software system can be hardened endlessly but that does not eliminate the possibility of an intrusion. Instead, systems that allow detailed post-facto analysis and recovery can be made more resilient to software errors.



Our research approach consists of capturing, storing and examining the past events in a system, which allows building powerful dependability tools. For example, the past information allows analysis of problems that may have occurred in the past, and it also allows building system profiles that help detect problems as they occur. This information also allows recovery. For instance, events in the past can be replayed to reconstruct past states of a system, and by selectively replaying events, it is possible to rollback, isolate or recover from intrusions and other failures. It is expected that research in this area will help reduce the enormous costs incurred today as a result of buggy and vulnerable software.

"Gas bubbles exposed to ultrasound exhibit a rich variety of behaviours ranging from radial vibrations, to shape changes, to violent collapses with light emissions. Encapsulated micron sized 'microbubbles' are widely employed in biomedical ultrasound where they are used to enable blood perfusion measurements, perform molecular imaging, and to enhance therapeutic applications, such as blood clot dissolution. Their dynamics are dependent upon a variety of factors including their size and the amplitude and frequency of the ultrasound. The presence of a nearby boundary will also affect the behaviour of bubbles, making them more difficult to oscillate, and possibly creating fluid jets and asymmetric oscillations. This is currently the subject of considerable investigation under conditions that are relevant to microbubbles contained within the microcirculation, or adjacent to blood vessel walls. Basic bubble behaviour adjacent to thrombus has not been investigated. The work in this study will examine how ultrasound interacts with microbubbles adjacent to fibrin gels, which capture many salient mechanical aspects of blood clots. This will be done using a combination of high speed optical imaging and acoustic emissions monitoring. The results will produce basic insights relevant to understanding into the interaction between ultrasound, microbubbles and thrombus. This basic information is of ultimately of interest for applications of ultrasound imaging and ultrasound potentiated dissolution of thrombus. For example, the oscillation characteristics will determine how imaging should be performed to examine aspects of atherosclerosis and stroke. For therapeutic applications this will be relevant to understanding how drug transport into the clots occurs and may therefore assist in improving therapies for stroke and heart attacks.

"Positron emission tomography, or PET, is a nuclear medicine imaging technique which yields images of the biological distribution of a radioactive tracer that has been injected into a subject.  The most common clinical use of PET is in diagnosing and staging cancer because of its excellent sensitivity for detecting metastatic disease.  Unfortunately, PET is a very expensive imaging method because of the high cost of both the PET scanner itself and of the cyclotron produced radioactive dyes.  Improvements in PET system design that reduce per-patient cost can lead to more widespread use of PET and consequently improve the treatment of cancer patients through more accurate staging.  These system improvements are accomplished through basic research into new detector designs, processing electronics and data handling algorithms in engineering and physics research laboratories.  This Discovery grant will fund a research program focusing on developing and testing new technologies for PET imaging.  In the proposed research we will examine the sources of loss of image quality and quantification at low count rates in current generation PET scanners both through measurements and computer simulations.  We will use these results to aid in the design and construction of novel high sensitivity detectors for PET.  Increasing the sensitivity of PET detectors will lead to expansion of the use of PET in applications that have stringent limits of the amount of injected activity, such as pediatric imaging or in research studies.

"The ovarian hormones estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) control the ordered growth and differentiation of uterine cells. This remodeling process, which is modified by signals from the developing embryo, is critical for implantation, the formation of the placenta, and maintenance of pregnancy. Failure of uterine tissues to respond appropriately to ovarian hormones or the embryo results in defective placentation, associated with a spectrum of pregnancy disorders. These disorders are a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.  As well as their effects on the structure of the endometrium, P4, E2 & the embryo also regulate its function; for example, prostaglandin synthesis and the oxytocin receptor (OTR) during luteolysis and parturition. In vivo, the P4 produced during the luteal phase down regulates the OTR and prevents luteolysis from occurring too soon. However, the mechanisms involved in the action of P4 are not understood since downregulation of OTR by P4 in vitro is problematic. The first main objective of the proposed work is to understand the mechanisms of action of P4 in the endometrium of the cow. The interaction between multiple receptors, coactivators, and repressors within the different cell types of the endometrium involved in the regulation of OTR will be elucidated. The second area of research will examine the regulation and the action of two proteins, MIF and soluble E-cadherin, secreted from the endometrial epithelial cells. I have previously shown that secretion of these proteins is stimulated by interferon-tau, the embryonic signal responsible for the maintenance of pregnancy in the cow. It is hypothesized that they play a role in tissue remodeling prior to implantation. The significance of this work is that it will provide important basic information on the action of P4 in the endometrium and on interaction between the embryo and uterus necessary for implantation. In the cattle industry this could lead to ways of improving pregnancy rates, which will be of great economic benefit to Canada. The results of this work could also be relevant to human health and lead to a better understanding of parturition and a decrease in early embryonic loss.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Integrative Animal Biology"

"My research program is about control of the behaviour of large molecules, such as polymers and proteins, in solution. For example, by changing the concentrations of ions that are present, one can make long chains collapse into globules. One can also control whether or not they aggregate into interesting structures. We are interested in being able to design materials with specific properties using this kind of control at the nanoscale. To examine these effects, one has to work with many different types and combinations of molecules, and at different concentrations. The task appears daunting, unless one can do many experiments at a time. We have developed an approach that will allow us to conduct experiments at high throughput. The equipment requested, a microchannel plate reader, is important in this regard, in that it will allow us to look at a hundred or more experiments concurrently.

"Human activities are causing extinctions to occur at unprecedented rates. Although we often possess detailed knowledge about their causes, a dearth of information exists regarding the consequences of extinction for ecological systems. My research group and I work to understand how extinctions of large herbivores affect plant populations in African savannas. Our study sites in Laikipia, Kenya comprise an ideal system in which to study the ramifications of such extinctions. Laikipia consists of a 10,000 square km mosaic of private properties, where each property is associated with one of three scenarios reflecting the progressive, size-biased extinction typical of vertebrate communities: 1) elephant (~3000 kg) + impala (~70 kg) + dik-dik (~5 kg); 2) impala + dik-dik; or 3) dik-dik only. Using a series of semi-permeable, electrified fences, my research group and I are simulating the above extinction scenarios to address how large mammalian herbivores influence the abundance and distribution of Acacia trees, critical determinants of savanna fire frequency, nutrient cycles, and biodiversity. Specifically, we are working to answer the following questions: 1) How do extinctions of large mammalian herbivores change pollination of savanna trees?; 2) How do impacts of large mammalian herbivores on seed production, germination, and recruitment of savanna trees influence population growth of trees?; and 3) How important are large mammalian herbivores in driving population growth of trees, relative to variation in abiotic factors (e.g., rainfall)? To address the first two questions, my research group and I are combining field experiments with spatial statistics and matrix models. To address the third question, we are ""ground truthing"" projections from our matrix models across a five-fold gradient in rainfall in central Kenya. Thus, my research group and I will shed light on understanding the ramifications of extinctions for ecosystems. Moreover, through a combination of field experiments, long-term observations, and statistical modeling, we will develop and refine tools that predict the consequences of extinction for plant populations and communities.

"The techniques for generator protection and control are well established separately in technical publications and manufacturers' literature, but there are no techniques addressing the coordination of the two to date to the author's knowledge.  The purpose of the applicant's current research is to develop a unified concept for protection and control at the power system generation level. The specific objectives to achieve the above goal are listed below:

1. To apply  artificial intelligence techniques and pattern recognition techniques such as support vector machines (SVMs), principal component analysis, phase plane methods to achieve improved coordination between the protection and control functions using the generator capability curve analysis. 

2. To use Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS) compensation schemes for damping turbine-generator torsional oscillations (subsynchronous resonance).

3. To apply adaptive supplementary control techniques (radial basis function identifiers and pole-shift controller) to FACTS for effective damping of subsynchronous resonance, power oscillation damping, voltage control.

4. Closed loop testing of the protection and control functions on a power system using a real-time digital simulator, which is able to mimic the actual behaviour of a real system.



With the NSERC DG grant, the applicant intends to achieve a balance between theoretical and practical work for his graduate students. The findings from this research program will help in improving the standards for proper coordination of generator protection with control to enhance system security. He is optimistic that with his perseverance and zeal for innovative work, he will be able to contribute strongly in his research area and help in the advancement of Canadian and international research in power system protection and control.

"The proposed research is to solve for the design of welded structures, i.e., we no longer assume the design is given. Instead we assume that we are given in-service loads and a preliminary design with no weld joints specified. The analysis should predict the optimum position and size of all weld joints, weld procedures, weld schedules, fixture design and fixture schedule.  For an important class of welded structures, the primary failure mode is fatigue.  Given CAD files for the geometry of the parts for a structure such as a large tractor, the material type for each part and the associated in-service loads, we propose the following strategy:  Mesh all parts automatically. Then the user applies in-service loads and constraints. Then with constraints between adjacent parts applied automatically perform a linear static (or dynamic) 3D FEM analysis.   Also potential weld paths are identified automatically by adjacency between parts.  From the constraint force per unit length along each potential weld path, a trial weld size and weld procedure will be computed.  Next the structure is remeshed to include the proposed weld joints with filler metal.  Then a thermal stress analysis of the weld joints in the welded structure is done to compute the transient temperatures, microstructure evolution, residual stress and distortion due to welding.  The weld pool size and shape will be computed using an Ohji-Sudnik weld pool model. Microstructure evolution will be modelled using Monte Carlo algorithms and computational thermodynamics. The stress analysis will include single crystal thermo-visco-plastic analysis of the evolving microstructure.  Then either a linear or a non-linear plastic FEM analysis with constraints is redone with the new weld joints.  In these weld joints, the 3D stress distribution due to in-service loads and residual stress in the weld joints and particularly in high risk features such as the weld toe are computed.  From the stress distribution and in-service load cycles, the fatigue life of the weld is estimated. If the fatigue life is too long, the weld size can be reduced. If the fatigue life is too short, the weld must be strengthened or redesigned. This process will be done automatically.

"Despite decades of research in security systems, the state of computer security and privacy protection today is dismal. Millions of people continue to fall victim to phishing attacks, have their computers hijacked for use in botnets, and leave wide trails of personal information, ripe for the picking by identity thieves.



This research aims to provide secure and private access to Internet services, following four important principles; technologies that incorporate these principles are referred to as Useful Security and Privacy technologies. One of the most important principles is usability. In addition to ""ease-of-use"", we must consider the user's experience: if a technology improves security, but severely degrades performance, users will avoid it. Along with usability is deployability: systems must be easy to use, but also reasonable to use. For example, requiring end users to dramatically change how they do things makes the results of research meant to help them less relevant. Effectiveness and robustness are two other important principles of Useful Security and Privacy. Many security systems contain major flaws that greatly compromise their efficacy; it is important that these flaws are discovered and publicized in order to minimize their damage. Additionally, many systems are designed to work as advertised, as long as things go ""according to plan"". Reality is more brittle: users forget their passwords, their computers are vulnerable to malware, they misunderstand security-relevant messages, they fall victim to phishing attacks, etc. Useful systems must maintain as much security as possible in the face of problems like these. This robustness principle is one that most security technologies today overlook; we hope to make significant advances in the design of systems that can withstand various security failures.



In this project, we will look at the design of security and privacy systems and make them more useful through the application of these four principles, drawing on modern computer system design techniques.

Schrodinger equation plays in this mechanics the same role as the Newton equations of classical mechanics. In 1958 Anderson had discovered some very special characteristics of the dynamics of an electron propagating in a metal with considerable number of impurities. This fundamental discovery in the field of condensed matter physics suggested a number of very deep and hard mathematical problems. These problems were studied extensively in last fifty years. However the hardest and most important problems in this field remain unsolved. In the effort to solve these problems mathematicians have introduced new technologies which proved to be effective in various domains of modern mathematics.

"The project objective is to develop power-electronic couplings to harness energy from run-of-river kinetic turbines for supplying electric loads in remote areas. An instrumented on-site test platform will be constructed with an immersible turbine and Power Electronics Building Block (PEBB) based converter to feed the energy to the remote electrical grid. The facility will conduct research into the PEBB topology and control methods for providing high efficiency power with high quality. The facility will also be used to validate simulation models of such equipment, particularly to investigate possible undesirable interactions between grid and the turbine. The effects of ice formation and turbulence on the river turbine will be investigated. Presently many northern Canadian communities, such as aboriginal reserves, are supplied by expensive, polluting diesel generator sets, for which the fuel has to be transported via winter roads. The research will lead to the development of a relatively inexpensive clean renewable energy supply for such areas in Canada. It will also lead to the development of Highly Qualified Personnel who can be employed in the electrical manufacturing sector in Canada.

A Simulator is a  computer on which a large network can be modeled and studied, without the danger of catastrophic harm. This project proposes to place the simulator under the control of an optimization algorithm for selecting the parameters for the network that result in the best performance. A sequence of several runs is conducted, with the optimization algorithm inspecting the results of each simulation run and adjusting the design parameters using  advanced  mathematical procedures so that the subsequent  runs show improvement. When the sequence of runs is concluded, the system  is optimized. With this approach, the performance of today's complex power systems can be significantly improved using an automatic process. 



 The research also extends the theoretical approach to the practical problem of  globalized tuning of several controllers  which control the various pieces of network equipment. Without such tuning it is possible that different controllers in the network may adversely interfere with each other.   



The significant outcomes of this research will be tools that permit the design of well-behaved power networks which have a much reduced chance of suffering equipment damage or loss of stability that could result in a system-wide blackout such as the Eastern North American blackout of  August 2003. This is important for Canada where electric power is a critical resource. Additionally, Canada is a world leader in Power System Simulator Technology.

"Research in my laboratory is focused on elucidating and understanding the biological function of genes involved with bacterial defense mechanism against stress caused to cell-wall peptidoglycan by antimicrobial agents. These agents have become in-effective in the face of ever increasing number of resistant bacterial strains in hospital settings and community.  My laboratory is using the information from the genome-based research to elucidate the signaling pathways that are activated upon the inhibition of the bacterial cell wall. This knowledge will be of a great importance in understanding how bacteria evolve in the presence of environmental threats and how these mechanisms are further used for survival in the presence of antibacterial agents.  The goals of my research program are: 1) elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that underline the Staphyloccocus aureus response to antimicrobial agents that inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis; and  2) Identification of the signal(s) elicited upon cell-wall damage.  At the moment we have demonstrated that a two-component signal transduction is responsible for the regulation of a little known protein that we have shown to interact with peptidoglycan and beta-lactam antibiotics. We are in the process on unraveling the function of other genes closely related with the bacterial response to cell-wall-active antibiotics. The proposed program constitutes a basic research on gene function and gene regulation in S. aureus that is of great interest to the research community involved with the ever increasing issue of antibiotic resistance.

At a fraction of the commercial system cost, the new experimental facility will enable SFU researchers to continue or initiate their respective research in the key areas of vehicle stability, ride and handling; vehicle wheel diagnostic and condition monitoring; and alternative energy generation through energy harvesting techniques to name a few.

"The overall goal of our research program is to achieve a better understanding of the cellular process of protein synthesis or translation. Translation is an absolute requirement for the survival of a cell and as a final step of gene expression, translation control is used to regulate the expression of a variety of mRNAs under different important physiological conditions such as embryonic development and cancer. Translation is also the target site of many anti-microbial drugs. During the next five years, we propose to investigate translation using a large-scale genetic interaction analysis in the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The information gathered from these analyses will significantly impact our current understanding of the protein complexes and pathways involved in translation. We also expect to identify numerous novel translation genes that will set path for a number of follow-up projects. In addition, we plan to investigate the molecular activity of two novel translation gene products, Ski2 and Tae1. We have previously proposed that both these proteins are involved in the biogenesis of translation machinery. By studying the details of translation, we both gain a better understanding of the unifying principles of the cellular process of protein synthesis in nature, and derive novel strategies that could be used in medical applications, such as the development of novel strategies for cancer therapy and advancement of new and improved anti-microbial drugs.

"Process intensification and implementation of green technologies such as membrane separation techniques offer very promising approach to meet the challenges stemming from rapid development in consumer demand and constraints from public concern over environment and safety. Unfortunately most of these technologies are limited by low transfer rates caused by concentration polarization, surface fouling and low molecular diffusion. Use of oscillatory motion has proven effective in increasing transfer rates in many applications such as gas-liquid, liquid-liquid, and solid-liquid systems. It can also be used for enhancing performance of applications limited by molecular diffusion such as supported liquid membranes which are emerging as promising alternative to conventional liquid extraction. This however still requires more investigation to determine the effect of oscillation on flow patterns and transfer mechanisms involved and its contribution to the overall enhancement. Another technique that can potentially be applied for augmenting transfer rates is the use of nanofluids. The approach has proven effective in improving thermal conductivities and could therefore affect mass transport in a similar way. Combining this with oscillatory motion could offer an attractive option for enhancing the performance of applications limited by molecular diffusion and/or low interfacial transfer rate. Unfortunately, no information is available on the use of nanofluids for mass transfer or dispersion enhancement. The main objective of this research program is address the above issues, and to gain the required knowledge to enable the effective use of oscillatory motion  and nanofluids for mass transfer and dispersion enhancement. A second objective of this research program is to investigate the potential of achieving optimum oscillatory conditions using passive means such as self-sustained oscillation as an alternative to forced oscillation which adds to the complexity and energy consumption of the process.

"I propose to do research in the areas of Sequential Statistical Algorithms and Change-Point Analysis.



1. Sequential Testing is necessary when observations come in one by one over a period of time. Monitoring is ongoing to detect change in the data generating mechanism, such as change in climate, manufacturing quality, etc. In my earlier work new type of algorithms have been defined for the independent observations case. These are superior to existing methods as, although optimal for minimizing the reaction time after change had occurred, those have unacceptable type I error. This is the reason why many sequential testing methods remained mostly in the theoretical domain, and practitioners have not adapted them widely. The new algorithms have tight control over type I errors, easy to perform, and pay for this with only slightly increased delay time in raising alarm (declaring that the data generating mechanism has changed). Having solved this problem for independent observations other data structures have to be considered as the independence assumptions are often violated in practice. Work is ongoing and expanding for different time series observations that are arising in practice.  Data structures that arise in clinical trials are of special interest. The implementation of sequential monitoring for them is based on solving theoretically challenging problems.



2. Change-Point Detection: In these algorithms we look at the data retrospectively to see if any disturbance has occurred. Such methods are essential, as if there was a structural change in the data generating procedure, and it was not detected, then all model fitting and forecast are erroneous. Potential and existing applications of these methods are in environmental data analysis, econometrics, biostatistics, etc.

"One of the fundamental paradigms that have emerged from the study of black holes and quantum

gravity is the Holographic Principle. This principle expresses the idea that the complete description of

a gravitational system in a region of spacetime can be formulated in terms of a non-gravitational theory living on the boundary of that region. This remarkable connection allows us to reformulate fundamental questions in quantum gravity such as what happens at the big bang, what happens near a black hole singularity, ... purely in terms of boundary degrees of freedom whose interactions are captured by a non-gravitational field theory. It also allows us to study the physics of strongly coupled non-gravitational systems using gravity.



String theory/M-theory is the leading candidate for a theory of quantum gravity and aims to unify the

fundamental forces of particle physics with gravity. The theory provides a consistent theory for quantum gravity in the perturbative regime. This has led to a wealth of insights about the structure of spacetime and matter at short distances but falls short of giving a fully satisfactory answer to the deepest riddles in quantum gravity.



In this research program we aim to give a holographic formulation of string theory and M-theory with specific

boundary conditions, with the goal of being able to formulate quantum gravitational questions in terms of a

non-gravitational theory living on the theory. We also aim to shed light on the important, yet unresolved

problem of what is M-theory? Using holographic techniques we propose to tackle this fundamental question,

with the goal of identifying the microscopic degrees of freedom of M-theory as well as finding the physical

formulation of the still mysterious membranes and fivebranes of M-theory, and the role they play in quantum

"Infectious bursal disease (IBD) is an acute and highly contagious infectious disease of immature chickens caused by a virus that belongs to the family Birnaviridae.  It is characterized by destruction of lymphocytes in the bursa of Fabricius (BF) which damages the immune system and cause immunosuppression. The disease is a major problem in poultry production areas throughout the world. Because the IBD virus is resistant to many disinfectants and environmental factors, once a poultry house becomes contaminated, the disease tends to recur in subsequent flocks. An effective IBD prevention and control program typically involves a broiler breeder parent vaccination program, an effective barn cleaning and disinfection program, and in many areas, a broiler vaccination program. Immunization of breeders is an important part of the IBD control program. Antibodies produced by the hen are passed through the egg to the broiler chick. These maternal antibodies, if present in adequate levels, can protect young chicks against infection with many field IBDVs. Control of IBD has been complicated by the recognition of ""variant"" strains of the IBD virus in significant number of broiler barns in Saskatchewan. ""Variant"" viruses damage BF, even in chicks from well vaccinated hens. ""Variant"" strains do not cause obvious clinical disease, but can induce severe immunosuppression. Variant IBDVs are not a different serotype of IBD, but they are antigenically different to cause immunosuppresion even in broilers from well vaccinated breeders. IBDV vaccines used in Canada are based on the USA IBDV strains and their effectiveness against Canadian IBDV field strains has not been investigated. Thus, the proposed studies are aimed at to identify proper vaccination programs in broilers and their parent flocks to control IBD and to reduce immunosuppresion and associated secondary diseases. Preventing secondary bacterial diseases associated with immunosuppression will lead to minimize antibiotic use and emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria.","Animal management (animal diseases, breeding)","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"
"The use of antibiotics by the animal industry has been linked to increasing the risk of developing resistant strains of bacteria. Preventing the likelihood of drug residues in meat products is also important, both for domestic and international trade. For these reasons, the animal production industry is seeking to reduce the use of therapeutic agents by developing non therapeutic strategies for disease control such as effective vaccine use. In recent years inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) in broilers has emerged as an economically important disease in Canada. Certain serotypes and genotypes of fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs) from the genus Aviadenovirus within the family Adenoviridae have been associated with IBH outbreaks. Transmission of adenoviruses occur both horizontally and vertically. Horizontal transmission occurs from one infected bird to another naive bird. Vertical transmission occurs by transmitting adenovrus through eggs to their progeny from infected parent flocks.



A preliminary study conducted in Saskatchewan concluded that outbreaks of IBH in broilers are likely due to vertical transmission of adenovirus. Based on the results of this study it would be prudent to develop a vaccine against adenoviruses to control IBH in broilers by vaccinating their parent flocks. Vaccination of broiler parent flocks against viral diseases in the broiler industry is in common practice. Thus, the proposed studies are aimed at elucidating the mechanisms through which adenovirus vaccines control IBH and develop an effective vaccine for use by the broiler industry. Findings of the proposed studies are expected to facilitate the establishment and maintenance of animal health and prevention of diseases.

"The first part of this program considers bootstrap methods for panel data regression models estimated with fixed effects. In particular, I develop a new bootstrap method for panel regression models that is robust to serial and cross sectional dependence of unknown form in the error term. I call it the panel block bootstrap method because it resamples blocks of the vector that collects the cross section units for each time period. It is the bootstrap analogue of the Driskoll and Kraay (1998) covariance estimator for spatial and serial dependent panel data models. Preliminary simulations show that the panel block bootstrap has good finite sample properties and dominates the Driskoll and Kraay (1998) robust standard errors. I prove the first order asymptotic validity of the panel block bootstrap method under conditions similar to those used by Driskoll and Kraay (1998). Then I investigate to what extent the panel block bootstrap can outperform the asymptotic theory of Driskoll and Kraay (1998).

The second part of this research program considers bootstrap methods of inference on large factor models. Factor models are a useful dimension reduction device because they can summarize the information contained in a large number of variables. The estimated factors are often used subsequently in a regression or a forecasting model.

The main goal is to develop bootstrap methods for regression models that rely on estimated factors. As Bai and Ng (2006) show, two sources of estimation uncertainty arise: one is due to the estimation of the parameters in the regression model and the other is due to estimation of the factors. I intend to propose a bootstrap method that captures both forms of estimation uncertainty.

"The objective of this proposal is to develop the fundamental science and engineering of semiconductor materials and their interfaces with the oxide thin film structures. We need to develop the conceptual set of tools, chemical and physical characterization methods and engineering strategies that can be exploited to understand and design novel materials and interfaces that will undoubtedly grow in importance for nanoelectronic and optoelectronic applications.



Several issues will be addressed in this program:



- Growth of novel semiconductor materials for high-mobility electronic and optoelectronic applications;

- Dopants distribution and their interaction with the defects in these semiconductor materials;

- Understanding of fundamental diffusion and reaction processes at surfaces and interfaces;

- Determination of chemical and thermal stability of functional semiconductor/oxide structures.



Our approach will be based on high-resolution experimental tools to attack these central problems in interface science: Rutherford backscattering (RBS), medium energy ion scattering (MEIS), Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and electrical analysis. Materials exploration will begin with Si, SiGe, SiCAlN alloys as semiconductors, and strontium titanate and yttrium stabilized zirconia as dielectrics.

"Over the last four decades, the development of image segmentation algorithms has been an area of considerable research activity. The reason for such significant attention to this problem lies in its practical importance. Image segmentation is a key step towards high-level tasks such as image understanding and serves in a wide range of applications including object recognition, scene analysis or content-based image/video retrieval. 



Many image segmentation algorithms have been elaborated. However, strong segmentation, which corresponds to a partitioning of an image's pixels into regions that are semantically meaningful to people, remains a difficult and as yet largely unsolved problem. Most image segmentation algorithms extract regions satisfying some uniformity (homogeneity) criterion, which is based on low-level data-driven visual features (e.g., color, texture). Unfortunately, homogeneous regions do not necessarily (and usually do not) correspond to semantically meaningful objects. This is mainly caused by the disconnection between low-level visual features and high-level semantics, which is commonly referred to as the semantic gap. This has motivated researchers to develop image segmentation methods that, by introducing high-level knowledge into the segmentation process, can break through the performance ceiling imposed by the semantic gap. The main disadvantage of those methods is their lack of flexibility due to the assumption that such knowledge is provided in advance, which heavily restricts the application domain.



The main objective of the proposed research is to develop image segmentation strategies which, through the use of machine learning, generate and incorporate high-level knowledge into the segmentation process.","Computer software","Computing and Information Sciences - B"

"Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a technology for the automated identification of physical entities using radio frequency transmissions.  RFID systems have gained popularity in many applications, such as supply chain management, library systems, e-passports, contactless cards (e.g., proximity cards, automated toll-payment transponders, and payment tokens), identification systems, and human implantation (such as medical-record indexing, and physical access control).  Future applications could include smart appliances, shopping, and medication compliance monitoring.  RFID is one of the most promising technologies in the field of ubiquitous and pervasive computing.  Many new applications can be created by embedding an object with RFID tags. However, the rapid development of RFID systems raises serious privacy and security concerns that could prevent the benefits of RFID technology from being fully utilized.  The concerns about RFID systems arise from a) privacy concerns of users about clandestine physical tracking and inventorying of tags; b) authentication problems from counterfeit or cloned tags; and c) communication attacks of jamming, traffic analysis, spoofing, eavesdropping, relay or man-in-the-middle attacks, denial of service attacks, and side-channel attack.  Overcoming these concerns will be a significant challenge, because RFID tags do not have sufficient computational power and memory capacity to support standard cryptographic primitives. The proposed research  will develop new mechanisms for privacy protection, authentication, and key-distribution for low-cost  RFID systems through combinations of physical layer  assisted privacy protection, ultra-light crypto engine based core security functions, and private identification security protocols.

"Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a technology for automated identification of physical entities using radio frequency transmissions. Typically, RFID systems consist of simple, low-cost tags (transponders) that are attached to physical objects and more powerful readers (interrogators) that queue data stored in tags. In the past ten years, RFID systems gain popularity in many applications, such as supply chain management, library system, e-passport, contactless cards,  identification systems, and human implantation (such as  medical-record indexing, and physical access control).  Future applications could include smart appliances, shopping, and medication compliance.

 

RFID privacy concerns the problem of misbehaving readers harvesting information from well-behaving tags. RFID authentication, on the other hand, concerns the problem of well-behaving readers harvesting information from misbehaving tags, particularly counterfeit ones. The challenge for securing RFID systems is lack of adequate computational resources within the tag as well as key distributions among supply chain management systems. Usually, only up to few thousand gates can be devoted to security functions. The purpose of the proposed research is  to investigate a new paradigm for privacy protection and authentication mechanisms  for low cost RFID systems by combinations of signal design/detection at radio transmission layers, ultra-light crypto engine and security protocols.

Imagine that you are sitting in your living room watching a live NHL game. You have a giant screen and a surround sound system, which make you feel as if you are rink-side. In some aspects, it may be better than watching rink-side -- you have the freedom to pause the game when you go for a drink and resume when you return, which is possible because newer television systems can locally store the signals and play them when you want. However, don't you also want to have the freedom to control your viewpoint so that you can watch the game from your favorite spot, or even freeze the action when someone scores and replay the scene from different perspectives? The proposed research program aims at making this a reality for the next generation of television systems.



The objective of this research is to develop efficient methods that can capture the appearances of dynamic real scenes and present them interactively in 3D to local or remote viewers. The problem of dynamic scene modeling and rendering will be investigated from both image analysis and image synthesis points of view. On the analysis side, we will study how to efficiently and accurately estimate 3D locations and motions of objects in the scene. On the synthesis side, we will explore an efficient way to synthesize physically correct novel views based on sparsely sampled videos and the 3D information estimated. To achieve real-time performance, both image analysis and image synthesis algorithms will be designed and optimized for parallel execution on programmable graphics hardware. Our preliminary research in this area has yielded very promising results.

"With an annual production ranging from 3 to 3.7 million tonnes, field peas constitute a major source of income for farmers in Western Canada. They also constitute an excellent feed ingredient for swine. However, they still have the reputation of an ingredient with bad taste that negatively affects feed intake. A recent survey among Canadian feed producers has shown that palatability is the main reason why they limit peas in rations for swine. There is thus potential for using considerably more Canadian peas in animal nutrition but it is necessary to clarify if pea taste is a problem or not since, despite the feed producer's concerns, it has never been demonstrated. 

Dutch scientists have recently suggested that SAPONINS might be the actual responsible for the problem of taste. Saponins are non-volatile substances that occur in legume seeds such as peas, soybeans or lentils. Different types can be distinguished but peas contain predominantly the B and B-DDMP saponin forms. It is the latter that brings the bitter taste.

No information is available on the concentrations of saponins in Canadian pea varieties. The possible effect on pig behaviour has not been demonstrated either.

This project aims to generate original information on the presence of saponins in Canadian pea varieties and on the possible consequences of that presence for the animal feed industry. The method used for soybean will be adapted to peas and the main Canadian pea varieties will be analysed for their saponin content. Different experiments will then be carried out on pigs in order to evaluate the effect of pea intake on feed intake and pig growth. The effect of pea processing (pelleting and extrusion) as well as the interactions with other feed ingredients such as canola meal will also be evaluated. The results will be of great importance for the feed and food industries, the pulse producers and the plant breeders.

"The stress associated with marketing pigs may result in reduced meat quality, some mortality, and a challenge to the pigs' welfare.  This proposal addresses factors that contribute to the stressfulness of handling and transportation associated with the marketing of pigs.  These factors include components of the loading process, such as facility design, design of the transport vehicle including characteristics of each compartment, and the degree to which animals recover from stress both on the vehicle and at the slaughter plant.  The project involves three phases: the first to identify causes of stress under commercial transport conditions; the second to more closely examine these components and means to reduce their stressfulness in intensive controlled studies; and the third to incorporate changes under commercial conditions to assess their effectiveness in reducing stress and improving meat quality.  Portions of the project will be conducted in both western and eastern Canada, during both summer and winter, in order to include regional differences in climate and management.  The project is multi-disciplinary in design involving animal behaviour, physiology, engineering, and meat quality.  It represents a collaboration of scientists from four Canadian universities and affiliated research labs. The project is supported by both pig producer organizations and meat processors.

"The problem of predicting just how ecosystems will respond to large-scale modifications of the environment, such as habitat destruction and climate change, is the major challenge facing environmental science today. For example, we only poorly understand how biodiversity will adapt and change in response to environmental stressors, and what the ecosystem consequences of changing biodiversity will be. 

How habitat destruction and climate change will interact to cause biodiversity change is also poorly known. The general objective of my research is to combine theory and experiment to develop a scientific framework that can be used to predict and mitigate the impacts of environmental change on ecological systems. For example, we are using experiments to study the combined impacts of habitat destruction and climate change on a feathermoss (Pleurozium schreberi) ecosystem common throughtout the boreal biome. The feathermoss fixes atmospheric nitrogen due to a mutualistic relationship with a diverse array of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria that form part of a more complex food web dominated by microarthropods. We are using a field experiment to study how these two major components of environmental change affect the distribution and abundance of microarthropod diversity that inhabit the moss, and 2) cause microarthropod species loss which may compromise ecosystem functioning and stability. We are particularly interested in impacts on the nitrogen cycle, and how habitat fragmentation and climate change will disturb cyanobacterial N2 fixing activity, both directly through change in temperature and humidity, and indirectly through changes in the microarthropod food web. Data collected from field experiments of this type will form an essential part of the strategies that will be implemented to mitigate the impacts of ongoing environmental change in the subarctic.

"Images on computer screens or on paper are a large part of our everyday lives.  Although the number of images we have access to is growing exponentially, the efficiency, beauty, and distillation of the information we see is not improving at the same rate.  In my research, I address how  to create or extend the communication power of images by mapping visible changes from one domain to another.  There is a precarious mapping between how a scene would be perceived and how an image is perceived. For example, although the human visual system does not have a strong absolute sense of color or intensity,  images are stored as a discrete set of color or intensity values at each pixel.  The goal of this research is to create perceptually salient images by more directly expressing perceived differences in scenes as displayed differences in images.  Perceptual difference preservation is useful for may image generation tasks including automatically creating technical illustrations from 3D models, creating a color to grayscale conversion algorithm that preserves all visible color changes through high-dimensional distance metrics, and for hidden feature finding techniques that identify correspondences and mismatches between X-ray and visible light images of historically significant paintings through segmentation and local gradient statistics.

"Detecting manipulated images has become an important problem in many domains (including medical imaging, journalism and scientific publication) largely due to the recent success of image synthesis techniques and the accessibility of image editing software. Many previous signal-processing techniques are concerned with finding forgery through simple transformation (e.g. resizing, rotating, or scaling), yet little attention is given to examining the semantic content of an image, which is the main issue in recent image forgeries. Professor Gooch proposes to find anomalies within digital images by combining methods from computer graphics and artificial intelligence. First, perceptually meaningful regions will be computed using image segmentation techniques. Second, the regions will be classified based on image statistics. Third, AI common sense reasoning techniques will be used to find ambiguities and anomalies within an image as well as perform reasoning across a corpus of images to identify a semantically based candidate list of potential fraudulent images. The proposed method introduces a novel framework for forensic reasoning, which will allow detection of image tampering.","Information and communication services","Commun.,Computers & Components"

"My research is in nonassociative ring theory and loop theory. A ""ring"" is a set of elements, like the integers, which you can add and multiply.  Unlike the integers, however, I don't always assume that multiplication is associative: thus (ab)c=a(bc) need not always be the case.  A long-standing project of mine has to been to find all small rings of various types.  An important class of rings which are not (necessarily) associative is the class of ""alternative"" rings, these being rings in which (ab)c=a(bc) is not generally true though it is true if two of the three symbols are the same.  Some years ago, a PhD student and I found all the alternative ""algebras"" of low prime power orders, work I want to continue and for other kinds of rings as well.



A ""loop"" has just one operation.  Again, I don't assume associativity, although I have become interested in certain loops that are ""nearly associative"" in the sense that all their proper subloops are associative.  Together with a colleague in Philadelphia, some preliminary results have been obtained in special cases. 



There is an object called a ""loop ring"" whose elements look like polynomials, a+bx+cx^2+ ..., but where the powers of x are replaced by elements from a loop. When multiplication in the loop is associative, the resulting ""group ring"" has been studied a lot.  Much of my research involves attempts to push known results from group rings to more general loop rings and to find features unique to this situation.  The continuation of this work is part of this proposal as it is the search for loops whose loop rings satisfy various identities. 



My work is well known and has brought Canada and the name of Memorial University to the attention of people in Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Brazil, for example.  As well, quite a bit of my research is accessible even to undergraduate students whom I hope to continue to attract to mathematical research.

"This is a request for equipment that permits researchers to create temporary 'virtual' lesions in specific brain regions of volunteers while those volunteers are performing behavioural tasks.  The technique is called transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS for short.  By temporarily interfering with the function of a particular brain region, TMS allows researchers to determine the function of brain circuits in that region.  When used properly, TMS poses no significant risk to humans.



Researchers at the Centre for Brain and Mind at the University of Western Ontario will use TMS in conjunction with brain imaging (functional MRI or fMRI) to answer a number of central questions in cognitive neuroscience.  How does our brain convert sensory information about the world into skilled goal-directed actions?  How does our brain decode speech signals into meaningful communication?  How do our emotions affect our performance on demanding tasks - and what brain areas are involved in this regulation?  How does our brain enable us to recognize and remember people?  How does our brain make sense of all the different kinds of objects and events we encounter every day? In other words, how do we learn to sort things into meaningful categories?   In addition, physicists working closely with researchers in the Centre are striving to improve TMS - and make it compatible with the brain scanners that researchers use to study the activity of the brain.

"The human hand is a remarkable piece of engineering.  We humans can reach out and grasp objects with exquisite accuracy - far better than any robot.  One of the things that make this possible is our keen sense of sight.  Dr. Mel Goodale and his colleagues at the Vision and Motor Control Laboratory at the University of Western Ontario are studying the different kinds of information that our visual system uses to guide the hand as it reaches out and grasps an object.  To study how the hand is moving, Dr. Goodale uses special infra-red sensitive cameras to track tiny infra-red emitters that have been attached to the fingertips, hand, and wrist.  The data from these cameras can then be used to reconstruct the trajectory of the hand and fingers as the grasping movement unfolds.  Previous work in Dr. Goodale's lab has shown that information from the two eyes - binocular vision - play an important role in the guidance of these movements.  But there are other sources of information as well, including the motion of the world on our eyes as we move around and a whole host of cues called 'pictorial cues to depth'.  These latter cues - perspective, familiar size, occlusion, shadows, and texture gradients - have been exploited by artists for centuries to depict a three-dimensional world on a two-dimensional canvas.  Dr. Goodale and his team are exploring the role of all these different cues in the planning and control of grasping movements of the hand - and whether or not these cues, particularly binocular vision and motion, are more easily used in the lower part of our visual field where our hand is usually moving when it reaches out to grasp something.  He is also looking at how we cope with visual illusions - and has already shown that illusions that deceive our eyes rarely fool our grasping hand!   Recently, Dr. Goodale has begun to use brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI) to explore which parts of the brain are involved in eye-hand coordination.  This work is not only providing basic information about how vision is used to control the human hand but is also helping in the design of better systems for controlling robot hands.  It is not the first time that biology has provided engineering with some useful lesions in design.

"Researchers in neurophysiology, psychology, and computer science at the University of Western Ontario, York University, and Queen's University are teaming up to train the next generation of brain scientists.  Led by Dr. Mel Goodale, Director of the Centre for Brain and Mind at Western, the team hopes to bridge the gaps between brain research, robotics, and medicine.  The emphasis will be on how information from our senses is used to control skilled movements.  Although work on artificial intelligence has made great strides and there are now computers that can beat the best chess players in the world, even the most advanced robots lack the dexterity of even a six-year old child when it comes to picking up and moving a chess piece on the board.  By studying how the human brain selects and controls such movements, the team hopes to uncover principles that can be used to design better robots - and at the same time, gain insights into what goes wrong in individuals who have suffered a stroke or some other kind of brain damage or disease.  Students and young researchers from a wide range of backgrounds, including engineering, mathematics, computer science, physiology, and psychology, will be recruited into this new interdisciplinary training program.  Working closely with researchers in all three universities, the trainees will learn to construct mathematical models of how the brain selects and controls motor action, and to design and carry out experiments to test these models using brain imaging and other state-of-the-art techniques.  The mathematical models (and the biological principles they describe) will lead to the development of novel engineering applications in everything from prosthetic devices for patients to interactive video displays and robots working in the operating room and automated assembly lines. It is hoped that this new training program will promote the successful transfer of basic research on the brain into the clinic and other settings where it can make a tangible contribution to the health and well-being of Canadians.

"Over 100 families of flowering plants are estimated to have genetically controlled self-incompatibility (SI) systems. The presence of SI prevents a fertile hermaphroditic plant from self-fertilizing thereby preventing the deleterious effects of inbreeding. SI systems represent an impressive molecular cross-talk between male and female reproductive tissues. Individuals typically contain two tightly linked, highly variable genes at the S-locus; one of these is expressed in the male (pollen grain or pollen tube) and the other in the female (stigma or pistil) reproductive cells. During reproduction, male and female gene products interact and when their S-proteins match fertilization is prevented.  My work addresses three main areas of SI research. Firstly, I have an on-going project to use classical and molecular approaches to determine the genetic basis of SI in the bellflower genus Campanula (Campanulaceae). We have recently identified candidate proteins for the female determinant of SI in C. rapunculoides and propose to continue the protein analyses and employ new molecular and experimental methods in our search. Secondly, I am interested in the effect of population structure on SI. Because self-fertilization may be selected in small or isolated populations, I propose experiments to study the role of population fragmentation on SI, fitness and connectivity among populations. Lastly, I use a variety of statistical methods to study the gain and loss of SI at the macro-phylogenetic level. In particular, I am interested in studying whether self-incompatible lineages have higher net diversification rates than self-compatible lineages. This project contributes fundamental knowledge to our understanding of the factors driving speciation and the incredible diversity of angiosperms over geological time: something Darwin referred to as ""the abominable mystery"". My overall research program contributes knowledge to basic research in pollen-pistil interactions and evolutionary genetics. It also contributes to applications in conservation biology examining the effect of fragmentation on plant reproduction and to applications in agriculture concerned with breeding programs for self-incompatible crops such as pear, cherries and apple.

"In this project, we will develop a new time/frequency analysis technique for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that is interactive and operates in real time, in order to detect brain regions that are communicating while subjects are at rest.

Although fMRI has emerged as a valuable tool to investigate brain function, results are dependent on the task the subject is asked to perform and the subject's behaviour during the task. This may be of major concern when investigating the effects of neurological disease or age on brain function. As a result, there is increasing interest in understanding brain activity during rest (that is, in the absence of a task or stimulus). It has been demonstrated that fluctuations of the resting-state fMRI signal over time are highly correlated between brain regions consistent with our current understanding of anatomical connections. 

    )	The major concern for resting-state studies is reliably keeping the subject in a state of rest for the duration of the imaging session. If the resting state is disrupted even for a moment, such as during a brief movement or an active thought process, the estimate of the contribution of brain regions to the resting state may not be accurate. We propose that a time-frequency analysis of fMRI signals will successfully determine the signal components responsible for the resting-state, by detecting and removing temporally resolved frequency components responsible for the disruption of the resting state. As a result, our proposal has two main objectives. First, we will demonstrate that brief movements and active thought processes introduce frequency components into the fMRI signal that are detectable by the Stockwell transform. Second, we will develop and implement an interactive and real-time console that generates images of brain regions that are communicating during the resting-state, as a means to advance our technology towards improving healthcare and in the study of how changes in functional connections facilitate the learning of new skills.

"This research program focuses on the theoretical foundations and engineering principles for the design of high-confidence real-time systems. 



Real-time systems execute many tasks concurrently and need to respond to events within expected deadlines. This requirement calls for careful resource allocation and task sequencing. The increased use of embedded computing and greater interaction with the physical world has led to more systems becoming ``real-time.'' Moreover, even services offered over networks are expected to deliver results on time because of service-level agreements between service providers and clients. There is, however, a lot of dynamic behavior -- because of complexities in system architecture and because of varying workload -- that limits the use of traditional deterministic analysis. This research program will develop a mathematical basis for reasoning about predictable behavior (mainly temporal behavior) when workload can fluctuate and when allocations along multiple resource dimensions -- not just CPU share -- affect response times. Theoretical analysis will be backed up with the implementation of mechanisms for ensuring that resource allocations can be made with fine granularity and accuracy. These mechanisms will be developed at the operating system level and below to provide system architects and developers with the primitives for building robust real-time systems. The combination of theoretical tools and engineering principles can drive down the cost of system building, which is currently extremely high because of resource over-provisioning, extensive debugging and re-engineering and certification costs. The lowering of costs will lead to greater market penetration for pervasive computing applications that integrate computation, communication and control and provides a significant opportunity for Canada to take a lead role in the design and development of embedded systems and ubiquitous services.","Information and communication services","Computing and Information Sciences - A"

"While cardiovascular devices have significantly increased the life expectancy of millions of people, their use is not without complications.  Despite anticoagulant and anti-platelet therapies, blood clots (thrombus) continue to occur with cardiovascular devices such as stents and heart valves.  The consequences may be fatal and the cost to treat these thrombotic complications is significant.  While most research on thrombus formation has ignored the role of white blood cells (leukocytes), my own research has shown that they may have a significant impact.  Using in vitro experiments, whereby blood contacts materials used in mechanical heart valves and stents, this research will examine in more details the role that leukocytes play in thrombus formation in the presence of a material.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the interactions between the material, leukocytes and other components of blood such as platelets.  This is a holistic approach which will identify interactions that are often overlooked.  As a result, this will identify potential target for drug therapies and surface modifications that effectively reduce the incidence of thrombus formation with cardiovascular devices. 

This research will train four graduate students in the interdisciplinary methods of biomaterials engineering, preparing them to contribute to the emerging Canadian biotechnology industry.  Overall, this research will provide a greater understanding of blood-material interactions and help in the development of materials that are better accepted by the human body. Better materials will translate into fewer complications with the use of cardiovascular devices, hence improving the quality of life of patients and reducing re-hospitalization costs.

"Actuators, devices which make things move, play a critical role in applications from aerospace to medical, assembly to transportation.  A class of unique ""smart materials"" relies on molecular-level transformations within the material to create actuators capable of completely scalable motion with molecular-scale precision.  In addition, these actuators are lighter, smaller, and have fewer moving parts than their more traditional counterparts like motors or hydraulics.  This gives them significant appeal in space applications where volume, mass, and robustness are key features.  For example, the Canadian Space Agency is interested in my research on shape control to help enable lightweight ""unfoldable"" space antennas.

  Before these new materials can be successfully used in actuator applications, however, there must be a way to accurately control the transformations which take place within the material. Only in this way can we achieve the precision of which the actuators are theoretically capable. To design controllers for these actuators, one must model the material behaviour and apply a body of knowledge known as ""control theory"". My research is devoted to improving modelling of smart material behaviour, developing new mathematical theory and tools to analyze and design these exciting new actuators, and investigating applications which are of benefit to Canada and Canadians.

  My research on using responsive materials to compensate negative temperature effects in satellite communication equipment will allow the use of much cheaper and lighter materials in construction.  This in turn allows increased fuel payloads, adding years and millions of dollars of value to the life of a satellite.  In Cambridge Ontario, COMDEV, a world leader in satellite communications equipment, is well-positioned to take advantage of this technology.  The automotive industry is also keenly interested in the light-weighting potential of smart materials as well as the increased robustness they provide.  I am currently involved in research with General Motors on the design of smart-material based actuators for automotive applications.

Most water treatment plants in Canada disinfect water with chlorine before releasing it into the distribution pipelines. Natural organic matter in potable water sources reacts with chlorine forming trihalomethanes (THMs) byproducts, which have been linked to cancer, cardiac anomalies, and birth defects.  Many water treatment plants in Canada significantly exceed the drinking water guidelines of 100 ppb. Concentration of THMs can be reduced if organic carbon (TOC) is removed from the water by coagulation, flocculation and settling of flocs.  Flocculation can be significantly enhanced by the addition of chlorine dioxide. The use of chlorine dioxide has been very limited in North America and there is little information on the performance of chlorine dioxide on Canadian water.    

The successful settling of flocs reduces the concentration of TOC and the dose of disinfectant and its carcinogenic by-products. Many Canadian surface waters have relatively low turbidity and high TOC, and flocs formed in such waters settle poorly.  To improve floc settling we must identify the properties responsible for the settling problems.  Typically Stokes' Law is used to model settling and obtain information on floc properties such as density or drag acting on the floc but size, density, and porosity are difficult to describe due to extremely irregular floc structure.  Fractal geometry has proved to be a good method for characterizing these chaotic and complex structures.    In this research, the properties of coagulation flocs will be analyzed with a variety of analytical techniques. Fractal dimensions will then be used to model floc settling.  

This work will contribute to the reduction of carcinogenic chlorine disinfection by-products in Canadian potable water, thereby reducing health risks associated with our drinking water.

"While we understand the basic biology of inflammation, we have yet to generate a reasoned overview of how the individual components interact with each other. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there exists a much greater interdependence of these functions than previously appreciated. We have developed a new tool with which we can investigate these processes, an

anti-inflammatory drug, called G31P, that it very specifically blocks an entire class of inflammatory molecules (chemokines).  It is highly effective as an anti-inflammatory agent. In fact, it is much more effective than we would have predicted, so we wish to know exactly how it works in blocking the activities of other classes of inflammatory molecules, and how these different pathways intersect. We have some evidence that is also blocks processes not traditionally thought of as inflammatory (e.g., the spread of cancer cells in the body). We will use a combination of test tube and live animal studies to investigate the roles of these various systems (ie, the chemokine and non-chemokine pathways) in the body. Overall, these studies are designed allow us to gain a greater understanding of inflammatory processes such that we can better manage them clinically.

"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating disease affecting approximately three million, or 10% of Canadians.  Although many researchers have hypothesized a link between altered mechanical loading within the knee joint and osteoarthritis progression, no definitive formula for this connection has been made.  In addition, most people believe OA is a disease that affects articular cartilage alone, when in fact all tissues in the joint are modified by the disease.  The research outlined in this proposal will examine the changes to some of the lesser studies soft tissues of the knee joint such as the joint capsule and meniscus, for both altered structure and mechanical response to loading.  The tissue samples will be obtained from an animal model, to allow for a time controlled look at the disease progression, from the initial injury that leads to degenerative OA.  Samples will be analyzed through medical imaging techniques examining the entire knee joint, as well as state-of-the art small tissue sample biaxial testing.  Biochemical and histological analyses will also be conducted to quantify tissue constituents and organization.  This work may help to quantify a link between the mechanical degradation and tissue structural organization that occurs with OA.  Once we have an improved understanding of this relation, we will be in a better position to intervene earlier, and with improved treatment options for this disease affecting so many Canadians.

"Microscopes are commonplace in scientific labs as a means to observe and characterize samples. Usually, these microscopes come in two varieties: inverted and upright, depending upon the required application. For the purposes of illuminating and measuring the response of single isolated nanostructures, a combined inverted-upright microscope is required. This allows for measuring the transmission characteristics and reflection characteristics simultaneously.  

    While on sabbatical at the Institute of Photonic Sciences in Spain, Dr. Gordon collaborated in a project to optically trap 50 nm particles using a nanoscale hole in a metal film. That achievement is a fundamental improvement of orders of magnitude over trapping intensities used in past methods. It was an especially important feat for future biological applications, particularly involving viruses, since biological samples are sensitive to the local temperature. Such a trapping configuration required the use of a combined inverted-upright microscope, where the upright side is used to source the trapping laser beam and the inverted side is used to measure the light transmitted through the hole and thereby sense the absorption of the nanoparticle. The requested infrastructure will provide the dual-microscope capability to Dr. Gordon's own lab, unique to the region, with which Dr. Gordon can attempt new experiments on optical trapping of viruses and the study of isolated metal nanostructures. 

    Dr. Gordon has studied arrays of metal nanostructures for surface plasmon resonance sensing, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, surface enhanced fluorescence, quantum dot luminescence enhancements, nanoscale linear optics, nonlinear optical frequency conversion and optical trapping. With the proposed infrastructure, Dr. Gordon will be able to extend these studies to the transmission geometry for single isolated nanostructures, allowing for greater sensitivity and potentially, the ability to trap and isolate a virus and then to study its interaction with living cells.

"Extreme focusing of light down to the nanoscale can give orders of magnitude increase in the intensity. With this extreme focusing, many applications arise, such as identifying and isolating a single molecule, nonlinear optical switching with semiconductor lasers and studying relativistic laser-matter interactions. 

     Biosensors using early versions of this technology are being used in medical care, drug development and bio-hazard analysis. With extreme focusing, these biosensors will achieve unprecedented sensitivity, selectivity and isolation (through optical trapping) of the analyte. Metal nanostructures can provide the required extreme focusing, acting like optical antennae to squeeze light into a nanoscopic regions. The short wavelength of optics requires nanofabrication and the optical properties of the metal naturally keep light at the surface to help focusing. 

     The experimental and theoretical methods to achieve this extreme focusing are in place, and this research program will build on Dr. Gordon's past successes in this field to provide unprecedented focusing in nanostructured metals that will prove transformative to a number of applications in research, health care and industry.","Physical sciences","Condensed Matter Physics"

"The research proposed aims at the development of new and improved techniques for the analysis of organic compounds. The main thrust of the research will be the advancement of high efficiency and multidimensional separations, including comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC�GC) and liquid chromatography (LC�LC). In these techniques, components of the samples are subject to separation in two separate columns (""dimensions"") characterized by different properties. This vastly increases the chance that components that could not be separated in one column will be separated in the second one. In addition, the total number of components that can be separated in a single analysis is dramatically increased. The goals of the research include increasing the speed and efficiency of the separations through novel approaches. In GCxGC, we plan to continue the development of a novel thermal modulator (interface between the columns) which does not require any consumables. We will also explore incorporation of programmed temperature cooling to improve transfer of semi-volatile compounds to the second column. 

In HPLC, we will explore very high efficiency separations based on small particle columns. We will also develop mobile phase exchange schemes to overcome problems encountered today in LCxLC. In addition, novel universal detection schemes for HPLC will be studied aimed primarily at impurity characterization in the pharmaceutical industry. 

There is a growing need for inexpensive tools for the characterization of soil gas at polluted sites. PDMS-based permeation passive samplers developed by our group are suitable for this purpose. Specific aspects of soil gas sampling (e.g. low permeability of the soil) will be studied and taken into consideration when calibrating the samplers.

"I examine the definition, origin, and ubiquity of sex.  Perspectives change when fundamental assumptions are questioned.  Does self fertilization count as sex?  Why is genetic mixing considered the primary function of sex, despite the need to invoke group selection?  My goal is to write a definitive evolutionary history of sex.



My working hypothesis is that production of gametes and fertilization both rejuvenate an organism.  I posit that sex is not primarily a genetic phenomenon, but rather an epigenetic one.  More specifically, sex slows down evolution by resetting molecules responsible for development, resetting them to their state in previous generations.  This provides a direct benefit to the individual organism insofar as development would eventually go awry without production of gametes and fertilization.  This working hypothesis may explain the origin of sex and why sex still persists.  Compare this with the current and long-lived paradigm for the ubiquity of sex, in which sex increases genetic variation amongst all descendants, thereby speeding up evolution, but is not necessarily advantageous to any individual.



Our research entails devising theory, building mathematical models, and conducting empirical tests.  The theoretical work takes two tacks.  First, we try to explain why reset of developmental signals is associated with gamete formation and fertilization.  Why should this reset be inextricably tied to halving the number of chromosomes?  Second, we consider the term 'gene' to include signals that control development, even if these developmental signals may not be directly coded for by DNA.  We build mathematical models of how such generalized genes evolve, which we use to test whether presence of sex provides an advantage to populations and hence possibly explain why sex has persisted.  We empirically test whether reset of those molecular signals that regulate development are exclusively associated with meiosis and fertilization.

"Number fields are obtained when one wishes to define solutions to polynomial equations. They are the primary object of study of number theory. Abelian varieties are a generalization of elliptic curves and are one of the primary objects of study of algebraic geometry. The spaces that parameterize abelian varieties are a generalization of modular curves, called Shimura varieties. Shimura varieties play a central role in modern number theory. They are intimately related to Galois representations (projections of the absolute Galois group, whose study, arguably, is the chief purpose of algebraic number theory), explicit class field theory (that attempts to give an explicit handle on number fields), modular forms (examples of which are theta functions which encode the number of times a quadratic form represents an integer, and have many applications to physics and combinatorics), nonabelian harmonic analysis and more. 

Our proposal concerns several topics within this field. (i) Automorphic forms and the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence. A goal in this research is to construct via the geometry of Shimura varieties interesting expander graphs; such graphs have found many applications in theoretical computer science (complexity theory, sorting,...), technology (hash functions...) as well as striking applications to pure matematics. In this scope we also propose to study several issues in graph theory, in order to understand the possible variants arising in our approach. (ii) Complex multiplication and explicit class field theory. The goal is to extend our understanding, very limited at present in spite of more than a century of research, into the explicit construction of number fields via special values of modular forms. (iii) p-adic modular forms. Here our main project is to study certain maps between Shimura varieties that are central in the construction of the U operator, a linear operator acting on modular forms and central to the p-adic theory. (iv) Geometry of Shimura varieties of type SO(2, n). This special class of Shimura varieties has attracted increased attention ever since Borcherds Fields prize work. Their geometry is poorly understood at present, yet expected to yield a wealth of important results.

"The long-term goal of my research program is to define the regulation of gene expression in the halophilic archaea at the level of mRNA.  As an early branch of the evolutionary tree, the archaea hold a unique evolutionary status. Investigation of RNA metabolic pathways in archaea will therefore provide new insights into the evolution of these pathways, constrain models of the possible transition from RNA-only to RNA-protein molecular machinery, and ultimately allow us to form specific, testable conjectures about biochemical pathways in an RNA world. The immediate objective of this proposal is to investigate archaeal RNA turnover pathways by identification and characterization of ribonucleases and their specific RNA substrates. The identification and characterization of RNases through in vivo and in vitro studies, as well as determination of substrate mRNA secondary structures are key steps in determining the regulation of gene expression in the halophilic archaea at the level of mRNA.  Achieving the aims of this proposal will identify proteins involved in the pathways of RNA degradation, as well as identify the interactions and RNA substrates.  In addition, any specific secondary structure or specific sequences in the mRNA required for recognition by the degradative enzymes will be identified.  This knowledge will further the investigation of gene expression and regulation as controlled through post-transcriptional mechanisms, allow further refinement of RNA structure prediction algorithms, and allow comparison to the known pathways in other systems and further elucidate the evolutionary relationships between the kingdoms of bacteria, eukarya and archaea.","Advancement of knowledge","Cell Biology"

"A biological process called autophagy has recently garnered enormous attention due to its association with human diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, bacterial and viral infections, and cancer. Autophagy literally means ""self-eating"" and describes a process where cells, components of tissues in our bodies, degrade parts of themselves for recycling and re-use. This degradation and recycling process typically serves as an adaptive response, enabling cells to survive conditions of stress such as nutrient deprivation. Similarly, autophagy can protect cells from damaging agents and in this way has been associated with various human diseases and disease treatments. In addition, there is evidence that autophagy is involved in numerous developmental processes such as cell growth, tissue remodeling, removal of cell fragments, acquisition of cellular traits, and longevity. However, the roles of autophagy in these developmental processes remain ill defined. The main objective of our research program is to elucidate the function of autophagy in normal development in the context of a whole organism. To achieve this goal, we will utilize a simple model organism system, the fruit fly, which shares many genetic and cellular components with humans including components required for autophagy. We will develop improved tools to study autophagy in this model system, and characterize autophagy throughout the normal fruit fly developmental lifecycle. Our program will include investigation of autophagy function in fruit fly stem cells which are specialized cells capable of self renewal and tissue generation.  Insights gained from this study will likely provide invaluable insights into autophagy function in mammalian stem cells, including cancer stem cells. Overall, our investigations of autophagy function will contribute to our fundamental knowledge of its role in normal development and this will increase our understanding of its roles in human diseases and potential as a therapeutic target.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Molec. & Develop.

"One of the world's largest nickel deposits, the Sudbury Complex in Ontario, is hosted by 1.85 billion years old igneous rocks. The Huronian sediments, east of the Sudbury Complex, are also enriched in metals and locally, they have elevated concentrations in nickel, copper, gold and cobalt. As the origin of base and precious metals in the sediments have never been identified, a detailed investigation concerning the source of these metals could lead to further discoveries of economic importance in the region. 

There have been several theories concerning the origin of metals in the Huronian sediments, but so far, none of the proposed theories could explain satisfactorily the unusual association of gold, cobalt, nickel, copper, arsenic and platinum group elements.  Because most metals are easily mobilized by hot, saline fluids,  one of the objectives of the proposed study is, to investigates the nature of  circulating hydrothermal fluids in the Huronian sediments. The study will combine field observations with various analytical methods in order to identify geochemical and mineralogical changes associated with metal-enrichment in the sediments. These analytical methods will include chemical analyses of the sediments, identification of various minerals that make up the sediments and the chemical analyses of fluids involved in the transportation and deposition of base and precious metals. Part of the study will be devoted to identifying the fluids instrumental in metal-enrichment of the sediment, to determine the path of the fluid and to identify its origin. Fluid inclusions in minerals can provide useful information on the chemistry and temperature of fluids that mobilized and concentrated the metals to economic grade.

"For many robotic applications there is a need for the integration of human competence with machine ability. In such applications, teams of robots, under the supervision of remote human operators, must coordinate their actions, sometimes to achieve a goal that requires the robots to work cooperatively and, at other times, to work independently without conflicting or colliding with other robots working in close proximity.    One such application is the control of a fleet of semi-autonomous mining vehicles cooperating to improve the production efficiency in underground mining.  The underground mining environment is typically semi-structured and dynamic, and a cooperative robot control structure would allow either fully- or semi- autonomous vehicles to be integrated with human intervention without changing the overall mission goals. The system must provide for effective human intervention that supports the achievement of mission goals, as well as a high-level of reliable task automation by each robot in the fleet.   The motivation for the proposed research program has been ongoing participation in applied research and development projects with Canadian industry that have focused on the automation of full-scale mining vehicles and in-mine demonstrations of these systems. The field of mining automation and robotics has a significant focus on the automation of individual vehicle tasks 



The long-term research objective is to develop technology that will facilitate effective collaboration of human-robot teams. Innovative and effective approaches for controlling a fleet of mobile robots that cooperate under the supervision of multiple human operators will be developed.  The short-term technical objectives include the development of techniques to provide for effective task-preserving human intervention in semi-automated robot missions, the development of techniques to facilitate reliable, vehicle-level automation of component robot subtasks, the development of mobile robotics platforms and simulation tools that support an experimental component of the research that can be used to assess the performance of the technology.

However, in studying biopolymer systems we are keenly aware that the basic science we gather can be used in the development of new structural proteins through genetic engineering and also can provide direction for the development on novel technologies by mimicking designs found in Nature.   In the current proposal we will investigate the following biopolymer systems.

"The Canadian Cosmogenic Nuclide Exposure-Dating Facility (CCNEF) has been in operation since 2002 and is unique in Canada.  The main purpose of the facility is to separate rare nuclides (isotopes) from natural samples and prepare them for accelerator mass spectrometry. Most of the researchers use nuclides that are produced in rock and soil from interactions with cosmic radiation to determine the duration that a landform (e.g. lava, earthquake fault scarp, glacier moraine, landslide, floodplain) has been on the Earth's surface. The terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide methods are revolutionizing earth system science because (i) the age limit of the technique spans decades to millions of years, which means it bounds and bridges many other dating methods for this time period; (ii) it is applicable on any rock type, provided that certain sampling conditions are met; and (iii) it has provided ways to measure erosion over space and time scales that are not attainable otherwise. Since 2002, over 800 samples from around the world have been processed for 10Be, 26Al, 36Cl to quantify timing and rates of important landscape, geodynamic, and biological events and processes, including slip rates of earthquake faults, rates and uniformity of glacial erosion, volcanic eruption frequency, sea level changes, and incision and exhumation of landscapes (e.g. Grand Canyon and Andes), archeological sites, and timing of drainage reorganisation for DNA-based phylogeography.  We also develop the methods and test new applications.  Our next proposed innovation will be the extraction of cosmogenic 14C from quartz and ultra-small masses of specific organic compounds. Students and research faculty in Canadian and foreign academic institutions, and at provincial and federal geological surveys, have used and trained at the facility.

Together, these new technologies will be employed to provide answers to long-standing questions in the Arctic.  These questions include:  Why is there such high mountains and deep valleys along a mountain range that extends from the Torngat Mountains in northern Quebec and Labrador, along northeastern Baffin Island and Devon Island, to Ellesmere Island.

"I am interested in how Earth's landscapes have evolved over different timescales.  Two chronological methods for determining rates and timing of surface processes at timescales between thousands and hundreds of millions of years are revolutionizing the way Earth Scientists analyse landscape evolution.  Terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides (TCNs) produced when cosmic rays interact with exposed minerals in the upper few metres of Earth's surface are used to directly date when landscape change events have occurred, such as the timing of past glaciations, seismic offset of strain markers such as bedrock surfaces or alluvial fans, or the eruption of volcanoes.  Exposure ages of incised canyon walls and bedrock strath terraces can provide information about the variability in incision rates of selected reaches of streams.  Additionally, TCNs can be used to estimate short- and long-term averaged erosion rates of spatial scales from individual mountain peaks to entire stream catchments over timescales of thousands to millions of years.  The second method, (U-Th-Sm)/He low temperature thermochronology, is used to estimate the cooling history of a rock on Earth's surface since it was exhumed from depths of two to four kilometres (minerals may cool at variable rates as they ascend).  The technique is applicable over timescales of tens of thousands to hundreds of millions of years, and can also be used as a tephrochronology tool (to date minerals in pre-historic volcanic ash).  The advantage in coupling both methods is that a more complete understanding of landscape evolution may be attained, in order to address questions such as:  (1) What is the history of earthquake faulting in the Andes? (2) What is the erosion history of the Canadian shield (potential nuclear waste repository)? (3) What is the evolutionary history of the expansive physiographic surfaces throughout the Central Arctic?  Answers to this question help reduce risk to petroleum and mineral exploration in the Arctic. The facilities for these techniques have been established at Dalhousie and my research program will help train undergraduate and graduate students, technical staff, and visiting researchers in aspects of isotope and environmental geochemistry.

"Facial expressions communicate information from which we can quickly infer the state of mind of our peers and adjust our behavior accordingly. The aim of our research program is to examine how the human brain decodes the static and dynamic display of the six basic facial expressions (fear, happiness, sadness, disgust, anger, and surprise) as well as pain, another socially significant emotion expressed facially. We will address three main issues: How efficient is static vs. dynamic facial expression discrimination? What information is used during this discrimination at different stages of visual processing? How universal is this use of information? We will make abundant use of a variant of Bubbles, a psychophysical technique we have pioneered that reveals the information effectively driving a given behavioural response during a recognition task (Gosselin & Schyns, 2001). We will record response accuracy, response time, gaze movements, galvanic skin response, blood-oxygen-level-dependent brain activity, magnetoencephalographic and electroencephalographic activity in healthy Canadian and Japanese individuals, prosopagnosic patients with dammage to the ""occipital face area"" (OFA) or the ""fusiform face area"" (FFA), and patients with dammage either to the insula or the amygdala during the discrimination of sparse facial expressions. This will allow us to address specific questions such as: Which static vs. dynamic features of facial expressions are the most effective in driving a given response in healthy individuals? By comparing this effective information for Canadian and Japanese healthy observers judging the facial expressions portrayed by Canadian and Japanese actors, we will shed new light on the other-race effect. By comparing the effective information for healthy individuals and patients with circumscribed brain lesions, we will better understand the role of the lesioned regions. What features of disgusted faces, for example, are driving the activity in the insula? Is the amygdala sensitive to the eyes in expressions other than fear? What are the FFA and the OFA sensitive to in faces? What is the difference between the processing of right and left brain structures?

"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediates multiple, distinct domains of cognitive functions such as temporal storage of information, behavioral flexibility, and attention.  This raises the question as to how a single brain region such as the PFC may be capable of mediating such a multifaceted cognitive repertoire.  This may be due to a heterogeneous structure, consisting of multiple subdivisions.  Nevertheless, data derived from lesion, functional imaging, and electrophysiological studies of PFC functions rather supports that a specific subdivision of the PFC is still involved in multiple distinct cognitive functions.  Therefore, the role of PFC could be more appropriately understood as integrative between functions, rather than mediating specific cognitive or behavioral functions.  We propose an overarching hypothesis that the PFC could be where no specific brain function could be localized; but rather, the PFC might have roles across multiple distinctive cognitive functions via its interactions with particular sets of afferents from other brain structures.  We will specifically investigate (1) how information is incorporated and integrated from other cortical and subcortical areas into the PFC; (2) how integrated information is processed within the PFC and determines outputs; and (3) how PFC outputs feedback onto afferent areas to regulate their neural activities, using in vivo electrophysiological recordings in rodents, which enables to examine neural activity of neurons in an intact large brain networks.  Moreover, we are planning to extend these studies to investigate how information integration of multiple brain areas in the PFC is translated into cognitive functions a battery of behavioral tests for investigating functional impacts of disconnections of a specific pathway between the PFC and other brain regions.  Our proposed work to examine a highly innovative hypothesis, challenging the dogma of neuroscience that brain functions are localized, will provide a major leap of the concept of brain mechanisms mediating higher cognitive functions that are essential for our daily life.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences"
"The search for new antibiotics to target specific illnesses is an ongoing process.  Recently a new family of compounds, known as the enediynes, has been isolated from bacteria.  This family of compounds is

characterized by all of its members sharing a common chemical structure - the enediyne portion.  If one thinks of the enediyne portion of a compound as the ""head"" then the members of this family differ only in the type of ""tail"" they possess.  The enediynes have been shown to exhibit anti-tumour activity and the anti-cancer activity is provided by the enediyne (""head"") portion of the molecule.  The enediyne structure is simply a series of carbon atoms joined by double and triple bonds.  When these bonds react they form radicals which are known to cleave DNA.  To date, researchers have focussed on investigations of simple enediyne containing compounds (containing simple ""tails"") in an effort to understand the way in which these compounds become activated to target cancer cells.  We propose to study enediynes with ""tails"" which, while still simpler than those found in the naturally occurring compounds, have more chemical features in common with them the those previously studied. New model compounds will be prepared and the best method to react the enediyne to form the active radical intermediate will  be determined.  It is anticipated that the new molecules will function as anti-cancer drugs, to be tested in clinical studies.

       A second investigation underway, is an examination of sulphur containing compounds.  To date, numerous studies have been carried out on the analogous oxygen containing compounds.  Since sulphur and oxygen are in the same family of the table and share similar properties, replacing the oxygen atom by a sulphur atom may result in similar  chemistry.  This research will focus on new methods of synthesizing carbon-carbon bonds using the chemistry which is known for oxygen and comparing it to the chemistry of our sulphur containing compounds.

"Following the advent of new high throughput biological technologies that have been developed to better characterize and understand the human genome, statistical genomics has emerged as an important research area within the field of statistics and computational biology. Because these new high throughput experiments generate huge data files; there is an important need for new statistical methods that can be used to process the data and extract relevant information. High-throughput genomic data are starting to play an increasing role in health research, with companies beginning to track side effects and sometimes responses of patients based on genetic markers (pharmacogenomics). The problems these new technologies created (and are creating) are mostly statistical in nature and biologists lack the expertise to properly design and analyze experiments. For example, sampling variability is often not acknowledged or ad-equality measured and it is not unusual for genomics papers to report estimates without any measure of variability (e.g. error bars). Statisticians have an important role to play, and this should be as early as possible. Indeed, if we statisticians do not proactively participate in the biotechnology revolution, other scientists will try to do statistics whether they have the requisite quantitative expertise or not. Currently, Canada as a nation has the potential but is not actively taking advantage of its capacity to combine health innovation with statistical innovation. The overall goal of my research is to fill this knowledge gap and develop computational and statistical tools that can be used to better understand biological systems.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Statistical Sciences"

"The investigators from the Groupe de Recherche sur les Maladies Infectieuses du Porc and the Groupe de recherche en m�decine �quine du Qu�bec at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (FVM), U. de Montr�al, and the Faculty itself constitute a diversified group of fundamental immunobiology researchers and clinicians who share the same goal: to increase our knowledge on the mechanisms underlying diseases induced by prominent animal and zoonotic pathogens as well as immunological disorders such as asthma. The research aims to identify critical mechanisms of protective immunity against these pathogens and to help advance the development of novel vaccines, improved immunotherapies and diagnostic tools. Our research involves divergent but inter-connected disciplines, such as molecular biology, host-pathogen interactions, basic immunology and bacterial pathogenesis. Our research approaches require analysis of cellular responses of specific cell types from diverse hosts (mouse, humans, horses and pigs), for studying biological processes experienced by these cells when facing pathogens or under stress. Many cell types, such as dendritic cells and NK cells are recovered at low numbers from tissues (especially in the case of mouse work) and the preservation of their viability during experimental manipulations is key for a successful experiment. An automated cell counter, which can generate cell counts, size measurements, and concentration calculations in approximately 30 seconds, allows the generation of data many times faster than manual counting. Thus, high level of repeatability, accuracy and speed are combined to improve the yield and half-life of our cell preparations. Minimal sample amounts are used for counting to a total number much higher than hand-count, thus reducing counting error and, more importantly, the amount of cellular material required. Viability and heterogeneous cell analysis can also be performed. This technology represents an advantageous tool for achieving our research goals, and will greatly contribute to attain a major aim recently fixed by our group: to centralize at the FMV a unique porcine immunological tool bank to support national and international collaborations.

"Streptococcus suis is one of the most important swine pathogens causing mainly septicemia, sudden death and meningitis. Serotype 2 and, to a lesser extent, serotype 14 are considered important emerging zoonotic agents and human cases have been described in Canada. Our understanding of the virulence factors and pathogenesis of S. suis infection has improved considerably in the last years but remains incomplete. Bacteria may enter via the tonsils or upper respiratory tract and disseminate in the bloodstream to cause septic shock through mechanisms related to an exacerbated inflammatory response. If the host survives, bacteria can reach the central nervous system, where they may induce a strong inflammatory response. This leads to an increase of leukocyte infiltration and intracranial pressure, causing the clinical signs of meningitis/encephalitis. The long-term objective of our research program is to better understand the interactions between Gram positive bacteria and host cells, thereby helping to advance the development of strategies for effective control of bacterial diseases, especially septic shock and meningitis. For the next five years we have three short-term objectives: 1. To further characterize S. suis virulence factors and their role in the pathogenesis of the infection, with specific studies on a) the sialic acid moiety of capsular polysaccharide; b) surface proteins, namely the protective surface protein SAO and the pili encoded by islands F and G; and c) resistance to killing by neutrophils in ""neutrophils extracellular traps"" as possibly conferred by encapsulation, D-alanylation of the LTA and secretion of enzymes with DNase and/or IL-8 serine protease activities; 2. To further delineate the interactions between S. suis and cells from the central nervous system, with emphasis on microglial cells and astrocytes; and 3. To study the receptors involved in inflammation leading to septic shock and meningitis, using our newly developed mouse model of infection. Financial support from NSERC will allow us to accomplish the objectives presented in this proposal, expand existing collaborations, develop new collaborations and maintain our internationally renowned research on this pathogen.

"According to Statistics Canada the fastest growing segment of the Canadian population is the ""over 65"" age category. With increasing age, come the challenges of maintaining mobility, maintaining cognitive function, and keeping increasing numbers of medical problems under control. Many seniors end-up in a hospital setting, or in an institution with a high level of clinician based monitoring, where the cost of care is very high. Allowing older adults to live independently while being monitored is the preferred option for most adults. Many studies have shown that independant living leads to a better quality of life for older adults and reduces the deterioration in their cognitive abilities. This issue is becoming an increasing priority for governments faced with an aging population and limited human and fiscal resources. Research into technologies that enable older adults to live independently will therefore improve their quality of life while reducing the cost of healthcare delivery.

The main objective of this project is to investigate and propose different approaches that could be used to monitor the health and well-being of older adults living in their own homes or in long-term care facilities. This proposed approaches are non-intrusive and do not require any intervention from the home occupant. To achieve this goal, ""Smart Environments"" are equipped with many sensor systems. The sensors vary from simple binary sensors, simple analog sensors, to complex sensor systems. The data from the various sensors is collected and analyzed. It can reveal significant information about the health, well being, and behaviour of the home occupant. Once an abnormal situation is detected, the system initiates the appropriate response such as an audio cue, a call to the next of kin, a call to a designated health professional, a report to a health monitoring organization, or in case of emergencies, a call to 911. Abnormal situations range from sleeping disturbances, to variations in bed entry/exit routines, fever, breathing problems, or falls.

"In our research, we probe the composition of matter with visible and infrared light, using a technique called vibrational spectroscopy.  This technique works on the principle that molecules are a lot like tuning forks. When struck against something solid, like a table, the fork vibrates.  Molecules are a lot smaller; and instead of a table, we hit them with light.  If the wavelength is just right, a molecule can absorb the energy and begin to vibrate: bonds stretch, twist, rock, etc.  Each molecule absorbs a unique set of light energies, which vary with the number and type of atoms in a molecule, and with the ways in which the atoms are connected to each other. We work backward from the set (or vibrational spectrum) of wavelengths absorbed to get information about molecular structure.  Another thing that we can investigate is the amount of light that is absorbed: some vibrations are easier to get started than others.  The differences are known to depend on a molecule's structure; now we are trying to pinpoint the specific factors that make some vibrations different from others.  State of the art computer modeling is combined with measurement of vibrational spectra.  So far, we have concentrated our studies on hydrocarbon molecules, the sorts of things found in oil and gasoline, since these provide us with a vast variety of molecules, all constructed from the same two building blocks: carbon and hydrogen.  These molecules are of great importance in fields such as biology, petrochemicals and the plastics industry.  The knowledge that we gain has many potential applications, from a better understanding of molecular structure and interactions between molecules, to quantification of trace atmospheric gases and biomedical studies.  In this last area of research, biophysical spectroscopy, we record and analyze the vibrational spectra of proteins, such as collagen found in scar tissue, bone and teeth. We also are using the technique to monitor penetration of sunscreen and insect repellent through skin. Finally, we are looking at the spectra of growing fungi, to learn more about these commercially and environmentally important species, at the molecular level.

"Combinatorics is the study of arrangements of sets of finite objects and relationships between them. Research in combinatorics is centrally motivated by applications in other mathematical and physical sciences, and in engineering. Many such applications require only that one determine the number of objects in a set, called ""counting"" the set. In algebraic combinatorics we make extensive use of results and methods from algebra in this study. One of the most fundamental combinatorial objects is called a permutation, which reorders the elements of a finite set. A transposition is a very simple permutation, that simply interchanges the order of (""transposes"") two of the elements. A product of permutations is obtained by successive reordering, and in algebra, the set of all permutations of a set with this product is called the symmetric group.



The purpose of this Research Proposal is to study applications of algebraic combinatorics primarily to algebraic geometry, to problems that have been especially significant in the recent research literature because of the surprising variety of areas in mathematics and physics that their solutions involve. For example, Hurwitz numbers arise in geometry as the number of ramified covers of the sphere, but this is equivalent in purely combinatorial terms to the number of ways in which a given permutation can be expressed as a product of transpositions in the symmetric group with a certain ""connectivity"" condition, and a given number of permutations in the product. These numbers appear in a number of different projects in this proposal, and have been of great recent research interest because they have been significant in the study of 2-dimensional gravity, integrable systems, moduli spaces, enumerative geometry, and combinatorics. Of major  interest in this proposal is to make the interaction between algebraic combinatorics and geometry two-way, not simply solving a geometric problem as stated, but to go further and obtain additional information about the original geometric questions themselves, or suggest new methods of solution within geometry.

"Quantum resources can dramatically enhance the capabilities of several parties to perform quantum information processing (QIP) tasks. An excellent example is entanglement, a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which observable physical properties of two or more spatially separated systems are correlated in a manner that has no classical analog.  In quantum information science entanglement is a key resource for many QIP tasks, such as the experimentally realized quantum teleportation, and plays an important role in the emerging technologies of quantum communication, quantum computation and quantum cryptography. 



Other quantum resources are required for special practical purposes in which the quantum systems are subject to certain natural constraints like the absence of a perfect reference frame shared by all parties, imperfect apparatus, restrictions to Gaussian operations in quantum optics, and other limitations. These additional natural limitations not only lead to new interesting physics and the discovery of new quantum resources, but also have applications in related fields such as quantum cryptography and, in particular, enable one to carry out QIP tasks that are impossible otherwise.  



This research program on ""the capacities of quantum information"" will develop accurate theories and problem-solving tools for the quantification, manipulation and distribution of quantum resources, identify and promote the applications of these new resources, and will collaborate with leading theoretical groups to advance the field of quantum information in the presence of super-selection rules and other natural restrictions. Specific quantum resource theories under consideration include those that correspond to the photon number super-selection rule and the absence of a Cartesian frame.

"Mobile robots must carry out increasingly complex tasks involving collaboration between two or more robots. These new conditions require a better knowledge of the environment, of the position of the robot,

and of forces applied to and by the robot in a more precise manner than permitted by traditional approaches. The increasing power of embedded microprocessors, the higher quality of small video cameras, the miniaturization of sensors (accelerometers, gyro-meters, ...) using MEMS technologies (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems), combined with lower costs of production open the door to the utilization and integration of these technologies in robotics applications which could not cope with the size and weight of traditional sensors.



For example, a mobile robot should be able to navigate on a planar surface with accuracy using odometric measurements to follow the prescribed path. However, inaccuracies about the exact robot geometry, sliding between the wheels and the ground, and reorientation of the robot after a collision with an obstacle will generate increasing errors in position estimates. Using data from additional sensors  (acceleration, angular velocity, landmarks detected by vision, ...), we aim to provide a level of accuracy not yet reached for state estimation given the huge reduction in mass, size and power consumption of new sensors compared to traditional sensors.



The goal of this project is to develop robotic control systems taking full advantage of recent technical breakthroughs in the fabrication of small low cost sensors.

"Organometallic chemistry of transition metals (TM) is arguably one of the central areas of modern science owing to the application of TM complexes in catalytic organic syntheses of petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals for agricultural and food industries. The research proposed in this NSERC Discovery grant application addresses several important and challenging types of homogeneously catalyzed reactions. Part (a) seeks to develop chiral PNN ligands from natural amino acids. We will make a family of chiral PNN pincer-type complexes of four metals (Re, Ru, Os, and Ir) for asymmetric hydrogenation of polar C=O and C=N bonds and production of chiral alcohols and amines. Complexes of this type can also be useful for catalytic reduction of esters and amides. Part (b) deals with the development of novel PCP and PCN carbene ligands incorporating a central pyridylidene (rNHC) fragment. Our computational data predict that such ligands should act as exceptionally powerful electron donors when forming pincer-type complexes. These complexes of Ru, Os, Rh, and Ir will be applied in catalytic C-H and N-H bond activation, dehydrogenative coupling, and dehydrogenation and functionalization reactions of hydrocarbons. The PCP and PCN pincer carbene complexes will be explored for nitrogen hydrogenation in an effort to enhance existing ammonia technology and develop new state-of-the-art TM-based catalysts. The proposed research presents an excellent opportunity for training of undergraduate and graduate students  in organo-transition metal chemistry, main-group and organic synthesis, catalysis, and computational chemistry.

"Our research program focuses on the application of advanced, high-resolution solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) methods to characterize structure-property relationships in ion conductors. The two areas of interest are proton-conducting materials for fuel-cell membranes, and inorganic cathode materials for lithium ion batteries. In this proposal, we extend our interest to include two new types of proton conductors, namely solid acids and ionic liquids. All of these materials are linked by the common goal of achieving clean, portable sources of energy. Using solid-state NMR, we are able to probe the molecular-scale mechanisms and process which govern ionic transport; the rate-limiting step in the use of either proton or lithium ion conductors. We expect that these results will impact the design and development of new, improved materials in these areas.

     Students trained in my group are learning state-of-the-art solid-state NMR methods, as well as developing expertise in electrochemistry and materials science. Our primary characterization methods include high-resolution 1-H and 6,7-Li solid-state NMR, achieved under fast magic angle spinning conditions. This is coupled with advanced pulse sequences, to probe both structure and dynamics on the local level. As well, my students learn electrochemical techniques, including controlled cycling of battery materials, and ionic conductivity measurements using impedance spectroscopy.

     Materials of interest in this proposal include recently developed proton conductors, which do not rely on high humidity conditions for successful proton conductivity. Examples include solid acids such as cesium di-hydrogen phosphate, ionic liquids based on imidazole, as well as novel dual-functional polymers which incorporate both proton donor and acceptor into their backbones. In cathode materials, we are focusing on open framework ion conductors, including lithium vanadium fluorophosphates.

    Our main objective is to determine structure-property relationships in ion conductors, and thereby aid in the design of novel materials.

"Incredibly, although speech is one our most well-developed functional behaviors and is the most common feature of our everyday lives, we still have at best an incomplete understanding of how the human speech production process operates at a fundamental sensorimotor level The significance of this lack of knowledge impacts many areas of human communicative behavior, from speech and language development to the treatment of neurological disorders of speech and language. The primary focus of this research is the continued development of a neurobiological perspective on speech as a sensorimotor control system used by humans to communicate.

Overall, three areas of research are proposed addressing the role of sensory feedback and multisensory interaction in speech motor control, on the use and characteristics of internal models for speech motor control, and on the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological differences that distinguish communicative behavior from other comparable nonspeech oral actions. The unique aspect of our research approach is in the application of multiple and complementary tools to address issues of speech motor control.  Moreover, the issues are fundamental to formulating a deeper understanding of the neural process of speech and other related sensorimotor behaviors. Together, the findings will add substantially to a growing body of literature on the sensorimotor characteristics of the speech production process and the neural mechanisms underlying human communication.",Psychology,"Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences"

"One of the greatest challenges in life sciences is to understand the complex relationship between the amino acid sequence of a protein and its three-dimensional shape. Protein folding is so complex because of countless ways an unfolded peptide can reach the functional folded structure. By avoiding averaging, single-molecule methods are uniquely suited to follow individual folding pathways, test and improve the current models. My research program will make use of an innovative fluorescence microscope that records simultaneously the wavelength, the emission time and the polarization of each photon. The evolution of several molecular parameters can be tracked simultaneously and the accuracy of distance measurements through resonance energy transfer (FRET) will be improved. I will study proteins of different size, origin and function under conditions that favor frequent transitions between the folded and the unfolded state(s). The time course of folding will be detected using a combination of FRET and new environment-sensitive probes. In the cell, protein folding may start at very early stages of peptide synthesis along a narrow tunnel spanning the ribosome, but the characteristic dynamics and conformational changes remain elusive. It is expected that multiparameter single-molecule studies will provide a unique insight into the folding dynamics of nascent peptides, the interaction with the ribosome and with helper biomolecules (chaperones).","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","General Physics"

"Roads and highways in Northern Canada are negatively affected by settlement and lateral spreading associated with warming climates in regions of degrading or degraded permafrost.  The roads are important lines of communications and supply for many northern communities. Current remedial measures include frequent regrading and resurfacing.  However, this often provides only temporary solutions that merely compound the problem.  Road clearing and asphalt surfacing make the problems worse by adding weight and heat inflow.  Many roads require remedial work several times each year.  Concern for accessibility and current climate trends means that the problems have become issues for public safety and economics.  

The objectives of the research are as follows.  

1)    )	Understanding the driving mechanisms producing serviceability failures in Northern roads.

2)    )	Developing a new predictive elastic-thermoplastic numerical model to assist in better understanding the failure mechanisms and behavior of road embankments.

3)    )	Performing geotechnical site classification and monitoring through field and laboratory testing at an instrumented site near Thompson, Manitoba, about 800 km North of Winnipeg.  This part of the project is funded by Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation. 

4)    )	Developing a system to help identify 'at risk' sections for the probability and consequences of failure.  

5)    )	Evaluating suitable remedial measures and construction techniques for new and existing roadways. 

This project is significant because it will provide a better understanding of the behaviour of road embankment structures on degrading (or degraded) permafrost in Northern Canada.  Numerical simulations will help develop suitable initial and remedial designs that will improve the performance of these roads. In addition, pavement engineers may be able to use elastic thermoplastic modeling to examine improved pavement designs and construction techniques for warming climates.

"Complex disorders such as diabetes, asthma and cancer likely involve a number of genes acting in concert with lifestyle choices and environmental exposures to increase an individual's risk to develop disease. Efforts to find the underlying genes by studying inheritance in families have been hampered by low power and, consequently, have met with only limited success. As a result, biomedical investigators are now turning to population studies that correlate presence of the disease or other disease-related traits to variation in DNA sequences. Collecting such association data is expensive. How can we make the best use of these data resources? Efficient statistical analyses of the data are key. For example, how can investigators optimally extract information about whether or not genes interact with the environment in determining a person's disease risk? Another question is how to handle genomic data, known as haplotypes, that are incompletely observed and have complex underlying dependencies due to the fact that all individuals are distantly related. Finally, how can we effectively incorporate into studies of human populations previously available information from other types of studies such as those on animals or cells? This research will investigate all three of these statistical questions and develop and disseminate, as freely available software, analytical tools accessible to the wider biomedical community. Statistical methods and software developed during the course of this research will be validated and refined using data from ongoing studies of biomedical collaborators. Internationally and within Canada, there is a critical lack of capacity in genetic epidemiology and related research areas such as statistical and population genetics. As a result, the Institute of Genetics at the Canadian Institutes for Health Research has declared genetic epidemiology a national strategic priority for training. The proposed research will provide training opportunities in the statistical underpinnings of this applied strategic area. Highly qualified personnel with such a statistical foundation  will be well-placed to contribute to interdisciplinary health research benefitting the next generation of Canadians.

"Neutrinos, a fundamental component to the constituent matter of the universe, are similar to electrons but are many orders of magnitude lighter and have no electric charge.  This makes neutrinos, of which there are three types, extremely difficult to detect and, although first experimentally discovered more than fifty years ago, their properties are still poorly understood.



The recent measurements by SNO, SuperKamiokande, Kamland, and other experiments, have shown that neutrinos change flavour and have mass.  These measurements are only sensitive to the difference of the squares of neutrino masses and the absolute mass scale is not yet known.  Some of the most important remaining questions regarding neutrino properties include: What is the neutrino mass scale?  How are the masses of the three known neutrinos ordered? Are neutrinos their own antiparticle?  



Discovery and precise measurement of neutrinoless double beta decay, the process in which two neutrinos in a nucleus simultaneously decay to two protons and two electrons, can provide answers to these questions.  The hardware requested in this proposal will be utilized to develop detector technology that will lead to a sensitive search for the neutrinoless double beta decay of xenon 136 atoms.



The requested hardware consists of a pressure vessel able to operate at pressures up to 10 bar and the internal components required to construct a gaseous xenon time projection chamber with a novel electroluminescence gain stage.  The detector will be used to evaluate and optimize the energy resolution and tracking information of 1 MeV  electrons.  The longer-term goal is to scale up the technology first to a 200 kg xenon mass and ultimately to a multi-tonne detector.

However, there has been comparatively little improvement in games' support for social interaction. In this strategic project, we will develop novel technologies for improving the social interaction afforded by games. We will create toolkits that make it easier to develop multiplayer games, and that reconfigure game implementations to improve the player's quality of experience. We will also develop techniques that enable richer interaction between players: more expressive avatars, immersive integration of player voice into games, and the use of video to provide rich awareness information. Finally, we will develop techniques for supporting broader participation in games, allowing differently-abled people to participate in multiplayer games. Through our close interaction with five industrial partners, we will ground our work in a strong understanding of current industrial practice and requirements, and will provide a clear path to adoption and eventual commercialization of our results. Our partners work in areas that are highly relevant to the research, including game development, development tools, and provision of network services. The project will lead to the training of 21 highly-qualified personnel at the Ph.D., M.Sc. and advanced undergraduate levels. These graduates will have ideal training for future employment in Canada's burgeoning game-development industry.","Computer software","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Communications and Information"
"Computers are increasingly used to help people to collaborate. Email has become ubiquitous, and is now complemented by technologies such as instant messaging and short message service (SMS) on mobile phones. Wikis allow collaborative creation of web sites, supporting collaborative projects. Electronic meeting systems have become a popular alternative to co-located meetings, allowing people to converse and share documents in real time. Modern personal digital assistants have blurred the line between telephone and computer, supporting wireless connectivity for email, agenda updates, SMS and voice functions. Modern online games allow thousands of people to interact in real time in a shared persistent environment. Tools such as these are difficult to build. They require simple yet powerful user interfaces that allow people to collaborate as effectively as when they meet in person. At the same time, collaborative systems are built on top of the Internet, and therefore suffer the consequences of its inadequate speed and unreliable operation.



We will develop techniques allowing easier construction and experimentation with collaborative systems. Based on our earlier work in software architecture for groupware systems, we will create a toolkit simplifying the programming of high-performance applications allowing people to collaborate in real-time, using devices as diverse as laptops, standard PC's, and smart telephones. The toolkit will help make applications robust to failures in these devices or in the networks used to connect them. We will illustrate the benefits of our tools through two applications: a computer-aided exercise game that allows people of diverse fitness levels to exercise together from different locations, and an augmented reality tabletop allowing a group of people to engage in collaborative game design. This research will lead to the training of 10 graduate students in advanced software engineering and usability evaluation techniques.","Computer software","Computing and Information Sciences - A"

"The software that most people use is designed and packaged to run on a single device (e.g. a spreadsheet running on a personal computer). Exceptions to this approach are normally restricted to high-end scientific and business applications that do not run on conventional desktop machines or personal computing devices (e.g. cell phones, PDAs, etc.). This ""standard"" programming approach implicitly assumes an underlying model of computing where everything is done on a single, general purpose computer. This model, however, is quietly fading as new mobile and embedded devices become prevalent. Increasingly, such interconnected devices are collaboratively involved in computations. Among the multitude of examples of this phenomenon are Peer-To-Peer file sharing applications and multi-user gaming (at the large scale) and multimedia tools running on iPods, cell phones, etc. (at the small scale).

   In this proposal, I argue that continuing to assume that programs should be monolithic entities running on a single machine and licensed to specific individuals is overly restrictive and should be replaced. I suggest an alternative model based on executable components (i.e. pieces of runnable programs performing self-contained functions) that may be dynamically ""composed"" to create applications on the fly that are tailored to specific user and environmental characteristics. Such dynamically constructed applications can be run more efficiently both on and across a wide range of interconnected devices. For example, consider a scenario where a user needs to edit a document while travelling using a mobile device with limited capabilities. Normally the user would have to pay for and pre-install a large, complex and costly application to support editing the necessary document on the mobile device. In my proposed approach, only the necessary parts of the software would be dynamically composed on demand to run on the mobile device (and, if necessary, on one or more nearby machines offering compute services). Further, thecomposed software could be tailored to suit the small screen size and limited reliability of the device's wireless connection to the Internet.

"My research program is aimed at generating reliable estimates of major branches of the land plant 'Tree of Life'. Phylogenetic trees have a tremendous impact in diverse fields of biology. They provide evolutionary biologists, systematists and geneticists with historical frameworks for studying plant biodiversity, allowing us to test hypotheses on how plants and their genomes evolved, and to create classification schemes for life on earth that reflect evolutionary history. They also identify groups that were previously unrecognized as deep phylogenetic lineages, flagging them for more detailed study and increased conservation attention. Much of what we know about plant phylogeny comes from the genomes of plastids (chloroplasts), which are the organelles that perform photosynthesis in green plants.  We will take advantage of advances in DNA sequencing technology to recover the whole plastid genomes of multiple plant species.  These data sets will provide additional power to resolve phylogenies, allowing us to tackle problems that were previously too difficult to address, including problematic root nodes of several major branches of the Tree of Life.  In one test case, the water-hyacinth family, we will balance this plastid phylogenetic information with multiple single-copy genes from the nuclear genome. Some plants steal nutrients from fungi involved in an underground food web with green plants, and consequently have lost or reduced their ability to photosynthesize.  We will sequence the plastid genomes of these mycoheterotrophic plants and compare them to their green relatives, to examine how this major nutritional shift affects patterns of gene retention and loss, and the rate of molecular evolution. These new data will allow us to test the prediction that some genomic changes precede the evolution of full-blown mycoheterotrophy, and will provide novel insights into the non-photosynthetic functions of plastid genomes.

"The body has a very limited capacity to store carbohydrates and yet they are vital to life. The stores are in the form of a compound termed glycogen and it is found primarily in liver and muscle. The latter tissue is 35-40% of our body and it contains the majority of the body's stores. In situations such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, a very early and critical development is that the ability of the muscle to take up and to store carbohydrate is serioulsy compromised. This is associated with greater demands on the body to produce insulin and is a fundamental characteristic of type 2 diabetes. Thus, the understanding of the regulation of these stores in important for both medical and basic science reasons. There is evidence that the amount of glycogen that is in the muscle regulates its own metabolism and can prevent the muscle from taking up more  carbohydrate. The stores are also thought to turn on or off a variety of genes involved in metabolism. This in turn changes the metabolic capacity of the muscle and thus, of our body. While the existence of glycogen has been known for over 100 years and has been studied in humans for 50 years, the details of its regulation remain unknown. Glycogen is found in distinct structures or granules and Dr Graham's laboratory has shown that these are found in very specific areas of the muscle. He will investigate the metabolic importance of the protein composition, the location and the size of these granules. The granules are highly organized structures of both carbohydrate and a variety of proteins, some of which are enzymes and others act like scaffolding. He will investigate the nature of the interaction of the proteins and how this changes as the granules gain or lose carbohydrate. These actions are very likely fundamental to the regulation of the stores as well as to the functioning and health of the tissue.

"The phenomenal success of database technology is based on the use of high level languages (such as SQL) and on the ability of the query processor to perform optimization tasks, i.e.  to render the query into a form that can be efficiently executed. The state-of-the-art technology works well in the traditional client-server relational or object-oriented setting. However, with the emergence of the {\em World Wide Web}, as well as with the proliferation of electronically stored data, the client-server architecture as well as the relational or object-oriented approach are changing. The architecture is moving towards data sourc (databases, file-servers, web-pages, XML-document) interconnected through various mediators, integrators, peer-to-peer connections, and the data model is moving towards semi-structured data and XML. The new environment poses the multifaceted challenges of integrating data from different sources, while mapping schemas and data, reconciliating conflicting data, handling incomplete information and uncertainty, tracing the source of the data, and assigning reliability to it. Although each of these aspects have been studied in isolation before, their interaction poses some hard problems to be solved in order to guarantee semantically correct query answers and efficient query processing.

"Investigation of molecular processes leading to cell morphological remodelling is key to understanding cellular function such as adhesion, motility, differentiation and the modulation of barrier functions.  These functions can be, to a certain extent, assessed by optical microscopy techniques by fluorescently labelling constituents of the cell such as element of the membrane, the cytoskeleton or the various cytosolic proteins. Despite the wealth of information provided by these experiments, there is still a lot to be learned on the involvement of individual elements in cellular processes. My research interest focus at mechanically and structurally relevant molecular processes occurring at the level of individual cells. The exploration of molecular processes governing physiological functions has significantly benefited from the emergence of novel techniques allowing for label free detection of cellular mechanical and structural activity. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) in force measurement mode and the optical trap can be used to investigate a multitude of mechanically relevant cellular events in individual living cells with great force and spatial sensitivity. The monitoring of structural changes occurring in cell layer are also amendable to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) which is a technique exquisitely sensitive to mass movement occurring in the vicinity of a surface.  As demonstrated in our recent progress, the application of these techniques in cell biology will provides crucial information for an in-depth understanding of mechanisms related to cellular movement and morphological regulation in physiological context.

"I propose to continue my research in two main areas:



(i) Dynamic pricing and revenue management - Notwithstanding the fact that it is broadly recognized that competition is a major issue in choosing the right pricing strategy, most models in the revenue management area focus on the monopoly setting wherein a single retailer, having a fixed stock, aims to maximize his profit over the relevant horizon.  Recently, we have incorporated competition in a finite, multi-period, fixed inventory settng, by considering two profit-maximizing retailers, each of whom can satisfy the entire market, who compete over prices.  We have first considered a simple competitive setting, wherein the retailers are symmetric and consumers are restricted to a zigzag visiting pattern.  Subsequently, the model was extended to account for more general visit patterns of consumers, non-symmetric retailers, and oligopolistic competition. Some important extensions that will be pursued include incorporating strategic consumers to monopoly and duopoly competition models and imposing capacity constraints and partial information in our models.



(ii) Qualitative sensitivity analysis - The second area is concerned with the development of a qualitative sensitivity analysis theory of optimizatin.  This theory is particularly helpful for large scale problems where it is prohibitively expensive to make sensitivity analysis explorations by conventional methods. We have successfully developed a theoretical qualitative analysis framework for deterministic optimization problems, and we propose to study two main extensions to this theory.  The most important extension is to stochastic optimization problems.  Such an extension could then be used to analyze, e.g. non-deterministic production planning, currency and energy management problems.  The aim of the second extension is to develop a qualitative theory to help evaluate the reliability of a network system of components.

"Canadian northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) market pulps represent the worldwide benchmark for fibre strength, length, fineness, and uniformity. Better pulp quality control, especially its fibre strength, is important to maintain this superiority in the marketplace. Fibre strength depends mainly on intrinsic fibre properties such as the degree of cellulose crystallinity and chemical constituents such as lignin, hemicullose, and hexenuronic acid (HexA). These intrinsic properties also affect processing, such as digestibility and bleachability. In addition, the degree of fibre deformation incurred during pulping process also affects how the fibre delivers its strength in a network during sheet formation. All of these parameters have been shown to be important, however, aside from lignin, none can be easily measured in a timely manner for process control.  The present research will prove principle on a novel Raman system, and systematic chemometric approach allowing for rapid spectral data acquisition and definitive spectrochemical analysis of wet pulp under harsh manufacturing conditions. Electro-optical instrumentation research will lead to backscattering sampling geometries and confocal parameters, coupled with express laser wavelength, power and resolution, all selected to maximize the information contained in signature spectral features. The instrument system will incorporate sophisticated chemometrics strategies, employing wavelet transform and template-guided genetic-algorithm feature selection with multivariate classification to extract maximum analytical information from raw Raman spectra. A program of analysis correlating spectrochemical observations with conventional characterization of fibre and end-use sheet properties will prove principle toward a comprehensive Raman gauge for the instantaneous determination of pulp quality vis-a-vis paper appearance and strength.

"This proposal requests funds to extend and expand a program of NSERC sponsored research in basic and applied molecular spectroscopy. Research in physical chemistry at the interface with molecular physics will use pulsed laser radiation, tuned in multiresonant excitation sequences, to investigate the relaxation dynamics of superexcited small molecules - in isolation and in cold ensembles.  Here, we will work spectroscopically to study the coupling of the orbital energy and angular momentum of state-selected extravalent electrons with the rovibrionic degrees of freedom of isolated molecular cations. We will maintain a focus on an important set of energetic, open-shell polyatomic free-radical intermediates with the objective of characterizing excited-state structure and dynamics. By charting rovibronic positions and lineshapes, we will obtain experimental information on electron-cation scattering for comparison with theory.  Other experiments will extend further to study the nonadiabatic intermolecular scattering dynamics by which a gas of state-selected high-Rydberg molecules relaxes to form a cold plasma. We have succeeded in establishing conditions under which such a transformation occurs in NO.  New work employing spatial and velocity map imaging techniques together with spectroscopic probes in the THz frequency domain will explore multiscale structural and dynamical manifestations of this quantum phase transition.  Our research in analytical chemistry will explore novel instrumental and informatics methodologies that facilitate the application of Raman spectroscopy for multivariate materials classification in contexts ranging from industrial process monitoring to molecular biology. Research using dynamic alignment by means of actuated objectives will enable us to devise new mapping and spatial averaging approaches. We will develop and characterize powerful multivariate classification algorithms to enable us to track subtle spectral variations with the aim of isolating targeted signatures in the presence of uncorrelated variance. Information processing will extend to incorporate bright-field optical cues to establish new chemometrically driven smart-scanning modalities.

"Coastal estuaries and bays are sites of strong environmental gradients caused by tides, winds and river flow. Bottom sediments are a manifestation of this variation, with bottom habitat (sand, mud, plants) reflecting the energy of the environment and development of animal communities. The shallow well-mixed water column insures that the bottom influences overlying waters by resuspension of sediments and organic debris, and release of nutrients from decomposition. Material produced in the water column (phytoplankton) sinks to the bottom where it fuels these processes. The rate at which material is cycled between the bottom, water column, and coastal ocean determines how estuaries deal with pollution, excess nutrients, and a variety of stresses. Although there is some understanding of the range of different habitat types, their relative importance is not well known. For example, it is expected that decomposition will be greater in organic-rich mud than in clean sand, but this level of spatial resolution is rarely included in the models that are used to make predictions about the functioning of coastal ecosystems. The proposed research will document variation in coastal habitats as well as the rate at which physical exchange, decomposition, and primary production (plants, microalgae) occur in these habitats. I will use remote detection techniques such as acoustic seabed mapping to define habitat variation. A series of detailed measurements on decomposition, plant growth, and other processes will be measured in multiple locations, allowing a match between environmental conditions and their role in ecosystem functioning. This information will then be input to improved ecosystem models to allow greater capability in prediction of effects from nutrient loading, resource extraction, fisheries, commercial development, and climate change.

"Bayesian networks are a means of exploiting conditional independence information in a joint probability distribution to facilitate both a more compact representation of the distribution, and faster inference from the distribution, without sacrificing the integrity of the original information. This is crucial for probabilistic decision-making in settings where variables interact in complex ways, such as medical diagnosis.  It also facilitates and improves the accuracy of classification, forecasting, and fault diagnosis. Any software that improves the efficiency of decision-making, without sacrificing accuracy, makes deployment on consumer hardware more feasible.



One of the major criticisms of using Bayesian networks in application is that their computational demands are often very high, both in terms of runtime and memory. Furthermore, many algorithms for computing over Bayesian networks use very sophisticated data structures and runtime libraries, which require further memory

and sophisticated algorithms. Such implementations are not appropriate for simple architectures (e.g. portable devices), real-time systems (e.g. games) or memory-limited applications.



In our proposed research program, we intend to continue development of streamlined data structures for computing probabilities from a Bayesian network at runtime.   This approach will move much of the probabilistic computation offline, where the cost of computation is typically ignored, and minimizes costly runtime computation.  The computation to be done at runtime will be packaged into a compiled version of the Bayesian network that makes reasonable demands on its host architecture, performing the required computation within the time and space constraints of the application.

"My interests are in understanding and predicting the properties of nonequilibrium and metastable structures.  These include glasses, phase separating alloys and fluids, epitaxially-grown films, solidifying crystals, polymeric plastics, and, indeed, biological systems at the microscopic and macroscopic scales.  



As a specific example, the structural and mechanical properties of materials, e.g, how brittle they are, and how they self-assemble, are determined by a nonequilibrium processing history. This gives rise to a complex structure on the scale of nanometers to microns.  Applications make use of this complex structure by dynamically tuning the morphology to, for example, minimize failure rates of materials under stress. Alloys are strengthened by trapping lattice defects at phase boundaries through nonequilibrium processing, e.g., by subjecting the alloy to heat treatments (some prescription for raising and lowering the temperature), and cold working. What is left is not an equilibrium phase, it is a nonequilibrium material with a tuned microstructure.  Often these complex structures involve scale invariance in an intrinsic and deep way, where a dominant length scale asymptotically controls the evolution of the structure on all scales. Hence, a fundamental issue in physics is involved: where do such complex structures come from, and how can they be understood? 



With my group, I am investigating these and other systems by nonlinear analysis, and large-scale computer simulation. We make use of ideas and analogies developed in other contexts, particularly those developed in the theory of critical phenomena -- namely the deep understanding of fluctuations, correlations, scale invariance, interface dynamics, and the focus on universal issues as manifested through modeling and large-scale simulation --  to understand the origin of complex structures.

"A leading cause of general and commercial aviation accidents is Loss-of-Control (LOC) resulting from an unexpected aircraft upset. Aircraft upset is when an airplane in flight unintentionally exceeds the parameters experienced in normal operations or training. There are a number of different causes of aircraft upsets such as the environment, the aircraft, or the pilot. In an attempt to address the LOC following an upset, airlines have added upset recovery to their training agenda. This training usually includes some kind of ground-based flight simulator training. During the training the simulated aircraft is put into unusual attitudes and the pilot practices the recommended recovery procedures. Unfortunately, current commercial flight simulators do not accurately portray the aircraft behavior and motions during these critical upsets, the training is therefore of questionable value. In fact, there is concern there may be negative training resulting from the poor fidelity of the simulators. The research in this proposal seeks to understand the requirements for ground-based simulation of aircraft upset and recovery, and to develop simulator software to increase the fidelity of flight simulators during aircraft upsets.

"The complexity of real applications and/or the size of the data to be analyzed makes it difficult for exact solutions to problems to be found in reasonable computational time. This is especially true in bioinformatics. Biological models are extremely complex and the data generated by genome sequencing, proteomics, gene regulation, protein/protein interaction and now macro-biology (cell models, organism or ecosystem simulation, etc.) projects often grow exponentially. Providing efficient heuristics to analyze such problems is therefore very relevant.

Dr. Gras propose a research program based on optimization strategies using probabilistically guided heuristics. It is a new domain of heuristic strategies that has emerged recently. It is based on powerful techniques from statistical analysis and combinatorial optimization. This is an innovative and promising approach as a major part of the bioinformatics problems can be represented as optimization problems. Modern metaheuristics, based on the building of a probabilistic model, have proven their potential efficiency to solve such optimization problems. Moreover, due to the construction of the probabilistic model, these methods can reveal very informative knowledge about the intrinsic structure of the data. Dr. Gras proposes to apply such approaches and conceive new ones, associated with the use of expert (biologist) knowledge to solve bioinformatics problems. 

As this program aims to develop tools to analyze biological data that are correlated to Alzheimer disease, cardiovascular disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy and cancer, it can lead to a better understanding of these phenomena and to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and even new therapies. This program also involves the analysis and then the establishment of a model and the simulation of ecological systems. That would be essential for the understanding of evolution of biological populations and of pollution effects on ecosystems.

"The theory of complex systems has been developed by physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists, and researchers from various other fields like biology,  economy, geophysics, sociology, chemistry, etc. Its basis is the observation that all these fields have -- in spite of their obvious differences -- a number of common concepts and techniques. In physics, in particular, it has been realized that complexity represents a third fundamental frontier after the infinitely small (particle physics) and the infinitely large (cosmology). Another stimulus for considering complex systems across the traditional scientific boundaries is the explosion of empirical data, triggered by the exponential increase in computational facilities. Traditional methods of mathematical statistics are often no longer sufficient to analyze these data, and must be complemented by methods from statistical physics such as Monte Carlo simulations, statistical inference and large deviation methods, fractals, dynamical systems, scaling laws, complex networks, and others.

"Mechanical and geometrical properties of rock at grain scale (micro-scale) govern the hydro-mechanical behavior of fractured rock masses at all scales. The overall objective of this research is to develop a novel approach for modeling the hydro-mechanical behavior of fractured rock masses by specifically accounting for fracture roughness and rock microstructure. 

     By making high-resolution measurements of surface roughness and rock microstructure, my students and I will be able to provide the necessary constraints to test numerical and analytical models for describing fractured rock masses behavior, where complex surface roughness geometry, heterogeneous grain distribution, presence of voids and flaws remain very difficult to simulate. 

     The proposed research will address four independent but complementary areas that are part of the overall program of quantifying the role of fracture roughness and rock microstructure (grain size and distribution, mineralogy, presence and orientation of micro-cracks) within the hydro-mechanical behavior of fractured rock at laboratory and rock mass (mine) scale. We will study the influence of 3D microstructure on rock strength at laboratory scale (D1), at mine scale (D2), on joint roughness and joint shear strength (D3), and the role of fracture roughness in the evolution of bio-chemical processes and rock mass permeability (D4).

     Important part of the proposed research aims at ""bringing the laboratory inside a mine"" to directly acquire scaled rock mass parameters to be used in numerical models. It will be achieved by using a high resolution 3D optical scanner that is easy to carry and provides same measurement resolution at both laboratory and field conditions. This new approach will enable my group to acquire the same information regarding rock structure and fracture roughness that today are possible only at laboratory conditions, directly on the site (mine drifts).

"Utility-based pricing has gained popularity amongst financial mathematicians in the past decade as an

economically justified framework to price and hedge securities and contingent claims in incomplete markets. It

is, however, notoriously hard to implement in concrete applications and remains somewhat marginal when

compared with main stream methods used by practitioners. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply the framework to practically relevant financial problems  in a concrete and implementable way, with focus in (a) real options, (b) equity--linked insurance contracts, and (c) agency theory. The central problems in each of these areas can be cast as valuation in incomplete markets, and indifference pricing can be used to either naturally extend or improve the existing paradigms in their respective literatures.  I also plan to use utility--based pricing to address certain problems in credit risk, namely the risk premium in reduced form models and efficient valuation of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). 

Real options are an increasingly important valuation technique in energy and commodity markets, where market incompleteness is pervasive and unavoidable. In the insurance arena, where an aging population is taking  unprecedented interest in managing retirement income with instruments that combine insurance guarantees with the incentives of capital markets, financial engineering techniques such as the ones I propose are likely to become indispensable tools. As for agency theory, the attention devoted to executive compensation in the recent global financial crisis shows the importance of aligning the interests of managers and shareholders in a rational, efficient and transparent manner.

On a theoretical level, the long term objective of this proposal is to obtain a better understanding of the

mechanisms linking indifference prices to equilibrium prices in a trading setting with multiple agents, thereby bringing utility-based pricing closer to mainstream economic theory, strengthening its foundations and enhancing its applicability.

"Much of our behavior is guided towards the attainement of rewards.  Although they vary in complexity, such goal-directed behaviors can be observed in a wide range of organisms, from honey bees and rodents to primates and humans.  We also know that behaviors motivated by rewards are controlled by a specialized brain circuitry that includes 'primitive' structures that mediate behaviors directed towards primary or appetitive rewards such as food and sex.  It also comprises areas of higher cortical function that have been more closely linked to processes such as predicting when an expected reward will be received.  Neurons that contain the neurotransmitter dopamine have long been known to be a crucial link in the endogenous brain reward circuitry yet their precise role remains unclear.  The objective of our research is to obtain detailed information on the conditions under which rewards come to activate these dopamine neurons.

"The proposed research program aims at expanding the scope of organocatalysis as it stands today through the development of new classes of catalysts and their application to new reactions.

  Asymmetric catalysis using organic molecules (organocatalysis) has recently emerged as a powerful approach for the synthesis of organic compounds in an enantioselective fashion. Despite the great advances accomplished in this area, most methods developed so far show a narrow scope of reagents. Also, the catalysts reported to date show very little variety in their scaffold and the nature of their catalysis. The purpose of this research is to develop new classes of organocatalysts and new catalytic modes of action that will complement and expand existing methodology. In order to achieve these goals, three different areas will be explored: asymmetric phase transfer catalysis, multifunctional catalysis, and Lewis base-catalyzed Diels-Alder reactions.

   In the first part of the program, phase transfer catalysts possessing novel scaffolds will be synthesized in order to broaden the scope and to improve the stability of this type of catalysts. In the area of multifunctional catalysis, various types of activating groups, such as substituted guanidines, will be introduced. These groups will display increased reactivity as well as the ability to tune their activity through the judicious choice of their substituents. Finally, the application of Lewis base catalysts to the Diels-Alder reaction will dramatically expand the scope of available reactive partners for this very important reaction. In particular, it will allow the use of a wide variety of functionalized dienes that are incompatible with commonly used Lewis acid catalysts.

   The underlying theme of this research program is the asymmetric synthesis of useful chemical building blocks using organic molecules as catalysts.

     The proposed research will focus on two interrelated goals based on technological expansion and applications of toolbox technologies to specific collaborative research for which the on-going technological development is crucial for reasons of prototyping ease, assembly paradigm, and disparate material dependence: 

1) expansion of the microfluidic toolbox for the proposed applications, including: a) improved device-to-device assembly; b) microinstrument technologies based on nanocomposite polymers (NCPs).

2) polymer-based and hybrid modular devices and instruments that rely upon these engineering technologies for applications in: a) studying disease mechanisms; b) disease detection/monitoring. 

      To realize Goal 1, a microassembly platform is proposed based upon our prior experience with designing interconnect structures and rail structures. Nanocomposite polymers are proposed for generic microinstrumentation electronic interconnect, as well as key technologies for applications in sensor design and instrumentation of cell platforms. To realize Goal 2, several initial applications are proposed, including multi-sensor instrumented microchannels for endothelial cell shape versus function studies and electrode-based sensors with improved 3D architecture. Long term goals include adapting existing and proposed technologies to initiating new collaborations in new areas, for which the Microinstrumentation Lab has already been very successful.

"The threat to human health as a result of the growing emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotic agents is both real and significant.  It is alarming to realise that microbial strains resistant to all of the major classes of antibiotics currently in clinical use have been identified, and pan-resistant pathogens are beginning to emerge.  Despite the rapid increase in bacterial resistance, only two new classes of antibiotics have reached the clinics in the last forty years.

There is, therefore, an obvious and urgent need to develop new antibiotic agents with novel modes of action and new pharmacophores to combat infectious disease.  Natural products chemistry often provides access to unprecedented lead structures with desirable bioactivities and potencies and has uncovered a vast number of biologically active organic compounds with genuine potential to become or inspire new therapeutics, health products, agrochemicals and antifoulants. We are only beginning to acknowledge the full potential of the molecules present in the world's biodiversity and can expect the continued discovery of many useful natural products in the future.  

My research program focuses on the isolation and synthesis of biologically active natural products that exhibit activity against drug resistant strains of pathogenic microbes, and consequently have significant potential as lead compounds for the development of new therapeutics for infectious disease.  We will initially focus on natural products produced by endophytic fungi of terrestrial, marine and freshwater plants. A library of 250 fungal endophyte cultures is currently under investigation, and additional endophytic strains will be isolated, cultured and extracted to augment our collection. Extracts that exhibit promising bioactivity will be subjected to bioassay guided fractionation using a suite of pathogenic microbes to isolate and identify the active components in an effort to discover lead compounds for the development of new therapeutics to fight infectious disease.

"In the past few years, the world of lignocellulosics has seen many rapid and radical changes.  On the one hand, the pulp and paper industry in Canada and elsewhere has seen an unprecedented round of ownership change, downsizing and mill closure.  On the other hand, there has been a dramatic growth in interest in lignocellulosics as a source of energy and renewable resources.  This has led to the concept of the ""Forest Biorefinery"" as a development of the traditional pulp mill, with enhanced separation, modification and utilization of the hemicelluloses, lignin and phytochemicals present in wood and agricultural wastes. However, the economic success of such a plant still rests on the effective exploitation of the material properties of the cellulose in the plant cell wall. The objectives of the proposed research is to provide some of the basic physicochemical and morphological information on cellulose and lignocellulosic materials required for their intelligent utilization as both traditional and as novel materials.

 

On the novel materials front, our initial observation of the chiral liquid crystalline properties of aqueous suspensions of cellulose nanocrystals has led to much work around the world on these unique materials.  Unlike most currently-available nanoparticles, the aqueous cellulose-based materials are non-toxic and environmentally benign.  We have completed a detailed study of their phase behavior when mixed with non-interacting water-soluble polymers.  Our next step is to understand their phase behavior when mixed with polymers that interact in a specific manner with the nanocrystals.  In particular, the interaction between the normally anionic cellulose nanocrystals and added polyelectrolyes is of interest both as a problem in colloid science, and as a practical way of producing nanostructured materials.  For example, we have shown that it is possible to prepare polyelectrolye multilayers containing cellulose nanocrystals, and we will continue to characterize the structure and properties of the resultant films by optical and scanning force measurements. Next on the agenda is the preparation of suspensions and composites containing cellulose nanocrystals and photoactive semiconducting nanoparticles.  By exploiting the anisotropy of the cellulose nanoparticles (the reducing sugars are all at one end) it is possible to create novel rod-shaped cellulose nanocrystals, with an optical tag or other functionality at one end.  On a more applied level, potential uses of cellulose nanocrystals as papermaking and coating additives will require careful measurements of their interactions with other colloidal and polymeric species in aqueous suspension.  



We plan further use of cellulose nanocrystal suspensions and films as model Cellulose I materials.  The physical and surface properties of cellulose depend on the nature and degree of crystallinity of the sample, and hence for example the ease of chemical or enzymatic modification.  The suspensions themselves may provide a useful substrate for enzyme interactions, and smooth films cast from nanocrystal suspensions will be used to follow the effects of surface modification on surface force measurements. 

  

The basic question of why the nanocrystals form a chiral arrangement in suspension and in films dried from the suspension remains an open question. We will continue to address this problem, seeking connections to the chiral structures present in plant cell walls. 



While the planned research emphasis is on cellulose nanocrystals, we will seek relationships between nanocrystal structure and the larger dimension lignocellulosic structures found in the plant cell wall.  This I believe is the key to an improved understanding and utilization of what is truly nature's high-performance ""green"" material.

"Thermal conversion of bitumen at over 500?C is a key platform of technology and science for Syncrude's long-term operations. A fundamental understanding of key aspects of this conversion is essential for improving existing operations and for considering longer term process changes and opportunities in bitumen conversion. The links between the mechanisms of cracking, the quality of the coker products, reactor conditions in terms of temperature and residence time, and reactor operability due to fouling of the reactor internals require further research. This project proposes three linked studies to lay the foundations for improved understanding of existing fluid coking operations, and to inform longer term technology development. Synthesis of model compounds will enable the definition of cracking and fouling mechanisms at a molecular level, and support the development of reaction kinetics that link conversion to product quality. Kinetic measurements will use an apparatus that is nearing completion at the University of Alberta, designed to give accurate vapour-phase kinetics over a wide range of temperatures. Kinetic measurements on bitumen fractions and model compounds will define the boundaries for desirable reactor performance. The third project, at the University of Saskatchewan, will investigate the hydrodynamics of reactor fouling, and combine the kinetic data and information on fouling mechanisms to develop predictive models. The first year of the project will give an initial suite of model compounds and define their coking and fouling behavior, measure kinetics under a limited set of conditions, and determine the most promising direction for laboratory and pilot-scale studies of reactor fouling. In the subsequent two years the program would grow to encompass cold-flow particle-liquid measurements to understand fouling processes and the development of a comprehensive kinetics-fouling model.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"
"The objective of this research program is to understand the role of coupling between chemical reactions and diffusion of molecules length scales from a few nanometers to a few microns. The research will investigate two important reactions relevant to energy and the environment; thermal cracking of oil sands bitumen, and the bacterial transport of hydrocarbons into cells and between bacteria in methanogenic consortia. In both high-temperature cracking and in biological conversion of hydrocarbons, the reactions are profoundly affected by the movements of the reacting molecules over short distances. For example, when large molecules in oil sands bitumen break apart at high temperature, we want the cracked fragments to escape to the vapor phase to release valuable products. If the cracked fragments cannot diffuse out of the liquid phase fast enough, then they can react to form low-value coke instead. In bacterial conversion of hydrocarbons, the cell wall plays the key role in determining which compounds enter the cell. Protein pumps within the cell wall can remove compounds such as antibiotics and hydrocarbons from the cell. Understanding and controlling the movement of compounds across the cell wall is a crucial step to using bacteria as effective bioreactors for environmental cleanup and for conversion of hydrocarbons to useful products.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng."

"Energy balance is achieved by regulating the amount of energy consumed through food intake and energy expended by metabolic processes. Our understanding of energy homeostasis has developed substantially in the past decade driven by a desire to understand the physiological consequences of disregulated energy balance. Predominantly, research has focused on the characterization of neuronal pathways involved in appetite regulation. The other side of the energy balance equation, hormonal regulation of energy expenditure, is poorly understood. The neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is expressed throughout the brain with a high level of expression in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain known to be involved in regulating energy balance. PACAP is made by all vertebrates and its protein structure has been highly conserved throughout evolution, suggesting it plays a role in fundamental physiological processes. Previously we generated mice that are unable to produce PACAP.  These knockout mice are unable to regulate body temperature appropriately and if raised at an ambient temperature of 21oC die early in postnatal life. If however the mice are raised at an ambient temperature of only 3oC higher, survival is increased to 80%. These studies demonstrated that the hormone PACAP plays a role in thermoregulation. The mechanism by which PACAP regulates energy balance is still unknown. Our newly generated data suggests appetite is not affected in PACAP knockout mice, yet are leaner than wildtype control mice. Using transgenic animals that lack PACAP and wildtype animals subjected to different environmental temperatures I aim to elucidate the physiological role of the highly conserved neuropeptide PACAP in thermoregulation and energy balance. Additionally we aim to establish if neuronally derived PACAP is responsible for the thermoregulatory problems observed in PACAP knockout mice and to further characterize which PACAP expressing neurons are responsible for these effects. Importantly, studies put forth in this proposal will advance our understanding of the endocrine regulation of energy balance.

"With our aging population in North America it is becoming increasingly important to develop better, less expensive implants and devices. An understanding of the chemistry that takes place at the surface of a biomaterial is essential to improving medical implants. We can use this understanding to change the surface chemistry of the material to eliminate any adverse reactions that can result when a foreign substance is introduced into the human body.  Currently, metallic implants such as stainless steel and titanium are used in orthopedics to fix broken bones or stabilize them after surgery.  In many instances these implants serve no purpose after healing has occurred.  In these cases a biodegradable implant that would provide the necessary stability in the initial stages of healing and would gradually dissolve and be replaced by bone would be advantageous.  We are investigating a new class of biomaterials, magnesium alloys, as biodegradable orthopedic implant materials. Magnesium alloys have many advantages over traditional metallic biomaterials and they are a comparatively inexpensive material. Our research program focuses on understanding the behaviour of magnesium alloys in the human body and developing ways to change their surface chemistry to improve their biocompatibility and control their dissolution rates.  This research program has the potential to make Canada a leader in the development of improved biomedical implants.  This will lead to both economic growth for the country and improved healthcare for Canadians.

"This project will investigate whether retention of living 'green-trees' on harvested sites may minimize the effect of disturbance caused by harvesting on forest ecosystems, and help conserve soil biodiversity and functioning.  We will identify the soil organisms and processes most sensitive to human utilization of forests, and how these can be preserved. Soil organisms have a vital role in nutrient cycling, so preservation of a healthy, functioning soil biotic community is essential for ecosystem function. Currently, only retention of coarse woody debris and limitation of forest floor removal are recommended to protect soil organisms after harvest. However, a more suitable management treatment may be preservation of green tree retention patches on harvested sites, which would provide soil organisms with a living, continually replenishing source of energy from their roots and litter. The effect of harvesting on soil organisms and associated functions is a critical knowledge gap that

precludes certainty about the sustainability of current and proposed forestry practices. The decisive knowledge achieved through this research will allow BC forest managers to develop and use practices that are based on sound, defensible science. B.C.'s Forest Practices Act, Canada's National Forest Strategy and Canada's Biodiversity Strategy all emphasize the importance of maintaining forest biological diversity, the ecological integrity of forests and ensuring sustainable use of forest resources. Current policies, regulations, and guidelines do not sufficiently consider the importance of soil organisms to the maintenance of ecological functions. This is largely because the scientific information does not yet exist to guide decision-making.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Environment 1"
"Forestry has a critical role in Canada's economic prosperity with nearly half Canada's landmass being forested and 10% of the world's forests being within Canada. In British Columbia forestry is the key industry with 56% of BC being forested. In addition, forests are vital for moderating climate and filtering air and water and as places of recreation. There is increasing emphasis on sustainable forest management, balancing resource extraction with retention of ecosystem services and biodiversity. In order to provide a basis for rational decisions forest managers must have sufficient knowledge about how forests function and how their management affects that functioning. Nutrient cycling and uptake have been shown to be critical processes for the health of forest ecosystems. The soil microbial community has a key role in nutrient cycling processes in soil through decomposition of soil organic matter and turnover of inorganic nutrients and minerals and, therefore, forest productivity. Despite the recognised importance of the soil microbial community in nutrient acquisition for trees we know very little about the diversity of microorganisms in soil, what their functional roles are and what factors influence the size, the structure and the activity of the microbial community. Developing management strategies for these systems requires an understanding of the processes regulating soil nutrient cycling and the impact of various management practices on these processes. This research program uses a variety of novel molecular and biochemical methods coupled with stable isotope labeling approaches to identify the important micro-organisms, elucidate their role in soil processes such as nutrient cycling and the storage or release of carbon, and clarify the manner in which they interact with plant roots. This will result in a better understanding of ecosystem functioning.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","Plant Biology & Food Science"

"Polyembryony refers to a unique form of reproduction in which a single egg results in multiple progeny, maximizing the reproductive capacity of the species. Study of the phenomenon of polyembryony in insects has the potential for addressing one of crucial questions in the evolution of development: How do developmental novelties arise? Polyembryony in insects represents a developmental novelty whereby both precursor structure and evolutionary processes are basically unknown. Copidosoma floridanum is a polyembryonic parasitic wasp that undergoes total cleavage and despite its relative close relatedness to Drosophila exhibits a major deviation from the canonical insect early developmental program. Copidosoma development consists of three phases: early cleavages, which leads to formation of a single proliferative morula; the novel proliferative phase, that generates thousands of embryos; and the morphogenetic phase, where the patterning of individual embryos takes place. Previously, we have shown by laser ablation that caste fate and embryo proliferation in Copidosoma are regulated by a single cell at the four-cell-stage embryo, which also specifies the germ line. This differential allocation of determinants to a specific cell serves as a starting point for the functional dissection of individual genes in the process of embryo proliferation and patterning.","Advancement of knowledge","Molec. & Develop. Genetics"
"One of the aims of developmental biology is to understand the mechanisms underlying the diversification of plant forms. We are using a set of five late-flowering Arabidopsis ecotypes that form naturally selected variant morphology in which vegetative structures continue to initiate even during the plant's reproductive development. This morphological change impacts the life history traits and expends the plant life span from months to years. We previously established key genetic interactions between genes that specify this morphology. In the next step, our aim is to identify downstream targets and key effectors involved in specification of such morphology by taking advantage of GeneChip and tiling arrays. Identification and characterization of specific alleles that have been favored by natural selection would allow us to gain an insight into mechanisms of evolution and to exploit them for environmentally friendly plant biotechnology. Our previous work identified novel floral repressor that acts to delay the onset of reproductive development in plants. Our data suggest that the analysis of remainder of ecotypes may identify additional floral repressors. In addition to contribution to the fundamental understanding of regulation of plant reproductive development, this research project provides tools for the environmentally focused biotechnology of crops using naturally occurring gene regulatory interactions. Our discovered genetic regulatory interactions are crucial for production of maximum biomass, and containment of a transgene, which is required for further development of plants as bioreactors.

"The algae with chlorophyll c, especially diatoms and dinoflagellates, are a major part of the marine biosphere. They absorb sunlight using chlorophyll-containing light-harvesting antennas and use it to fix carbon dioxide, a process called photosynthesis. By  removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, they contribute significantly to regulation of global climate. In spite of this, they have not received much attention compared to their green plant relatives on land. My research program integrates information from genomics, molecular biology and biochemistry to understand how these algal cells assemble their photosynthetic apparatus, and how they adjust to changes in light intensity, nutrition and temperature in order to survive daily life in the ocean.

"My research concerns those factors that govern the maintenance of biological diversity, with an emphasis on amphibians. The landscape is my laboratory and in it I study the ecology, biogeography, conservation and genetics of amphibians at large and small geographic scales. Amphibians are normally abundant and important components in freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. Nevertheless, declines in amphibian populations are now well documented. Improved understanding of amphibian populations has enabled predictive models to be formulated concerning how their populations behave. In my work I seek generality of understanding and principle because species endangerment is, fundamentally, unrecoverable range contraction and population loss. But underlying all aspects of landscape ecology there is also dispersal for which no mechanistic models have yet been developed for actively dispersing organisms. Thus my long-term aim is a general understanding of the dynamics of species distributions across landscapes, providing a context within which to comprehend population decline and species endangerment. As steps towards this goal, I will test the hypothesis of extreme philopatry in amphibians and I will test the hypothesized effects of habitat fragmentation on dispersal of amphibians in changing landscapes. I will test the goodness-of-fit of candidate models of amphibian dispersal against a comprehensive data base of animal movements gathered over nearly two decades and I will test the diffusion hypothesis for the spread of disease-causing organisms in frog populations. I will test whether the postglacial range expansion of amphibians into Canada followed a limited number of dispersal routes predicted from geologic history and I will test hypotheses concerning the stability of hybrid zones between species of toads. My program of research will contribute in a substantial way towards understanding what determines the boundaries of species and lineages geographically, ecologically, and conceptually. It will test current ideas concerning why species ranges are limited and it will yield better understanding of the extent of real populations.",Environment,"Evolution & Ecology"
"Long-term declines in the abundance of migratory birds have led to renewed interest in whether migratory bird populations are most affected by events on their breeding grounds, on wintering areas or on migration. Some studies suggest that events on breeding grounds may be sufficient to explain long term declines but others show that events in wintering areas have greater impacts on migratory bird populations. Recent studies have also demonstrated that events on wintering grounds can carry over into the breeding season and influence individual reproductive success and the dynamics of populations on breeding grounds. Investigation of the importance of carry-over effects has been hampered by our inability to follow individuals throughout the annual cycle and the lack of information on the links between wintering and breeding grounds. However, recent technological advances allow examination of migratory connectivity and more detailed investigation of how events on both breeding and wintering grounds influence populations. We will use radiotelemetry and stable isotope analyses of feathers to investigate how winter and breeding grounds are linked, and evaluate the importance of carry-over effects for the population dynamics of a short-distance altitudinal migrant (the American Dipper) and a long-distance neotropical migrant (the Yellow Warbler). Specifically, we will, 1) ask how weather, food availability and density on wintering grounds influence the timing and duration of migration, the onset of breeding and annual productivity of migratory dippers, 2) evaluate how variation in climatic conditions and winter habitat use influence the arrival times, condition and reproductive success of yellow warblers breeding in western Canada (Revelstoke, BC and Inuvik, NWT), and 3) use population models to assess the importance of carry over effects for migratory bird populations.  This research will evaluate the importance of carry-over effects and contribute to our understanding of how climate change and habitat loss on wintering grounds will influence populations of migratory birds.

"Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is an analytical technique for identifying proteins from an unknown mixture, and has become a cornerstone of modern proteomics. Currently, protein identification is relegated to take place offline, after the data collection phase, when it is too late to take corrective action in the case of an ambiguous identification. By sufficiently accelerating the data analysis, it becomes possible to close the feedback loop and achieve true hypothesis-driven data collection. This research program will result in new algorithms for spectral processing and protein identification to enable real-time control of a MS/MS device. 



Although originally designed for the demanding field of high throughput multimedia applications in the Sony PlayStation 3, the Cell BE processor is based on an innovative heterogeneous multi-core architecture and is ideally suited for scientific applications such as online processing of MS/MS data. Careful algorithm design is required to achieve optimal throughput on the Cell BE by leveraging its multiple layers of parallelism, user-controlled cache, and nine independent processors and DMA engines. Many challenging computer science problems arise when developing optimal algorithms in such a complex multi-core environment. 



A recent CFI/ORF grant has provided our lab with the necessary Cell BE equipment and a tandem mass spectrometer. The present proposal will support the development of novel highly optimized algorithms in two areas: i) the processing of raw spectral data, and ii) protein identification using a search algorithm against a database. By simultaneously collecting and analyzing data on a tandem mass spectrometer, new forms of data analysis become possible including more effective identification of low abundance biomarkers. In the long term, this research may lead to novel bench-top and bed-side biomedical devices and have a positive impact on human health.

"North American infrastructure is crumbling. Media reports of dramatic fires, structurally unsafe buildings and failed bridges are becoming more frequent. Many concrete structures are in urgent need of repair or rehabilitation, yet the current economic crisis demands that we develop innovative materials and cost-effective

techniques for repair. 

     Unfortunately, there is insufficient and inadequate information regarding the performance of these repaired structures in fire; especially when new materials are used for repair. For buildings or parking garages, fire resistance is a vital concern to protect public safety as evidenced by tragic events such as the World Trade Center disaster, and dramatic building collapses due to fire in Spain and the Netherlands. Thus, the overall aim of the proposed research is to obtain an understanding of the behaviour of rehabilitated concrete structures in fire. The research will ultimately aim to evaluate how fire impacts buildings as a whole, rather than the behaviour of individual parts.

     The key research questions to be answered are: What are the properties of advanced materials at high temperature? How do these properties affect overall behaviour in realistic fire conditions? To answer these vital questions,  a material testing facility is required to test concrete and related specimens at temperatures as high as +1200 degrees Celsius. Such temperatures are often reached in building fires that are difficult to extinguish, or in fires fuelled by oil or chemical tankers as may occur in a highway

tunnel.

     This project will train 1 post-doctoral fellow, 4 Ph.D. students, 2 M.Sc. students, and 4 undergraduates. These highly qualified personnel will be specifically trained to design structures meeting modern fire protection requirements. Through this research, Canadian citizens will benefit from buildings that can be repaired and constructed cost effectively while protecting public safety.

"Folate is a vitamin required to make DNA and needed by all cells for growth and cell division. Folate requires another vitamin, cobalamin (vitamin B12), to function properly. Folic acid (man-made folate) is often added to animal feeds. In Canada and some other countries folic acid is also added to human foods to help prevent birth defects such as spina bifida. However, increasing folic acid content of the diet without increasing cobalamin may cause an imbalance in these vitamins. Our long-term goal is to study the biological effects of folate and cobalamin imbalance. We hypothesize that high folic acid / low cobalamin diets will change how genes (DNA) are expressed potentially leading to biological problems. To test this, we will determine in adult mice whether a high folic acid / low cobalamin diet alters how genes are expressed and whether this leads to problems in blood vessel function. We will also study whether exposing pregnant mice to a high folic acid / low cobalamin diet leads to changes in gene expression, increased fatness and impaired ability to process glucose in their offspring. Our research will help determine the best ratio of folic acid to cobalamin in the diet. It will also provide evidence as to the safety of increasing the amount of folic acid added to fortified foods and the possible need to add cobalamin.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","Integrative Animal Biology"

"The problem of elevated sodium chloride (salt) levels in soils is as important as petroleum contamination of soils for the upstream oil and gas industry. The remediation of salt impacted soils has proven difficult and costly due to the absence of a technology that is versatile and allows for in-situ or on-site remediation. Phytoremediation (plant-based bioremediation) offers many advantages over conventional removal or chemical-based remediation methods. Unfortunately, salt stress often leads to increased production of ethylene, a plant stress hormone, and results in diminished plant growth. Without high levels of biomass acceptable rates of remediation can not be achieved. Our recently developed multi-process phytoremediation system (MPPS) used for petroleum remediation has potential applications for remediation of salt impacted soils. A key feature of this biological system is the alleviation of plant stress by using plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). These PGPR consume the precursor to the plant hormone ethylene, thus decreasing ethylene biosynthesis in plants. As a result, vigorous plant growth on salt impacted soils can be achieved, and should facilitate remediation of salt from the soil. In our pilot experiments, the PGPRs with the most promising results were two Pseudomonas putida strains (UW3 and UW4). These are the naturally occurring strains of PGPR that we currently use for petroleum remediation. They are on Environment Canada's list of safe and non-pathogenic microbes. In general, we are observing at least a 100 % increase in plant germination and total plant biomass attributable to PGPR. We have assayed for salt remediation in a greenhouse experiment. The results are inconclusive at this juncture. To accurately assess salt remediation we need more data and longer growth periods. This winter in the greenhouse, we will grow plants for longer time periods, allowing more remediation to occur within each experiment. In the Spring, we will proceed with field experiments at 3 salt-impacted sites in Alberta. These sites are associated with the upstream oil and gas industry, and have varying levels of salt contamination.",Environment,"RPP Internal Decision Cttee"

Due to their special structure, elliptic curves have recently found numerous important applications in the field of number theoretic cryptography.  I am currently attempting to develop systematic methods for solving the equations defining elliptic curves.  The key to these methods are a family of results (and conjectures) called modularity theorems, the prototype of which was proved in the 1990s by Andrew Wiles in his landmark proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.

"Questions of interest and importance to us all are how did the oceans, continents, atmosphere and interior of the Earth form, and how do these Earth systems operate and interact today. Answers affect our understanding of present-day climate, human impacts on the atmosphere and ocean, and where to look for resources that sustain society. A problem is that the largest part of the Earth, the mantle (interior of Earth), is inaccessible and our understanding of it is poor. My research uses basalt lava flows to study the interior of the Earth. Basalts are the most common rocks on Earth and they form due to melting of the mantle. Studies of basalts from the ocean basins tell us that there are different types of mantle. For example, one type apparently had elements such as potassium and silicon extracted from it to form the continents billions of years ago. Other types may contain ""recycled"" rocks that were once at the Earth's surface. Mantle rocks beneath the continents appear to have unusual compositions that make them the source of most diamonds. An important question is how the types of mantle formed because they will contain a record of how the planet's oceans, continents and atmosphere evolved. By comparing the concentrations of elements in different ""basalts"" from the ocean basins and continents, it will be possible to answer these questions. However, the comparisons are not easy. For example, when molten basalt crystallizes to form minerals, different elements enter different minerals. Some minerals form early and some form late. The result is that the composition of a basalt changes as elements get used up. This process is called ""differentiation"". Although this complicates studying the interior of the Earth, these processes can lead to ore deposits because some minerals that form are rich in nickel, chromium, platinum and other valuable elements. In summary, the research is of substantial human interest because basalts are important to understanding the evolution of the Earth. However, the work also has economic implications. It may help explain why some ore deposits (e.g. diamonds and platinum) occur where they do, or point to chemical tests that assist in discovering new deposits.","Earth sciences","Solid Earth Sciences"
"In this project we will investigate the model-based pose determination and tracking of satellites in sparse range data. This project builds upon previous work where we have successfully demonstrated these capabilities in uniform random sparse range data sequences. In this project, we will extend this work in two ways, first by applying it to non-uniform sparse range data, which is more representative of the data that could be collected by a space-based system. The second extension will be to investigate issues of performance evaluation, which will allow us to assess and compare tracking algorithms under various conditions. We will also develop an on-line performance monitor that will continuously automatically assess the performance of a tracking system, invoking corrective action when necessary.



The application focus of the project will be the pose determination and tracking of free-flying satellites. There are currently over 8,000 satellites circling the earth: when they malfunction or simply run out of fuel, they become ""space junk"". It has been demonstrated for low earth orbit satellites that it is possible to approach these satellites with a Space Shuttle and retrieve them either manually, or robotically using direct teleoperation. Due to the extreme expense of manned space flight, however, this approach is infeasible on a large scale. In addition, there are future generations of high orbit satellites that will be designed to be serviceable and refuelable in space, but whose orbits will be far beyond the flight range of the Shuttle. This set of factors, combined with the favourable economics of extending satellite life-cycles, present a significant commercial opportunity for the development of an autonomous robotic space vehicle for satellite servicing.

"This project builds upon two areas of ongoing collaboration between Intel and the University of British Columbia. The first topic, formal verification uses mathematical techniques to establish critical properties of designs and avoid costly errors. The second is the development of novel circuit techniques to address challenges in deep-submicron design. This project brings these two areas together in the design of active-inductor circuits and the demonstration of formal methods for analog circuit design.

Inductors play an important role in the interconnect between chips in a larger circuit. The traditional implementation of an inductor using a coil of wire has serious drawbacks when used on-chip. Such passive inductors consume large areas and have severe losses. Active inductors replace the coil of wire with circuits composed of transistors and capacitors that

mimic an inductor's behaviour. Such circuits take good advantage of the small transistors afforded by advanced fabrication processes and provide a further benefit of programmability. However, many issues including robustness, power consumption, and high-frequency limitations still remain.

This project addresses these issues. Formal methods based on discrete models have achieved significant success. This project extends the applicability of formal methods to analog circuits and high-performance digital designs. This project will identify benchmark verification problems, develop a common front-end to be used with several recently developed verification tools, and evaluate these tools using the benchmark circuits. Circuits arising from the active inductor research will be considered along with other examples from high-performance digital design. This process will guide further development of the tools and identify opportunities for incorporating these approaches into commercial design methods.

"The gigahertz race is over.  For over two decades, microprocessors have been doubling in clock speed and performance every one or two years.  In the past two years, this exponential trend has been replaced by a slow climb.  Heat is the culprit -- the technological trends that drove CPUs up in speed also drove them up in power consumption.  Heat limits the CPU and graphics processor in a desktop computer; power limits the battery life of laptop computers, PDAs, and cell phones; and large computing companies such as Google and e-bay are limited airconditioning for their warehouses full of computers.  Parallelism is the most promising solution.  The physics of the transistors that make the chips work mean that if a task can be divided between multiple CPUs, the total energy can be much less than if the task were done on a single CPU.  This is why every computer manufacturer is coming out with multi-core processors.



To make effective use of parallel processors, programmers need to understand the trade-offs of parallel algorithms.  While there have been many models proposed for parallel computation, we are aware of none that take into account the fundamental trade-off between energy and time described above.  We have started looking at this problem and have found some surprising results.  For example, we can show examples of parallel algorithms that perform more operations but use less time and energy than their sequential counterparts.



We propose to develop this theory of energy aware algorithm design.  We will look at how it applies to large-scale computational problems from biology and web-searching.  We will also connect this with our ongoing research into integrated circuit design.  By combining theoretical modeling with practical design, we expect to produce results that are appealing to the theoreticians and useful to computer system designers.

"The Paleogene - from 65 to 24 million years ago (Ma) - was a geological interval of substantial climate change and consequent evolution of both plant communities and the various species that they were composed of. Paleogene climate change was driven by a number of factors, including natural changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. In western North America, over the Paleogene plant communities shifted from predominantly subtropical forest types to a mix of temperate forests more typical of eastern North America today, and open grasslands. This change was driven largely by a shift from globally warm and wet climates, especially during the Late Paleocene (61-55 Ma) and Early Eocene epochs (55-49 Ma), to cooler and drier climates by the Oligocene epoch (34 Ma) and the formation of ice caps on Antarctica and Greenland by the Oligocene. The research aims to use well preserved fossil sites in western Canada, principally from British Columbia, to reconstruct climates and forest ecosystems from the acme of warm climates during the Paleogene, the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO). During the Paleocene and Early Eocene epochs numerous lines of evidence have reconstructed atmospheric CO2 levels 2x to 5x present day levels, but uncertainty remains over the role CO2 played in warming EECO climates. The BC fossil sites preserve a diverse suite of the leaves of many of the trees and other plants that are today typical of the deciduous forests of eastern North America, and especially so the warmer southeast (e.g. palms), together with plant types such as the Chinese rubber tree (Eucommia sp.) and the dawn redwood (Metasequoia sp.), that are found today in southeast Asia. Also present are suites of insects exhibiting a diversity otherwise expected in a tropical setting. The BC Eocene fossil sites provide a natural laboratory to look at how ecosystems have responded to climate change in the past, as well as exploring questions about the evolution of the deciduous forests and the origins of tropical forest diversity.

"The controlled suicide, or programmed death, of particular cells and tissues is a natural part of development in most multicellular organisms. In plants, the formation of the water conducting tissue, the ""wood"" in trees,  is absolutely dependent on the programmed death of the cells that will be directly involved in water conduction. The process is also important in the formation of supportive tissues, the protective bark of trees, and in the response of plants to pathogen invasion. Senescence, the processes leading to leaf fall in autumn is also a consequence of programmed cell death. How the process is controlled in plants, however, is not fully understood. We are investigating the role of a group of particular enzymes involved in separate occurrences of programmed cell in various plants, using tomato as our model system. The various protein digesting enzymes have key roles in  both early and late stages of the death process. Understanding of how the cells and the plant control where and when the enzymes appear and how they are activated should allow us to gain a more complete understanding of the entire program controlling the plant cell death process.

     One of the enzymes that we have found in tomato is common to the death of nutritive cells in the germinating seed and to the death of cells that allows for release of pollen from the flowers.  This enzyme works late in the program. A second and a third enzyme we have isolated both seem to work earlier in the death program, but all are common to a number of cell death events.  In each case there is only one copy of the gene coding for the enzyme, so all of them seem to be extremely important to the plant. Very similar enzymes exist in very distantly related pea and castor bean plant. Our continued experiments will attempt to determine just how important these, and related enzymes, are in the life of the plant.   Future implications of the research would be to fine tune the timing of events involving programmed cell, such as fruit drop, plant senescence during seed filling, fruit ripening, wood formation, etc., to assist in harvest, improve crop yield, extend fruit shelf-life and improve wood production and quality.

"The use of yeast in biotechnology is a multi-billion dollar industry. Their use ranges from the production of foodstuff (beer, wine, bread) to the production of bioactive proteins and complex molecules that are used as drugs and additives. A major problem associated with these uses is that yeast cells must be exposed to a variety of environmental stresses that lead to death and serve to increase costs or decrease end product production. We have identified a number of human, mouse and yeast genes that can confer resistance and prevent cell death in response to different death inducing stimuli. We have used stimuli that mimic the stresses encountered by industrial yeast. Thus our research is of importance because it is in line with many industries that are seeking different ways, including increasing apoptosis resistance, to prevent industrial cell death. In addition, our research is part of a major focus on using yeast as a genetic model to uncover the basic cellular machinery involved in regulating the process of programmed cell death in eukaryotic cells. Genetically encoded cell death is a basic cellular process seen in all eukaryotes and understanding its underlying processes will have wide ranging implications for a variety of processes such as development. Yeast is likely to give new insights into this phenomenon since we can use genetic techniques that are not easily applicable to many other organisms.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Cell Biology"
"Computer systems that personalize their actions in reaction to personal preferences or requirements of human users do so by building profiles of the users. These profiles are based on knowledge gained either from analysis of user interactions with the system or from outside data sources. In either circumstance, there is a potential threat to user privacy. Research by me and others has been devoted to providing personalization support while preserving user privacy. One key approach has been to separate the system's knowledge of the personal identity of the user from the behaviour that is being monitored. This can be achieved by providing a pseudonym for the user and associating behaviour information with the pseudonymous identity. But pseudonymity introduces both social and technical challenges for personalization systems.

  In computer-based learning environments, preserving learner privacy is important in situations where the release of personal information may result in inappropriate stereotypes or discrimination, potential harassment by other learners, or academic dishonesty through identity theft. There is a trade off between protecting learner

privacy and gaining necessary and sufficient knowledge for a learning support system to work effectively. In larger learning communities where personal trust relationships may be less pervasive (and

sometimes ill-advised), a mechanism for protecting user privacy and gauging trust in others is needed. Methods of pseudo-identity can be successfully applied here. For many learners, particularly children, greater

automated protection is appropriate. Methods to identify and curb risky behaviour on the part of learners are needed.

  Techniques for protecting privacy and modelling trust (appropriate for the learning domain) will be investigated in my research. This includes developing secure and reliable models for privacy-enhanced personalization through identity management, models for private reputation transfer from one pseudonymous identity to another, and models for managing multiple identities associated with a single learner.

"Are there benefits to offering  performance guarantees to users when they  use the Internet? And if so, can customers take advantage of this and are they willing  to pay a premium for such facilities? Is it possible to move away from a model of pay-per-service and pay-for-more-bandwidth? 



In earlier research, we have demonstrated that it is possible for users in a  corporate environment to control their quality of experience by  assigning their applications, such as Internet Explorer or telephony, to specific classes of services, such as gold, silver and bronze. A limited budget was the constraint used to force the users to control their consumption and  change classes whenever situations of congestion naturally developed in the network. 



In this project, under the inspiration of our industrial partner, we want to transpose these issues to the general  public and to the new converged service infrastructures, such as IP/TV and Triple Play. In this case, the users' budget constraint is their own, and the satisfaction criteria is their quality of experience.  We will investigate what technology is needed to allow users to express  their choices but also to relate them to  new service environments currently being deployed by network operators.

 

This research could have a significant impact on the way services are offered on the Internet. It will give customers much better control of their expenses by allowing them to pay extra only when they see an immediate improvement in service.   It will also provide more  price/offer selection points for operators.  It could also bring more revenues from their infrastructures without  having to systematically over-dimension their network in the current ""my highway has more lanes than yours"" race.

"As users of the Internet, we have come to expect to receive a large range of services for a flat rate, and to have an ever widening ``data pipe'' allowing us to transfer bigger movies faster. Whether or not such a model makes business sense or theoretical sense is not our point. Rather, we consider that there are still occasions when we will reach the limit of the capacity of the network, if not in the access, then further inside the networks. In such a case, a differentiated-services model can be useful to help more performance-critical applications, but which are the critical applications, and how can they be recognized without breaking the Internet model and giving the ISP control over our environment.

In this project we pursue an investigation on the user control of service classes for end-to-end services in the Internet. We plan to demonstrate the soundness of such a model to deliver large-scale user satisfaction for generic Internet access, but also its usefulness for the operator as it offers a model for consumption-based revenues.

This model is unique as it preserves the freedom of choice of the user to choose and deploy applications, while yet allowing the ISP to help the user with a service differentiation, and minimizes exchanges between the two.","Communication systems and services (planning, organization, services)","Computing and Information Sciences - A"

industrial communities.  These include graph theory, combinatorial designs and coding theory.  Graph

theory is used by managers for time scheduling, by computer scientists for the design of machine

architectures and networks, and by chemists for molecular models.  Combinatorial designs are used to

design statistical tests for effectiveness of new products such as drugs, insecticides and plant

varieties.  Coding theory is used for efficient storage and transmission of digital data as in, for

"My research focuses on life-history variation, population ecology, and behavioural ecology of squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes).  I propose four projects: (1) Individual animals vary in traits (e.g. size) that affect their likelihood of survival and reproduction.  Here, I ask which traits most influence an animal's lifetime reproductive success.  I also ask which components of a species' life history (e.g. adult survival, birth rate) have the greatest effect on its population growth rate. (2) Laboratory studies suggest that females in better condition when they mate give birth earlier.  We will test this effect in free-ranging snakes in the field and determine the mechanisms involved.  We also ask whether there are advantages to earlier birth (better survival of offspring, more frequent reproduction of mother). (3) Animals frequently have injuries, suggesting that they have survived an encounter with a predator.  However, do predator-induced injuries have delayed negative effects (e.g. reduced growth, reproduction, or survival)?  Does the incidence of injury vary with anti-predator traits (e.g. camouflage)?  Can we detect survival differences between different anti-predator traits? (4) In egg-laying species, the female's pre-laying body temperature presumably is important for development of offspring.  If so, do egg-laying females in cool climates retain eggs for longer to gain additional advantages from the female's own body temperature regulation?  Alternatively, how selective are females about temperatures of nest sites?  Could availability of suitable nest sites limit where egg-laying species can live?  

I use both field and laboratory methods, including: mark-recapture analysis (1, 2, 3); population matrix analysis (1); radio-tracking (2, 4); temperature-sensitive radio-telemetry (2, 4); experimental manipulation of temperature regimes (2, 4); and spectrophotometric analysis of colour patterns of animals and their backgrounds (3).   This work will contribute significantly to our understanding of tradeoffs in life-history traits and behaviour and how they influence population dynamics, which in turn has application to conservation.

"Protein coding sequences in the human genome number only ~25,000 and constitute less than 2% of the total DNA content.  The biological significance of the vast non-coding majority of the genome has remained enigmatic.  Today, major initiatives involving sequence comparisons (e.g., ENCODE) are underway to determine whether and in what way portions of so-called ""junk DNA"" may be functional in regulatory or other capacities.  More broadly, it has been known for more than 50 years that total genomic DNA content is non-neutral with respect to organism phenotypes.  Indeed, genome size has been reported to correlate with a variety of traits in animals and plants, including body size, metabolic rate, and developmental rate.  These relationships are thought to derive from causal links between genome size, cell size, and cell division rate, but to date this has not been addressed in detail.  The research proposed here will bring modern technologies to bear on this long-standing question, and will focus on three different but interrelated study systems.  The first involves comparisons of genome sizes and cell sizes from a diverse array of tissues and taxa in order to assess the universality of the genome size-cell size relationship.  This will be accompanied by experimental work aimed at testing mechanistic hypotheses linking genome size to cell size via influences on cell cycle regulation.  The second includes a study of vertebrates whose red blood cells contain no nuclei, but among whom the effects of DNA content on cell size persist.  The third will examine the basis and consequences of the massive genome multiplication that occurs within certain arthropod tissues.  In total, these three studies will allow several critical questions in large-scale genomics to be answered for the first time, and will contribute directly to my long-term goal of understanding the origins, characteristics, and biological relevance of non-coding DNA within animal genomes.  This program will generate both data and methods of practical significance to biologists working in a range of biological disciplines, in addition to providing exceptional opportunities for student training.

"Shallow lakes are a pervasive feature in temperate landscapes and hotspots of biological productivity.  Despite the ubiquity of shallow lakes, there has been a bias in limnology to study deep lakes.  Europeans have recognized this disparity and over the past two decades, they have contributed new data about the ecology and paleoecology of shallow lakes in Europe.  However, given the increasing pressures on fresh waters, it is important to obtain data for shallow lakes in North America to determine the extent to which European models will be applicable to this continent.  To address this need, I have initiated a research program that uses both spatial and temporal approaches to resolve patterns of ecological change in shallow lakes.  The crux of the present proposal is to develop new tools for inferring past ecological changes from lake sediment records and apply these tools to quantify the trajectories, timing and magnitude of ecological dynamics in temperate, northeastern North American shallow lakes over the past ~1000 years.  This research will collect and analyze data for a spectrum of paleolimnological indicators (i.e., algal pigments, diatoms, cladocera, chironomids, pollen and macrofossils) to enable ecological changes to be inferred in the broadest context possible.  The results will then be compared with published records from other regions to determine if the ecological dynamics scale with the intensity of land-use and climate variability at a global level or whether responses are more regionally defined.  This knowledge is critical for modeling the response of shallow lakes to future trajectories of environmental change and for developing effective environmental stewardship plans for one of our most precious natural resources - fresh water.

"Theoretical studies on properties of diatomic and polyatomic molecules in excited states or in degenerate ground states are to be performed. Many of the target molecules are of significance in the environment, in life processes, and in industry. 

Bromo alkanes like CHBr3 are found in the atmosphere. They result from natural sources in the oceans. By sunlight they are broken into radicals which eventually react with ozone. Photodissociation pathways of bromo alkanes and related radicals are to be calculated showing energies and products of decomposition. Such findings are useful in modeling reactions involved in the depletion of ozone. 

Molecules having two or more oxygen atoms in close proximity are found in the environment, in industry as catalysts and photocatalysts, in energy related developments (generation of hydrogen from water), and in biochemical processes. While numerous dioxygen compounds are known, there is insufficient understanding of their properties. For example, the formation of peroxo or superoxo structures, as well as their reactions, can often not be predicted. Systematic studies of series of main group and transition metal dioxides are to be performed, noting ground and excited state structures and properties.  

Aldehydes and ketones, characterized by the carbonyl CO group, occur naturally and are widely used in organic chemistry. While some of their electronic spectra have been measured, many are unknown. Often there are difficulties in the interpretationof the spectra. UV-visible spectra of carbonyl and thiocarbonyl compounds are to be calculated, and the effects of Rydberg interactions are to be investigated. 

Molecules in degenerate states, both linear and nonlinear, have nonsymmetric electron density distributions causing certain properties, such as polarizabilities, to differ in the two perpendicular directions. These anisotropies have so far not been studied. They open up possibilities for new, so far unexplored, optical properties.

"Many fields have massive amounts of data -- ranging from log files from web browsers, to telemetry data from equipment, to hospital records. The patterns within this data can be very valuable; eg these patterns may identify which machine needs preventative maintanence, which sites a user may want to visit and which products s/he is likely to purchase, or even identify which patients will respond well to a given treatment. Unfortunately, these patterns may be difficult to extract, due to both the quantity, and complexity, of the data. The field of machine learning (ML) provides many technologies, and tools, for this task. Much of this work involves understanding, developing and using tools that take as input a ""labeled dataset"" of instances (eg, a set of patients, coupled with their respective clinical outcomes), and returns a classifier, which can map novel instances to labels -- eg, to determine whether a patient, with a given microarray, will respond well to some treatment.



I will explore ways to apply ML to topics in bio- and medical-informatics: designing and building automated tools that [1] learn patterns in Magnetic Resonance images of brains that correspond to brain tumors; [2] correlate patterns of a patients genome (including Single Nucleotide Polyomorphisms) with breast cancer and other patient states; [3] learn properties of proteins (eg, general function, subcellular location and appearance within specific metabolic pathways); and [4] relate diseases to metabolomic profiles and microarray data, based respectively on urine/blood samples and biopsies. I will also explore relevant foundational issues, providing analyses that [1] enable us to effectively and efficiently learn and use probabilistic models, like belief nets; [2] help researchers design experiments more cost-effectively, by determining which tests to run on which training subjects, to provide the relevant information; and [3] use bi-clustering techniques to effectively learn patterns in high-dimensional data, such as microarrays and metabolomic profiles.

"Streptococcus suis, a major swine pathogen worldwide, is transmitted via the respiratory route and colonizes the palatine tonsils of pigs. Major infections caused by this pathogen include septicemiae, meningitis and endocarditis. These bacterial infections generate important economic losses to the Canadian swine industry.

"One of the most interesting (and difficult) problems the brain faces in controlling parts of the body such as the arm has to do with compensating for changes in the mechanics and dynamics of motion - both short term changes that arise when we manipulate objects, and long-term effects due to changes in the size and shape of our own bodies. One of the main theoretical concepts that has been proposed to explain this flexibility in motor control is that the brain uses central representations or ""internal models"" of limb dynamics to achieve this compensation. However, little is known about how the brain establishes these internal models or how they are adapted over the course of motor learning.



This proposal requests funds to purchase a custom-made state-of-the-art robotic device specifically designed to alter the mechanical and dynamical behavior of the human limb during reaching movements by applying precise, computer-controlled loads to the shoulder and elbow joints independently. This new device will allow limb dynamics to be experimentally manipulated in specific ways, so that the mechanisms underlying the formation and adaptation of internal models by the motor system may be studied directly.



The KINARM device (Kinesiological Instrument for Normal and Altered Reaching Movements) is a robotic exoskeleton that attaches to a subject's arm using custom-fitted fibreglass cuffs. High performance computer-controlled torque motors are used to apply precise position- or velocity-dependent loads to the shoulder and/or elbow joint during movement. Motor encoders measure the kinematics (positions and velocities) of joint motion and standard link-segment modelling techniques are used to calculate the net muscular torque at each joint.","Advancement of knowledge","Biological Systems and Functions"

"The prevention and clearance of infection and cancer requires a functional immune system with a well integrated immune response. The immune system uses a wide variety of mechanisms to maintain health and understanding how these immune functions are regulated is critical for the development of effective immune therapies and vaccines. We recently identified a novel method of communication among cells in the immune system. This communication occurs through the transfer of cell membranes and integral membrane proteins between immune cells and between cells in other organs and immune cells. This transfer of information occurs by a variety of mechanisms but conditions which result in inflammation, cell death, or cellular stress increases the release of membrane fragments by donor cells. This transfer of cell membranes and proteins can confer novel functions to the recipient immune cells.  Our research focuses specifically on one type of immune cell, the neutrophil, as the recipient of cell membranes and integral membrane proteins. Neutrophils are the first cells recruited to sites of inflammation where there is ample opportunity to acquire membrane proteins being shed from a variety of cells. Neutrophils have an impressive capacity to rapidly acquire membrane proteins from necrotic and apoptotic cells and these acquired proteins can alter neutrophil function. The present research proposal will characterize the roles that neutrophils, which have acquired membranes from other cells, can play in regulating the development of immune responses. The mechanisms neutrophils use to transfer acquired information to other immune cells and regulate their responses will be determined. Understanding the regulation of immune responses by neutrophils will have direct application to improving vaccine design and may reveal novel strategies for the control of acute and chronic inflammation.

"The era of widespread use of conventional chemical pesticides has ended. Public concern over continued and growing use of toxic pesticides has prompted regulatory agencies to eliminate pesticides or restrict their use.  This, in turn, has lead to the resurgence of many pests, while others continue their assault on food, fiber and people, severely affecting our health and natural resource-based economy. Improved pest control methods and alternatives to chemical pesticides are urgently needed. The renewal proposal of the Industrial Research Chair is about some of those alternatives: multimodal foraging cues or communication signals insects (and some vertebrates) utilize to locate resources and to communicate among themselves. The emphasis is on the discovery of complex, multimodal and multicomponent stimuli because increasing evidence indicates that animals integrate diverse types of information. The discovery of novel visual, semiochemical, sonic, infrared, biomagnetic, and electrostatic foraging cues and communication signals, and synergistic effects between them, would allow the production of more effective baits or repellents, and would facilitate the development of new tactics for target-specific pest control, thereby: (1) improving human health through management of disease-vectoring insects and through reduced exposure to toxic insecticides; (2) improving food quality through elimination of insecticide residue; (3) increasing crop yield and grade through reduced pest impact; (4) reducing costs for pest control through integrated tactics; and (5) preserving biodiversity through conservation of beneficial insects.

"RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections in the cornea has an incidence

of up to 500,000 cases each year in the US alone. Once infected, the virus becomes latent and remains within

the cornea and nerves. When reactivated (by a range of triggers including certains foods, sunlight, surgery), the

patient will have recurrences of the disease. The disease leads to ulceration of the corneal surface to deeper

ullcerations, loss of nerve sensitivity leading to scarring and corneal blindness or even corneal perforation.

Patients are treated with systemic anti-viral drugs but corneal transplantation is the treatment of choice to

restore vision, even though the prognosis is extremely poor - 22% success over 5 years. The poor prognosis is

due to the HSV latency and reactivation. An effective treatment is therefore needed.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective therefore is to develop an effective treatment, using tissue engineering and

photochemistry approaches.

PROPOSED RESEARCH:

We will combine our previous success in developing artificial corneas that have allowed corneal cell and nerve

regeneration when implanted into pigs with new ways to delivery anti-viral drugs such as acyclovir. Novel

photocages will be developed for precise, controlled release of acyclovir, and incorporated into corneal

implants to release the drug during surgery to prevent HSV reactivation.We will also be testing the efficacy of

anti-viral peptides, e.g. LL-37, in combating primary HSV infection and/or preventing viral reactivation.

EXPECTED SIGNIFICANCE

Our results could become a means by which drugs can be delivered to the eye (not just the cornea) and released

bio-photonically. This would allow for high risk corneal transplants and transplants to the retina and other

internal parts of the eye where drugs or growth factors need to be delivered and activated over time, without the

use of invasive techniques like injection.","Medical and health sciences","Collaborative Health Research Projects Selection Panel"

"Milk and dairy products continue to play a significant role in the diets of Canadians, and there is increasing evidence that consumption of such products promote gut health. The proposed research aims at a better understanding of the beneficial effect of delivery systems and functional molecules in our gastro-intestinal tract, with particular focus on dairy systems. It is becoming increasingly recognized that food structure and the processing changes (i.e. fermentation, heat, homogenization) are key to ensure that the functionality of the ingredients is amplified and the molecules retain the wanted activity during passage through the gastrointestinal tract. The proposed research aims at studying the mechanisms by which dairy components are converted in the gut to molecules that confer health benefits. A better understanding of these mechanisms will result in the development of dairy systems with optimal bioactivity during gastrointestinal transit and development of methods to manipulate the gut microbiota through the consumption of dairy products and their components. However, before such products can be developed much more information is required to support any health claims. This proposal seeks to provide such information, by demonstrating targeted delivery of active components.  We are proposing to use a complex multistage continuous culture system (simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem, SHIME) to simulate gut activity and understand the dynamics of the interactions between the food matrix, the bioactive molecules present or formed during digestion, and the gut microbiota. The SHIME will also be used to study the interactions between bioactive, prophylactic or therapeutic molecules present in dairy matrices with enteric, pathogenic bacteria.","Manufacturing processes and products","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"
"It has been estimated that dairy products contribute 9% of total calories to the U.S. food supply and that these dairy foods supply Americans with significant amounts of minerals (73% of calcium, 33% of phosphorus, 16% of magnesium), vitamins (17% of vitamin A, 6% of vitamin Bl, 31% of vitamin B2,10% of vitamin B6, 21% of vitamin B12) and 19% of protein. Milk and dairy products also continue to play a significant role in the diets of Canadians and their safety and quality need to be assured. There are also indications that the consumption of dairy products is influenced by perceived health effects. This is illustrated by the trend towards consumption of low fat products as people have become concerned about the ""obesity pandemic"". It is important that the dairy industry in Canada remain cognizant of the health benefits and impacts of the products that they produce and to actively pursue the introduction of novel, ""healthy"" and safe dairy foods so that it can remain competitive in an increasingly global marketplace. The research outlined in this proposal is aimed at fulfilling these goals. To achieve this objective, a program of research aimed at providing industry with i) an insight into the mechanisms whereby spoilage and pathogenic organisms survive in dairy products and adapt to farm/dairy plant environments; ii) the tools for their detection; iii) the means for their elimination; and iv) novel products produced using food grade microorganisms are proposed.","Processed food products and beverages",University/Industry

"The genes of all higher organisms are packaged with special proteins into a complex structure called chromatin. While every cell contains the same set of genes, each tissue type expresses a specific suite of genes, which gives that tissue its unique identity. Thus, some genes must be expressed while others are silenced. The first level of gene regulation occurs via alterations in the chromatin architecture surrounding a gene, the chromatin domain. A chromatin domain exists either in an 'open'  or a 'closed' state, thus enabling or silencing gene expression, respectively. This phenomenon is called epigenetic regulation and it has been the subject of intense study for the past decade. Understanding epigenetic regulation is essential for understanding normal developmental processes and it is absolutely critical to understanding disease states, such as cancer.

    Our lab was one of the first to develop a method for identifying chromatin proteins. Many labs, worldwide, now work on how these proteins function and the mechanism by which chromatin is remodeled to create a 'closed' vs. 'open' domain. The chromatin proteins are very highly conserved and their function in humans is nearly identical to that in model organisms. Each lab has been working on its favorite protein in its favorite organism. While this is the normal course of scientific study, it has led to some contradictions about the precise role of these chromatin proteins. We are now in a position to unify these findings by studying all the known silencing proteins at a single locus, the histone gene complex (HIS-C) in Drosophila. Our previous studies have shown that all proteins are present at HIS-C and have allowed us to collect all of the tools (mutations, genetic strains, antibodies, etc.) and various assay technologies needed to conduct a these analyses. We will define the order of action of the proteins, their precise function in remodeling the chromatin architecture, and show how mutations in the genes that encode these chromatin proteins alter gene expression. Our findings are fundamental to understanding of the control of normal development processes, and have important consequences for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including cancer.

"Proteins and messenger RNA carry out their biological functions in the cell as macromolecules with a repertoire of structures available and with their stability depending on physiological and environmental conditions. Sequencing and structural data accumulated in public databases wait to be explored systematically to infer the factors of macromolecular dynamics and to generate new, experimentally testable hypotheses on protein and messenger RNA dynamics. The proposed research utilizes several modes of computational and high-throughput biology to discover novel determinants of transcript stabilities in the expressed genome of eukaryotic species, including humans. Messenger transcript stabilities are an important factor in gene regulation: Because transcripts have different binding affinities for interacting proteins, their lifetime and therefore availability for protein synthesis depends on the presence of sequence motifs and their presentation as either single-strand or base-paired local structures. The proposed research will capitalize on previous microarray-based research on the processing and stability of both coding and non-coding RNA and launch a comprehensive computational and systems biology investigation of sequence and structure motifs in the untranslated regions of messenger RNAs and their statistical associations with transcript fate in terms of lifetime, affinity to RNA-binding proteins and cytoplasmic localization. Generically, through the study of yeast as a model organism, and for gene regulation in two selected focal areas: immunology and oxidative metabolism, the research will include experimental collaborations and is expected to lead to new insights in posttranscriptional gene regulation with applications in basic biology, RNA-based biotechnology and RNAi-based gene therapy.

"The  proposed research, primarily in the area of elementary particle physics with emphasis on string theory  will help in the effort to understand how the physical world, at its most basic constituents, functions. String theory is believed to provide answers to many of the questions that Einstein and many other scientists have puzzled over for at least a century. We need to understand why the elementary particles,  electrons, quarks, etc. have the masses they have, what the forces between them are, and, ultimately, why they are grouped into several families with similar properties.



The specific work to be supported by the grant will use certain concepts and techniques that go by such names as superspace, superfields and supergraphs, to perform calculations that should provide insights and partial results about certain quantum fields (quantities which describe mathematicaly specific particles). This research topic is described under the titles  "" Non-anticommutative supersymmetric field theories"" and  ""String-loop calculations in the GS-Berkovits formalism"".

"A major goal of evolutionary biology and ecology is to identify the determinants of biodiversity.  Since Mendel, genetic inheritance has been identified as a fundamental determinant of biodiversity; inheritance provides the physical basis for Darwin's principle of descent with modification.  Genetic inheritance is a genealogical process, whereby genes present in one generation are descents of genes that were present in past generations.  Recently my colleagues and I discovered that the genealogical process determines, in part, the directions of morphological variation in a population.  Previous models of the genetic basis of morphological variation overlooked genealogy, they had focused on mutation, allele frequencies and selection.



The generation of biodiversity is dependent on the presence of genetically based morphological variation and natural selection.  My long-term goal is to fully understand the consequence of genetic inheritance, particularly genealogical structure, on biodiversity.  I will do this by developing genealogical models of morphological evolution.  The genealogical approach is novel and has lead to new predictions about the structure of morphological variation that are consistent with previously published empirical results.



Biodiversity is inherently multivariate, in that individuals and species typically differ in more than one morphological feature.  A complete understanding of biodiversity requires multivariate models of the mutational process.  Multivariate statistical models of mutation are useful, but fail to predict how variation emerges from the processes of development and physiology.  In this grant, I begin to develop calcium signalling as a model system for understanding the origin of multivariate diversity via mutation. In the future I will integrate genealogical models and mutational models to develop unique predictions about the evolution of multivariate biodiversity.

"The development of high performance materials, nanotechnology and biological and biomedical applications require knowledge of the relationship between microscopic (on the nanoscale) morphology and overall (macroscopic) thermodynamic, flow, and mechanical properties. The objective of this project is to provide such knowledge by developing an original multiscale modeling. I have introduced a general framework for this type of modeling in 1984. I have also organized the first International Workshop on Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics on which the framework was discussed (IWNET 1996 in Montreal). The fifth IWNET will take place next year in Mexico.  The framework, known as thermodynamic (GENERIC) framework, is now widely used in modeling rheological and thermodynamic properties of complex fluids (like nanoparticle suspensions, immiscible blends, suspensions of membranes etc.). The novelty (and also the power) of the new approach lies in adding to the requirement of the conservation laws (giving the basis to classical hydrodynamics) two other requirements: (i) compatibility with thermodynamics, and (ii) compatibility with mechanics .  One of the main advantages of the thermodynamic framework is that it can be used for any set of state variables, notably then for both nanoscale and macroscopic state variables and also for their combinations (which then lead to multilevel models).  In terms of the proposed project I intend to continue to develop both the fundamental aspects and applications of the framework. In particular, I am proposing to develop a rheological model of human blood allowing to recognize pathological red cells from r4sults of rheological measurements. Also, results of this project will contribute to nanotechnology, in particular then to processing of polymer layered silicate nanocomposites and other nanoparticle composites.","Materials sciences","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng."
"There are three parts to the proposed research: the first is a study of sapphire and ruby occurrences in Canada, the second is a continuation of my work on granitic pegmatites in the Canadian Cordillera, and the third is a continuation of my research on the crystal chemistry of the borosilicate minerals.

   Ruby is the red gem variety of the mineral corundum; sapphire is any other colour of corundum. In 2002 blue sapphire was discovered near Kimmirut on Baffin Island, and in 2005 pink sapphire and ruby were discovered near Revelstoke in British Columbia. The purposes of the proposed project are to more completely characterize the mineralization at these occurrences, to develop genetic models, and to develop exploration guidelines. The project is significant because it will add to our knowledge of how these deposits form and aid in exploration.

   I propose to continue and expand my research on rare element-bearing pegmatites in the Canadian Cordillera by studying the origin of the Little Nahanni Pegmatite Group (in the NWT), the newly discovered Rau Pegmatite Group (in the Yukon Territory), and pegmatites in southeastern British Columbia. This study is important because these rocks are important sources of strategic metals such as Li, Cs, and especially Ta, which is essential for the production of solid-state capacitors.

   I intend to continue my research on the crystal chemistry of the borosilicates by studying minerals of the dumortierite group. The proposed research has a significance beyond crystal chemistry because B plays an important role in the evolution of geological systems via its influence on transport processes, and the occurrence of borosilicate minerals provides information on the behavior of B during these processes. Dumortierite-group minerals are used in the manufacture of high-grade ceramics and are related to a large group of synthetic microporous compounds with infinite channels up to ca. 4 � that potentially have commercial applications.

"The objective of the proposed investigation is  (i) to provide an experimental data base for  heat transfer enhancement downstream of flow obstacles, (ii)  to compare the data base with current heat transfer prediction methods, and (iii) to present an improved  prediction method.



Properly designed turbulence-promoting flow obstacles can enhance the  downstream heat transfer significantly.  Very few experimental studies  have been performed that actually measure the heat transfer enhancement due to obstacles in single phase flow; these heat transfer experiments covered only a narrow range of obstacle shapes and test conditions. The general assumption is that the heat transfer enhancement follows the law of Yao and Hochreiter (1982) which states that Nu = Nuo (1+A exp{-B z/Dhy}where where Nu is the Nusselt number for the obstacle-equipped channel, Nuo is the Nusselt number for the reference channel without any obstacles, A and B are geometry-dependent correlating constants, z is the axial distance downstream from the spacer, and Dhy is the hydraulic-equivalent diameter.  



Knowledge of the obstacle effect is of considerable practical importance since flow obstacles such as grids and spacers plates are used  in all nuclear fuel bundles and are used as supports heat exchanger and boiler tubes.  



It is proposed to investigate the impact of the following parameters on heat transfer enhancement caused by obstacles: (i)  various shapes of the leading and trailing edges, (ii) flow blockage ratios,  (iii) Reynolds numbers and (iv) Prandtl numbers and (v) distance from the flow obstacle, (vi) number of flow obstacle in series. The tests will be performed in  a directly heated test section,  equipped with various thermocouples along its length.  In order to maintain the same conditions at the measuring station except the distance from the flow obstruction, a unique experimental approach will be used:  the obstacle will be moved  non-intrusively using strong ceramic magnets  located outside the (non-magnetic) Inconel test section. 



The impact on pressure drop will also be measured.  In the analysis the relationship between pressure drop and heat transfer enhancement will be investigated. The possibility of  introducing a figure of merit, i.e.  expressing the optimum enhancement in terms of minimum increase in pressure drop will be  examined as well.

"Through human population growth, technology and consumption, Earth's ecosystems are modified to the extent that altered environments are the predominant habitat for biodiversity.  Evolutionary ecology should therefore move beyond the study of biodiversity in its natural settings to understanding its evolutionary trajectories in human-altered environments.  Establishing how evolution contributes to the success or failure of biodiversity in novel habitats expands our understanding of the potential for life to respond to anthropogenic influence.  Our long-term objective is a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary and ecological processes underlying adaptation and colonization, as illuminated by salmon.  Perhaps more than any other vertebrate taxa, salmonid fishes have been translocated to many regions of the world where they experience natural selection in novel environments.  In addition, salmon are produced both within and outside their range, by artificial propagation centers or hatcheries to meet the dual roles of production and conservation.  By building on twenty-five years of research on salmon, including in their natural environment, we will now examine their evolution and ecology in human-altered environments:  natural range with propagation, exotic range with propagation, and exotic range without propagation.  Specifically, through field and lab studies in all three altered environments, we will: (1) quantify selection and the resulting fitness consequences to the population; (2) determine which processes either promote or discourage successful adaptation, and (3) characterize the potential for further evolution of biodiversity. Results from these three different types of human-altered environments will reveal the potential for divergence and expose the evolutionary and ecological processes at play.  This will provide an advanced understanding of how biodiversity evolves in human-altered environments, and offer greatly improved control over wildlife through management.  Thus the research will have both pure (discovery) and applied (conservation and exploitation) applications.   We will train highly qualified personnel for research and its application to wildlife, and generate publications of high relevance to the disciplines of evolution and ecology.  Because we are working with salmon, our research is economically important to Canadians and our students are certain to be in demand in private, government and academic sectors.","Wildlife management","Evolution & Ecology"

"With fossil fuel based power generators being phased out because of environmental concerns, nuclear energy is once again a serious alternative.  Although the power generated by nuclear reactors is considered ""clean"", hazardous radioactive waste is produced.  Canada supplies >25% of the worlds' uranium (U) supply (production value > $2.5 billion), with much of it destined for nuclear power facilities.  To increase Canada's position in the U market, it is important to develop materials for use in the storage of nuclear waste.  The long-term goal of the research program initiated by the Grosvenor group is the development of ordered compounds that can sequester U in the structure and resist radiation induced structure damage.  To initiate this research, model compounds representing host materials will be examined first in order to gain a clear understanding of the relationship between crystal structure, composition, bonding, electronic structure, and surface reactivity to the sequestration of actinides like U.  Of particular interest is the examination of the high temperature oxidation of possible host materials under various conditions.  Part of this RTI grant will be used to purchase a high temperature tube furnace to oxidize materials having the zircon (ASiO4; A=Zr, Hf), and skutterudite (REM4Pn12; rare-earth (RE)=La, Ce, Eu, Gd; M = Fe, Co; Pn (pnictide)=P, As, Sb, Bi) structures.  The tube furnace will be able to heat materials to temperatures as high as 1700C for extended periods of time and will allow for the experiments to be performed in a controlled environment.  The electronic structure and oxidation behaviour of the materials to be synthesized will be investigated by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, utilizing synchrotron radiation.  The rare-earths, pnictides, and actinides used to produce the materials to be studied are air sensitive.  To produce pure materials, it is best to manipulate and store these elements in a glovebox.  Further, for safety reasons, manipulation of radioactive materials in a glovebox that can operate under either a positive or negative pressure is preferred.

"Summary  Groth 



A principal goal of the proposed research is to develop and use numerical methods, modelling, and simulation tools for enhancing the understanding of injection, mixing, and combustion processes occurring in hybrid rocket motors with liquid oxygen (LOX) injection under conditions of very high pressure. This enhanced understanding and resulting computational tools will be subsequently used to analyse, assess, and improve upon the design of the LOX injection system and combustion chamber in staged-combustion aft-injected hybrid (SCAIH) rocket motors. Both two-dimensional axisymmetric and fully three-dimensional multi-phase flow computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models will be developed for the treatment of LOX oxidizer stream breakup and atomization, droplet formation and evaporation, as well as the subsequent mixing and combustion with propellant gases arising from the burning and pyrolysis of fuel-rich solid propellant. A parallel implicit, block-based adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), finite-volume scheme will be used to solve the Favre-averaged conservation equations governing the fully turbulent, two-phase flow and combustion of the LOX and fuel streams. The Peng-Robinson equation of state will be used to represent the thermodynamic behaviour of oxygen near the critical point and both equilibrium and non-equilibrium models will be used to model LOX vaporization under subcritical conditions. Simplified modelling for particulates and soot and radiative heat transfer will also be developed and incorporated. As part of the proposed research, a sub-scale SCAIH rocket motor will be designed, built, and tested and the resulting experimental data will serve as a final validation for the numerical modelling. SCAIH rocket motors are a potentially very promising technology for the propulsion of small, dedicated, launch vehicles for micro-satellite payloads. There is currently an opportunity for significant growth in the small launcher arena with potential micro-satellite customers coming from both the private and defence sectors. The proposed project has the potential to help bring the SCAIH rocket motor technology to the market place and make Canada a world leader within the small launch vehicle business.

"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has proven to be an important enabling technology in many areas of science and engineering.  In spite of the relative maturity and widespread successes of CFD, there remain a variety of physically-complex flows, which are still not well understood and have proven to be very challenging to predict by numerical methods (e.g., turbulent and reactive flows and non-equilibrium micro-scale flows).  Along with CFD algorithm development, the rapid increase in high-performance computing systems in the last 10-15 years has lead to terascale and, very recently, petascale parallel systems, ranging in size from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands of cores.  These advances in computing hardware are, in turn, creating significant opportunities for CFD of physically-complex flows.   Nevertheless, significant advances in numerical methods are required to fully exploit current and future computing platforms and thereby enable the more routine solution of physically-complex flows for practical engineering applications.  The proposed research will focus on the development of novel parallel high-order finite-volume and hybrid adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes for predicting physically-complex flows using parallel and new emerging computational architectures.  Key elements of the research will include: (i) development of AMR and embedded mesh strategies for treatment of complex geometries and interfaces using hybrid (structure and unstructured) multi-block meshes; (ii) development of anisotropic mesh refinement techniques based on dual-weighted reconstruction and residual error estimates; (iii) design of efficient and scalable, two-level, coarse-fine-grain parallel methods for effective use of multi-core systems and floating-point accelerators; (iv) development of improved parallel implicit time-marching methods; and (v) enhancements of high-order finite-volume spatial discretization procedures for improved solution accuracy.  The potential and performance of the proposed methodology will be demonstrated through application to the prediction of turbulent reactive flows, as well as non-equilibrium micro-channel flows.

"In thermal/energy engineering, solid-liquid phase change processes are encountered in a wide variety of application areas such as the energy, solar, environmental, space and metallurgical industries.  The objectives of this research proposal are to perform experimental studies and to develop theories on solid-liquid phase change processes, as well as to develop novel energy saving and conversion systems through applications such as latent heat energy storage systems, thermal insulation and laser drilling. 

  

This is an important experimental and theoretical research area because proper understanding of these processes and the application to energy and thermal systems will facilitate the management of energy demand, use and production, as well as the known environmental consequences associated with it.  For example, phase change latent heat storage systems can be used to store thermal energy during off-peak electricity demand periods, reducing the amount of electricity produced to meet the demand during peak periods; similar storage systems can be used to store solar energy in order to use it later in the day when the sun is down.  As another example, better understanding of melting and solidification in metallurgical processes could also reduce the amount of energy used by this industry.



The main challenge of this research program has to do with understanding and modeling the heat transfer and phase change processes encountered in these systems, taking into account the multiple heat transfer modes involved.  Most existing literature on the subject presents studies where only one heat transfer mode is considered, while the others are neglected.  Our country, along with the rest of the world, will face an energy crisis in the decades to come; in that context, research in this area of thermal/energy engineering has the potential to lead to the development of new and vital energy and environmental technologies for Canada.

"More and more non-invasive neuroimaging techniques are now available to study normal brain functions but also brain disorders. However, it does not exist any ideal exploration technique able to measure precisely when (at a ms scale) and where (at a  mm scale) an activity occurred in the brain. Each neuroimaging technique measures  through different mechanisms (neuronal electricity, oxygen consumption) part of brain activity, being sometimes more dedicated to the question ""where?"" (good spatial resolution) or to the question ""when?"" (good temporal resolution). Each of these techniques having its specific advantages and limitations, analyzing each of them individually only provides partial information regarding underlying brain activity. The objective of my research project is to develop methods to appropriately combine these multimodal data, i.e., data fusion methods, in order to detect additional information that could be missed by considering each modality individually. A typical challenge is to combine modalities measuring directly neuronal activity with high temporal resolution with other modalities measuring indirectly the same function with high spatial resolution, through hemodynamic processes for instance. My project will involve the integration of three promising functional modalities: (1) Simultaneous ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) - MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG) acquisitions, measuring directly on the scalp electric and magnetic components of signals generated by neurons synchronously active (at a ms scale). (2) Simultaneous EEG - functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI acquisitions to measure, within the whole brain at a second scale, hemodynamic responses that correlate with signals detected on scalp EEG. (3) Simultaneous EEG - Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) acquisitions to measure local changes in oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin at the time of signals detected on scalp EEG, by exploiting absorption properties of infrared light within brain tissues using optic fibres placed on the surface of the head. The principal clinical application of this project will be to combine these three modalities using multimodal data fusion techniques to characterize brain regions involved during epileptic activity.

"Reconfigurable System-on-Chip Distributed Instrumentation



Distributed instrumentation networks continue to be considered one of the most important technologies for the 21st century. Emergent information-technology Real World Web (as opposed to the virtual World Wide Web), based on Smart Sensor Mesh Networks, has been identified among the first three key areas for the period 2008-2012 by Gartner, Inc. The proposed research, a continuation of the applicant's previous work on distributed virtual instrumentation, aims to improve functionality, versatility, efficiency and robustness of smart sensor networks in remote monitoring applications, while increasing accuracy and adequacy of the acquired data. 

The focus is on intelligent sensors architectures, information harvesting techniques and objective interpretation of acquired data, rather than on communication over the networks. The project is build as a three layer hierarchical architecture encompassing smart SoC sensors at the lower level to performing signal acquisition and pre-processing functions, a middle layer for information processing, and an upper layer for knowledge extraction and complexity management. The reconfigurable sensing SoC will be capable to fusing data from orthogonal algorithms, adapting its quantization and sampling parameters to the dynamics of the monitored signals, HW reconfiguration to adapt algorithms with the acquired signals characteristics, self-testing, self-calibrating and validating acquired data.

"Tapping into the methane gas locked in hydrate form could potentially double the world's energy reserves,

while producing less harmful emissions than conventional energy sources. Gas hydrates are solid crystalline

compounds that encage gas molecules inside the lattices of hydrogen bonded water molecules. Although

hydrates appear similar to ice, they will release over 160 volumes of methane gas for each volume of hydrate

when exposed to atmospheric conditions. Early indications from production tests in the Canadian Arctic show

that a significant amount of gas can be viably produced from hydrates. Canada is the third largest exporter of

natural gas and, along with increasing domestic demands, has the opportunity to augment our conventional

reserves (~11 trillion cubic meters) with our staggering resources of gas from hydrate reservoirs (~500 trillion

cubic meters).

This innovative program investigates the relatively unexplored field of gas hydrate-sediment mixtures,

specifically the flow of fluids within this unique system. The objective of the proposed research is to

characterize and assess the effect of permeability on gas production from hydrate reservoirs. Permeability is

important in that gas production rates from hydrate reservoirs is a strong function of permeability of the hydrate

zone; however, current models and measurements suggest a variation of seven orders of magnitude of predicted

permeability for the same hydrate saturation. Our group is approaching the characterization of this important

parameter through an integrated program of experimental and theoretical research, which links micro, meso,

and macro level scales to garner a full understanding of the effects of permeability on the production of natural

gas from hydrate reservoirs. We have adopted a multilevel collaborative approach to solving one piece of the

hydrate recover puzzle which will no doubt contribute to the production of methane gas from hydrates and thus

benefit not only the energy industry but also the general population.

"The dynamical interactions of neurons form the basis of brain function. Neurons synchronize within and between different brain regions to produce rhythmic oscillations that vary during behavior. For instance, cortical high frequency 'gamma' oscillations increase with the difficulty of cognitive tasks in humans. The equipment described in this proposal will enable NSERC-funded researchers at the University of Lethbridge and their collaborators the ability to assess the cellular and network mechanisms that underlie synchronization and encoding of information. In particular, the contributions of the neuromodulator dopamine and inhibitory interneurons will be evaluated in brain slice preparations. This work will complement ongoing work in behaving animals and computational models to provide a cell-to-systems approach for investigating neural dynamics. The outcomes of this type of research hold great promise for advancing our knowledge of the cellular basis of cognitive function. Furthermore, this equipment will provide unique training opportunities as the only in vitro electrophysiology setup at the University of Lethbridge, and will endow highly qualified personnel with a marketable skill desired by laboratories in academic and industrial institutions.

Our long-term goal is to understand the interplay between the regulation of sleep and cognitive development. The objective of this application is to characterize the interplay between sleep regulation and the systems that regulate learning and memory in children and adolescents. The central hypothesis is that sleep is critical for learning and memory in children and adolescents. Our rationale for this study is that successful completion of the proposed research will contribute important insight into the underpinning of learning and memory in children and adolescents. Our contribution is expected to be significant because it is expected to advance our mechanistic understanding of fundamental processes that are critical in the developing brain. We plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish our objectives by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Characterize the Interplay Between Sleep and Learning/Memory in Children and Adolescents; 2) Determine the Relevance of Clock Genes to Individual Differences in the Impact of Sleep on Learning and Memory. This study has several strengths: 1) It is based on an innovative experimental approach; 2) It uses advanced objective methodology that overcomes previous methodological challenges in the field; 3) This will be the first study to examine the role of sleep in memory in adolescents; 4) This will be the first examination of the genetic mechanisms involved in these processes; and, 5) This will be the first study to examine the impact of sleep on memory of emotional vs. neutral information in youth.

"The Earth's geosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere interact in diverse ways at a variety of spatial and temporal scales.  Studying the impacts of climate and erosion on tectonics (the study of the Earth's crust and the forces that influence it) is one of the most active research topics in the geological sciences.  The Himalaya is the archetypal mountain range formed by the collision of continents, and its southern rampart is an exceptional natural laboratory to test the interactions between Earth's interior and surface processes.  For example, the Indian summer monsoon plays an essential role in erosion along the Himalaya and its intensity has varied considerably since it was established some 12 million years ago.  Conversely, the movement of Himalayan tectonic plates has remained fairly steady since collision between India and Eurasia began ~55 million years ago.  As the same rock types are found along the entire 2000 km-wide mountain range, observed changes in surface geology are most likely due to the variation of erosion in space and time.  The formation of the Himalaya is currently explained by two contrasting tectonic models that differ in their predictions for the sequence of deformation along the main structures.  The rationale of this investigation is to provide a comprehensive study of the ages of the main geological structures and erosion rates, as a field-based test of the model predictions.  This will provide crucial information about the coupling of deformation between middle and upper crustal levels and ultimately about the links between deep crustal deformation and surface processes.  Floods, landslides, debris flows and even earthquakes are consequences of the processes that create dynamic landscapes in tectonically-active areas.  Comprehending the rate and variability of such mass transport systems on the Earth's surface and understanding the Earth's response to climate changes over geologic time will lead to better hazard forecasting.  In addition to taking a leadership role in the discipline, Canada will benefit from further understanding of the underlying processes responsible for the Earth's major evolutionary steps that can inform into policy development initiatives regarding geohazard, environmental protection and climate change.

The subject of this investigation involves symmetry reduction methods and geometric methods based on the analysis of surfaces immersed in Lie algebras.

The development of these methods provides us with new tools for dealing with nonlinear phenomena in physics, especially the ones which are described by multidimensional systems of PDEs and which so far have not been approached successfully by other methods.

"Many tasks require correct and meaningful communication and integration among intelligent agents and information resources.  A major barrier to such interoperability is semantic heterogeneity: different applications, databases, and agents may ascribe disparate meanings to the same terms or use distinct terms to convey the same meaning.  



Several standards exist which support interoperability among manufacturing

software systems.  Unfortunately, these standards have many overlapping concepts, and each standard often has a different intended semantics for these concepts; consequently, the standards are difficult to verify by customers, complex to maintain, and costly to harmonize.



It has been recognized that the emerging technology concerned with the development and application of ontologies will play a central role in achieving semantic integration.  An ontology is a computer-interpretable specification that is used by an agent, application, or other  information resource to declare what terms it uses, and what the terms mean.



This project will design ontologies for manufacturing standards, evaluate their logical and mathematical properties of these, and apply them to support the harmonization and integration of the manufacturing standards.

"Nanocomposite coatings are novel materials for enhanced wear protection, hardness, and friction reduction. They have promising applications in automotive and aerospace engines, in cutting tools, and in medical implants.

Their function relies on the fact that smaller and smaller crystallites are difficult to break - in the language of material scientists it is more and more difficult to introduce dislocations into those small crystallites. Nanocomposites are made of nanometer-sized crystallites embedded into an amorphous matrix. The challenge is to prevent the crystallites from sliding and rotating in the matrix. For that purpose they better be not too small. The actual research on nanocomposites strives for an optimization of mechanical properties by finding the best materials and structures.

This study combines the recent developments in material growth and engineering testing with novel methods of nanoscience to achieve those goals. Atomistic simulation, atomic resolution force microscopy, indentation methods, and modeling of the coating structure are integrated into a joint study of nanocomposites of metal nitrides and silicon, aluminum and silicon, and diamond-like carbon.

"Cell volume regulation - the search for a volume sensor



Animal cell volume is an important factor that defines various cellular functions, including cell growth and death, ion transport, and cell metabolism. Cell volume changes in many pathological conditions, such as brain injuries, diabetic complications and other disorders. Cell volume is tightly regulated via activation of membrane transporters and metabolic processes that provide a net loss or gain of intracellular osmolytes. A major gap, however, exists in our knowledge of how cells detect volume perturbations. Identification of the cell volume sensor remains the most significant challenge in the field of cell volume regulation, and progress in this research area is mainly hindered by the lack of appropriate methods to monitor volume changes of single, living cells. Our laboratory has recently invented a novel method which allows imaging single, live cells in 3 dimensions. In the proposed research program we propose to further improve our prototype single-cell volume-monitoring system and apply it to elucidate cell volume-sensing mechanism(s). This research program promises both innovation in single-cell imaging techniques and notable advancement of our understanding of how cells sense changes in their volume. Exploration of these mechanisms is essential for full understanding of a broad range of related cellular processes in normal and pathological conditions. The nature of this research encompassing cell physiology, cell biology, microscopy imaging, chamber design and software development will allow us to  train students in a multidisciplinary manner.

Second, we will design algorithms for processing queries where the quality of the answer rather than its cost is the primary goal.

"Database systems are increasingly used in an interactive mode. Users often have insufficient knowledge of suitable query conditions and end up retrieving too many answers or no answers at all. With no help from a database system, query formulation becomes a trial and error process. This can be a frustrating experience and is indeed quite common; the number of empty answers in one of the genomic databases has been reported to reach 38% of all queries asked in that database.



We propose to develop tools and techniques for cooperative query answering in database systems. Databases satisfy the standard of providing the correct answers, but these are not necessarily the answers the users want. One example of cooperative response is relaxation: if the answer to a user query comes up empty, a database system should ""suggest"" a query similar to the original one, yet with non-empty answer. Another, more advanced, cooperative technique is false presupposition discovery: a user should be informed that the query conditions are inconsistent with the database semantics, hence the query can never return any answers.

"Polymeric nanoparticles represent a promising platform for targeted drug delivery applications. The central challenge in administering polymeric nanoparticles in vivo lies in the rapid particle clearance from the systemic circulation by the liver and spleen. As a result, only a small fraction of the administered nanoparticle dose is able to reach the targeted diseased cells and tissues. The nanoparticle clearance process is initiated when blood plasma proteins bind to the particle surface, making them visible to macrophages. The central aim of the proposed grant is to establish an active research program for developing drug-loaded polymeric nanoparticles that can effectively minimize plasma protein adsorption on the particle surface. It is hypothesized that the rate of nanoparticle clearance by macrophages can be substantially decreased by systemically optimizing the surface properties of polymeric nanoparticles. Our strategy involves modifying particle surfaces with natural polymers that mimic the protein-repelling surface properties of invasive pathogens. In the first phase of the proposed five-year research program, a platform technology will be developed for synthesizing self-assembled polymeric nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery. The second phase of the program will focusing on controlling the nanoparticle physicochemical properties to minimize protein adsorption on the particle surface. The nanoparticles developed from the proposed program may be used for a variety of clinical and biomedical applications. It is generally understood that targeted drug delivery holds great promise in pharmaceutical innovation for its ability to increase the effectiveness of existing drugs, decrease the necessity and thus cost for surgery and hospitalization and increase the quality of life of patients.

The research will relate to the working fluid water at high temperature, which is close to its critical point (221.2 bar, 374.15 C). The fundamental knowledge generated from this research would be directly beneficial to Canadian power-generation and potentially useful to chemical, and oil-gas industries. Short-term applications of the research focus on providing support to the nuclear reactor industry for designing of new reactor types and improving the safety of existing reactors in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. The research utilizes mainly Refrigerant-134a, which is one of the environmentally safe refrigerants, as coolant to simulate the high-pressure steam-water flow.

Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks provide promising infrastructures to meet the information networking demand and have been widely used as backbone networks in the Internet, metropolitan area networks, and high-capacity local area networks. Methodologies and technologies for WDM networks have been becoming key research areas for both academia and industry. To realize communication applications on WDM networks, algorithms are needed to decide light paths for routing and to multiplex low-rate traffic demands in the applications to share the light paths. A general goal in the study of WDM networks is to determine the resources required to achieve a given connectivity as a function of network size and functionality of network nodes. Fundamental optimization problems for this goal are to minimize the resources for realizing a given communication application and to maximize the performance of a network subject to the given resources. It is usually NP-hard to find optimal solutions for those optimization problems. Most previous algorithms for the problems are based on the integer linear programming or ad hoc heuristics and the quality of solutions is not guaranteed. It is extreme importance but challenging to design algorithms which proive solutions with guaranteed quality for those problems. With this proposed project, we use new approaches to develop efficient algorithms with guaranteed performances for the optimization problems. One novel approach to be explored is the tree/branch-decompositions based algorithms. We expect to develop efficient algorithms which provide solutions with much better guaranteed quality for the targeted optimization problems and establish new general approaches for tackling hard optimization problems in networking. The outcome of the research is expected to significantly improve the performances and provide solid foundation for the future design and operation of WDM networks.

"Fiber optic sensor (FOS) has become more and more popular since it can perform unique functions that conventional sensors cannot. For example, an FOS can be embedded inside carbon fiber composite for fatigue tests or embedded in concrete bridges or dams for structural integrity tests. Due to the small size, FOS can be applied to places that are off-limits to other sensors, such as on the computer flip-chip Ball Grid Array substrate for qualification bending test, or on a catheter to measure bending radius. The purposes of this proposal are to develop specific FOSs for many important applications, including: i)FOS arrays for strain and bending measurement of steering artificial muscle catheter; ii)FOS for yield strength and tensile strength of friction stir welding alloy; iii) FOS arrays for detecting crack initiation and propagation of carbon fiber composite materials; and iv) FOS high speed impact test. 

The intended outcome is to develop these sensors to meet the demands from many researchers for advanced material and structure integrity testing. My long-term goal is to embed and integrate FOS into structures to build smart structures.

This research will benefit both academic as well as industrial researchers. For example, sensors installed on catheter can be used to better control direction, and therefore improve medical diagnoses; knowledge of tensile strength of welded alloys, often used in aerospace structures, can be used to improve the welding process; the detection of crack initiation and propagation in carbon fiber composite materials can lead to better evaluation of the service lifetime of the structures; and impact sensor can measure the effects of high speed loads, such as in aircraft landing and take-off.

"How to effectively and economically recover heavy oil from the tremendous heavy oil deposits in Canada is a key technical challenge. Solvent vapour extraction (VAPEX) is an in-situ non-thermal enhanced heavy oil recovery process in which a gaseous solvent is injected from an upper horizontal injection well into a heavy oil reservoir and the solvent-diluted heavy oil is then drained downward by gravity and produced from a lower horizontal production well. The VAPEX process is a promising alternative to the currently used thermal methods for heavy oil recovery, such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). It is an energy-efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally sound heavy oil recovery technology. Also, as thermal methods are not suitable for most Canadian heavy oil reservoirs, VAPEX is even more attractive in the Canadian context. 

     The major objective of this research program is to study the VAPEX heavy oil recovery mechanisms in order to develop some long-sought heavy oil production models. Specifically, this research aims at achieving a new and fundamental understanding of complex mass-transfer processes of the injected solvents under actual heavy oil reservoir conditions. Moreover, some important process-controlling parameters will be thoroughly studied. Finally, several practically applicable heavy oil production models and variations of the VAPEX process will be developed for future commercial applications.

     At present, several large oil companies are conducting a number of field pilots of the VAPEX process and its variations. The proposed research program will focus on the in-situ enhanced heavy oil recovery mechanism studies of the VAPEX process and develop several robust heavy oil production models. Also this study will provide technical assistance in optimization of the ongoing VAPEX pilot projects and design of upcoming future VAPEX field applications. Hence, the petroleum industry will directly benefit from the proposed research and successfully recover more heavy oil. In addition, Canadians will also benefit from the reduced greenhouse gas emissions when the VAPEX heavy oil recovery technology is commercially applied.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng."

"It is well known that ruminants and ruminal microorganisms have a symbiotic relationship which microbial fermentation of ingested feed plays a major role in supplement of energy for metabolic functions in cattle. The rumen of cattle can be considered as an active ""bio-reactor"" producing many unknown bio-products, which are fundamental components for cattle's daily nutrition uptake, production, and health maintenance. Up to date, the understanding of the biological process of microbes in the rumen is insufficient and the linkage between the microbial functions with host's performance, for example, methane production, has not been well understood. Methane gas is the end product of the microbial decomposition of organic matter in the rumen by a group of archaea, the methanogens. It has been estimated that methane production by ruminants is about 15% of total atmospheric emissions. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between the ecology ruminal methanogens and their produced enzymes with the methane production trait of beef cattle. Firstly, the diversity of methanogens in the rumen will be investigated using culture independent methods. Secondly, functions of microbial key genes in the methane biosynthesis will be analyzed by the measurement of their genetic and expression variations. Last, the roles of methanogens and the above key enzymes will be investigated in a group of animals under different diets to elucidate their relationships to the methane production in beef cattle.  The long-term goal of this study is to deliver a research program that can elucidate the associations between the biofunctions of rumen microbes and host phenotypical performance, and to apply the knowledge to improve host's production and health traits.

uncontrolled seizures require considerable health care resources and experience a high number of disability

days leading to unemployment or a low income. Brain surgery is recommended when medication fails and the

seizures are confined to one area of the brain where tissue can be safely removed. To localize the epileptogenic

zone, patients undergo a comprehensive presurgical evaluation which involves clinical tests, the use of various

imaging procedures and video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. When these tests fail, an invasive

study is required where intracranial electrodes are implanted under general anaesthesia. Unfortunately, chronic

implantation of intracranial electrodes carries a risk of infection and haemorrhage.

We propose the development of a non-invasive technique that could reduce the number of cases requiring an

intracranial study prior to surgery, reduce the number of electrodes and optimize their positioning if one is still

needed. The technique is based on combining Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) images with

electroencephalograms (EEGs). EIT produces images of changes in electrical properties of brain tissue. These

images can help localize an epileptogenic zone because blood flow and related changes that occur during

epileptic activity produce significant conductivity variations. Systems for EIT are safe, portable and of

sufficiently low cost to be dedicated to a patient while interfering minimally with current clinical practices. The

new technique should translate into a better surgical outcome.

"Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a medical imaging technique that measures and displays changes in the electrical properties of biological tissues. The properties of body fluids (blood, air in the lungs, gastric content) are different from those of surrounding tissues. Variations in the volume of these fluids within a body section, due to physiological processes (e.g. respiration, circulation, digestive system activity) or pathology can be imaged by EIT. These images can be obtained continuously, in real time, with simple instrumentation placed at the patient's bedside, making EIT a good choice for monitoring applications. One such application is pulmonary monitoring of mechanically ventilated patients in an intensive care context.   

  EIT works by applying low amplitude, high frequency current to an array of electrodes and measuring the voltages that result from the flow of current through body tissues. A computer program transforms those measurements into images. The limited number of electrodes that may be used in practice, and the fact that they can only be placed on the body surface, results in images of low spatial resolution and poor contrast sensitivity to changes that occur deep in the body. 

  We propose to develop a new technique, named ""Multi-Mode EIT"" that could significantly improve the quality of EIT images. The term Multi-Mode refers to the different ways (modes) by which the electrical properties of  tissues can be probed by concurrently applying current with electrodes, and by inducing current with time-varying magnetic fields generated by coils. The outcome of this work will be an image-based patient monitoring methodology that is applicable to a broader range of clinical areas than conventional EIT. For example, the magnetic induction modes of Multi-Mode EIT can overcome the screening effect of highly resistive tissues that surround certain organs (e.g. the lungs surrounding the heart, the skull enclosing the brain ) and make it possible to monitor patients for life threatening conditions such as pulmonary edema or cerebral edema, in a safe and effective way.

       Maintaining the integrity of genetic information is one of the most important processes required for the propagation of life.  DNA mismatch repair maintains genomic stability by correcting mismatches generated during DNA replication and by signaling cell death when DNA repair fails.  MutL plays an essential role in initiation of DNA mismatch repair by coordinating various steps on the repair process.  Inactivation of human MutL proteins causes genomic instability and is associated with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).  Interestingly, the defect on a mismatched DNA arises from the mispair of otherwise two perfectly correct nucleotides.  Hence, it is fundamental to distinguish the copy from the template strands, as the copy is the one that needs repair.  Our laboratory, studies how MutL aids on the discrimination between the old and the new strands using a multidisciplinary approach ranging from cellular to structural biology.  As in all life, so too in science, a picture is worth a thousand words.  Therefore we use X-ray crystallography, a powerful technique that allows us to study three-dimensional structures at atomic resolution, to provide the working frame for our mutational and functional studies.  Our research will clarify the role of MutL at this critical step of the repair process.

"Global market pressures, environmental constraints and energy costs are having a significant impact on the management of companies in many sectors of the Canadian economy including chemical and petrochemical plants. Canadian companies must consider a holistic approach that combines science and technology into business strategies for producing services and products for a dynamic world market. These sudden and drastic changes in management culture have led to the development of alternative strategies that offer the flexibility required to handle economic pressures while reducing emissions and energy costs. Such an integrated approach to decision-making has pushed control engineers to think globally about plant behavior and to consider the full complexity of plant operation. The objective of this project is to develop process control techniques that are suitable for application in complex systems. Complex processes pose a number of technical challenges. They cannot be handled directly by the  engineering tools that are commonly used to solve standard process control problems. In this research program, we will develop techniques to reduce the complexity of large systems by producing simpler descriptions that retain the essential features of complex systems. These simple descriptions provide a manageable platform to design control and monitoring systems for complex dynamic processes. The proposed research program will provide innovative techniques for the synthesis of estimation and control systems that allow the implementation of global objectives of the complex system architecture while providing maximum performance of each of its components. The research program tackles three specific areas of applications that address specific features of complex systems. The first area of application considers fluid flow estimation in building systems and fuel cell systems.  The second area of application considers the design of control architectures suitable for large-scale system control such as chemical plants. The last area of application considers the design of drug delivery control systems.

"Algebra is a branch of mathematics which studies additional structures on sets which are similar to addition and multiplication of  numbers. Such structured sets are also called by the generic name of ""algebras"". Lie algebras are slightly different and resemble spaces of matrices (arrays of numbers).  Those that I am interested in are called ""double affine"":  they are matrices with entries which are polynomials in two variables. Affine algebras and Lie algebras play a central role in mathematical physics and the importance of those of double affine type for this branch of theoretical science has been increasing over the last ten years: thus, some of my work may be of interest to physicists.  



I intend to investigate more the structure and the representations of double affine algebras and Lie algebras. Representations are spaces on which these mathematical objects act and they can be used to understand them better. These spaces can be studied using algebraic, combinatorial and geometric methods. Representations form categories and these can be related to one another via mathematical objects that are called functors. (A functor is a generalization of the notion of function.)  Establishing functors between different categories of representations is always a goal of algebraists.

"Trace metals in the environment can provide either benefits or risks to aquatic life and humans. They may arise naturally or result partly or wholly from man-made pollution. It is no longer adequate, however, to consider only the total metal concentration in order to assess risk/benefit. Rather, it is necessary to determine the physicochemical forms (i.e. speciation) of an element because different forms of the same metal can range from essential to innocuous to strongly toxic. The modeling of metal speciation permits exploration into the processes of mobility, transport, toxicity and bioavailability of metals in water. Its application to natural aquatic ecosystems, however, is often limited due to the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM), the main ligand for metal complexation. It is normally assumed in modeling calculations that all DOMs, regardless of their nature and origin, behave in a similar way toward complex trace metals. The diversity and variability of DOM within a specific environment depend on the potential origins of the DOM as well as on the hydrological conditions in the watershed. A better understanding of DOM cycling is required to predict how metal speciation will affect fate and bioavailability of metals in aquatic environments. The boreal shield ecozone is a particularly important and sensitive region of Ontario where most of its streams and lakes are located. In this project, a metal speciation model will be developed and tested against field observations to predict how the metal speciation will affect fate and bioavailability of water-borne metals in boreal streams. The spatial and temporal change in DOM, as well as those in the metal speciation, will be investigated in two boreal streams of south-central Ontario. Laboratory experiments will be designed to investigate the influence of DOM dynamics and composition on metal binding properties. These experimental results will be incorporated into a model that describes the importance of DOM in metal speciation. This model will allow a synthesis of the overall effects of the DOM-metal associations and of their changes as the qualitative and quantitative character of the DOM varies in the study systems.","Not available","Environmental Earth Sciences"

"The cost of software maintenance amounts to at least 50% of the overall cost of software development. This percentage is high because programs under maintenance generally have poor quality characteristics---especially low maintainability---resulting from the developers' high turnover rate, time pressure, lack of explicit design choices, and architectural drift. The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the impact of design patterns and design defects on maintainability: to assess the use of design patterns by maintainers and to develop and apply a methodology to detect and to correct design defects. This assessment and methodology will deepen our understanding of software maintenance and allow the development of tools to improve the quality of programs and thus reduce the cost of maintenance.","Computer software","Computing and Information Sciences - A"

"BioMEMS (Bio-Microelectromechanical Systems) and microfluidic systems present unique characteristics that render them very attractive for the study of cell functions and of the impact of drugs at the level of single cells. In particular, they make it possible to alter cell culture conditions locally, by drug delivery, surface modification or mechanical stress, for example. The unifying thread in this research program will be the design, characterization and development of new cell-culture platforms for the detection of cell responses to controlled culture conditions. Its originality primarily lies in the integration on a single platform of microfluidics components and of arrays of electrochemical microsensors. In particular, arrays of ion-selective microelectrodes for real-time intra- or extracellular detection of cell responses will be combined with different types of drug delivery systems. These platforms have the potential to satisfy a broad range of applications varying from diagnostic, tissue-engineered products, to cell-based drug screening tools to basic molecular biology tools. This program, combining micro- and nanofabrication, microfluidics, and array of electrochemical microsensors will provide unique multidisciplinary experience to BScA, MScA, PhD students, as well as post-doctoral trainees. This training will be of great interest and relevance for Canadian ""high-tech"" and ""biotech"" industries, and for academics involved in the areas of biotechnology, micro-/nanotechnology and life sciences.

"We will develop an automated platform for routine organ-level investigation and automated screening of small blood vessel segments and their long-term culture. The platform will be based on the proof-of-principle Artery on a Chip (AoC) technology which we secured with a US provisional patent. Resistance arteries were so far reversibly loaded to the AoC device, fixed and functionally tested using manual procedures and irreversible fluidic connections. Loaded resistance arteries showed normal responses to vasoconstrictor and vasodilator stimuli, indicating that microvessel structure and function were maintained. We used aligned multilayer soft lithography to fabricate the proof-of-concept device. 



Investigating resistance arteries in an automated fashion will likely increase throughput significantly, encourage uniform handling and standardization, and may ultimately result in a major breakthrough in microvascular research. Even more importantly, it may make organ-level based screens applicable to early stages of the drug development process. The technology is applicable to target identification and validation, lead identification and lead optimization and therefore has the potential to significantly reduce time and costs for development and optimization of drug leads. In this project, we develop an improved AoC device that has two key capabilities for long-term artery culture: bubble removal and longitudinal artery stretching. A prototype Pogrammable Artery Culture and Experimentation (PACE) Platform will remove the last manual step of loading individual artery segments by integrating an automated artery loading procedure. A reversible fluidic manifold will integrate the AoC device with the PACE Platform and provide computer-controlled temperature control, artery fixation, perfusion, and superfusion. Time-dependent measurements of artery tone will be performed to obtain scheduled static and dynamic dose-response relationships. The PACE Platform will allow virtually every user to routinely study these very small and fragile arteries using a computer-controlled interface.

"My research is primarily directed toward understanding how stars work by analyzing the harmonic structure of sound waves that bounce around their interiors. The sound waves are not heard but seen. As a sound wave travels through the interior of a star it causes the material of the star to oscillate up and down into warmer and cooler regions of the star. The changes in temperature of the material can be seen on the surface of a star as minute variations in the star's brightness. From the brightness fluctuations, we can deduce the frequency and amplitude of the sound waves, which, in turn, can be used to build a picture of what is going on inside the star. Our methods are in many ways similar to the techniques used by seismologists to map out the composition of the interior of the earth using the vibrations produced by earthquakes.



In order to clearly see the fluctuations we need to observe the same star continuously for at least a couple of weeks, without interruption from weather and daylight. In addition, we need to avoid the twinkling effects of the earth's atmosphere. Therefore, we must observe from a ""space telescope"" specifically designed and dedicated to observing the tiny variations in light. Canadian scientists were the first to build and launch such a satellite. The satellite, called MOST (Microvariability and Oscillations on STars), has been in operation now for over three years. My research colleagues and I have been analyzing the data obtained from the satellite to build a detailed picture of the interiors of sun-like stars.



I will soon direct my attention to pre-main-sequence and giant stars. Pre-main-sequence stars are young stars, recently formed, still collapsing, and not yet burning nuclear fuel. Giant stars are swollen stars, near the end of their life. I along with other asteroseismologists (as we have come to call ourselves) hope to build a well constrained model of the birth, life, and death of stars like our sun.

"This research focuses on investigating advanced machine learning techniques with applications to engineering and business management. In the engineering area, we look at the analysis of the risk of failure of drinking water facilities. Contrary to what one may think, waterborne disease outbreaks in developed countries seem to continue to occur on a relatively regular basis. The reason for this phenomenon is not the lack of adequate treatment technologies. Rather it is the cumulative impact of a sequence of small individual events, each of which is relatively harmless on its own, that leads to the outbreak - hence the systemic nature of the causes of the failures, and the relevance of machine learning techniques such as kernels and pattern recognition algorithms (for the classification of a sequence of events as 'collapse-oriented' or 'survival-oriented'). In the business management area, the focus is on the topic of sales forecasting and management, which has a direct connection with the issue of job losses in the manufacturing sector in Ontario. This type of job losses is a direct consequence of the drop in manufacturing sales, which is itself due to the appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar. Such an appreciation leads indeed to the odd situation where Canadian products suddenly become more expensive for American customers, while the value-adding features of these very same products have not changed at all - hence the drop in sales. Laying-off workers has so far been the quickest way, for manufacturers, to react to this drop in sales. There is, however, no evidence that the laying-off of workers is the optimal control action (in the control-theoretic sense of the term) to react to currency appreciation. The applicant and his co-workers developed a quantified system to help salespeople and managers analyze their interactions with customers, develop sales forecasts and design adequate action plans for the future.

"Positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful diagnostic tool for the detection and follow-up of many medical conditions including cancer, heart problems and neurological disorders. The procedure requires the administration of a radiopharmaceutical prior to the PET scan and novel radiopharmaceuticals for the detection of specific medical problems are required to fully exploit this novel diagnostic tool. Peptide hormone receptors expressed in different medical conditions are of particular interest for the development of new, more specific radiopharmaceuticals. The object of this research program is to develop alternative synthetic approaches for the synthesis of a variety of novel peptide derivatives that can subsequently serve as tracers for improved,

site-specific radiopharmaceuticals for PET imaging. A second objective of the program is to develop rapid procedures to attach PET isotopes to the peptide analogs. To this end we propose to use our new peptide synthesis procedures to facilitate the incorporation of two readily available PET isotopes, fluorine-18 and copper-64. Thus, in addition to developing powerful, alternative synthetic procedures for the preparation and radiolabeling of peptide analogs, our program will provide a base for the design of new radiopharmaceuticals that will enlarge the number of medical conditions that can benefit from diagnostic PET imaging.

"Strong fluctuations in the total and relative abundance of species remain an unresolved problem in population and community theories. In marine systems, these fluctuations have mostly been studied assuming equilibrium dynamics driven by habitat properties. However, recent work shows how ecological and non-linear feedback processes involved in species interactions could trigger the existence of multiple equilibriums. The goal of my research program is to understand how these ecological processes, and more specifically those associated with spatial aggregation and with the development of ecological structures, operate in synergy to explain strong fluctuations and responses to the environment, from the scale of individuals to that of entire coastal regions. For example, can the development of individual mussels and of mussel beds interact with their spatial connectivity to generate strong feedbacks in their ability to preempt and their susceptibility to loose space? Can these feedbacks in turn drive strong fluctuations of densities across whole landscapes? Finally, can spatial structure at larger scales such as larval dispersal and/or regional habitat heterogeneity maintain fluctuations at the regional level? Toward that goal, I will adopt a multidisciplinary approach integrating (1) reciprocal transplant experiments, (2) non-equilibrium theories of space and ontogeny, and (3) cross-scale monitoring. The research proposed here will first lead to a theory of spatially structured ecosystems with ecological development (i.e. individual to ecosystem level developmental changes) and associated cross-scale fluctuations in heterogeneous landscapes (Project 1.a). Both local feedback processes and predicted fluctuations will be tested in a sub-arctic intertidal community.  Landscape level phenomena will then be integrated within a non-equilibrium theory of heterogeneous coastal systems coupled through larval dispersal that will be validated using large-scale data. Finally, I will apply theories to the persistence of seagrass ecosystems. Our effort is meant to lead to major paradigm shifts in large-scale marine ecology, and to reveal novel regional properties that foster predictability and management of complex systems with strong environmental heterogeneity.

"In recent years, more land has become contaminated with organic compounds such as oil, gasoline, pesticides, PCBs and explosives as well as inorganic compounds such as heavy metals and radioactive compounds. These contaminated lands pose a threat to the environment and to public health.  The contaminants can move into the air we breathe. They can also move into the water we drink and use for recreational purposes. Contaminants in soil may also find their way into the food chain through plants or animals that have been exposed to the contaminated soil. These sites also pose an economic burden since contaminated sites remain unused and therefore represent a loss in potential revenue through property taxes, etc.

    There are thousands of contaminated sites in Canada and many more around the world that must be cleaned up. To do this, we need new and innovative technologies that can clean up contaminated sites. Most research efforts to date have concentrated on developing technologies to clean up sites contaminated with organic compounds. Some research has address sites contaminated with inorganic compounds. Very few technologies can clean up soils contaminated with both organic and inorganic compounds.

    Supercritical fluid extraction is a technology that could potentially deal with these types of contaminated soils. It is a process that uses carbon dioxide to extract the compounds from the contaminated soils. The following proposal outlines a research program in which important preliminary design parameters will be determine and  unique experiments will be performed with soils contaminated with both organic compounds (petroleum hydrocarbons) and heavy metals (copper, cadmium, chromium, mercury and/or lead). The outcome of the research program will be important parameters necessary for the design of a supercritical fluid extraction system for the remediation of contaminated soils.  This information will lead to the design of a commercially feasible and effective innovative treatment technology that can deal with many of the challenging contaminated sites in Canada.

"Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the most widespread signaling molecules in mammals and is important in controlling nearly every cellular and organ function in the body. NO is synthesized in the body by enzymes named nitric oxide synthases or NOS. NOS enzymes are some of the most complex enzymes ever discovered.

Precise control of NOS enzymes is of potential therapeutic value since NO has diverse biological functions and is also a key part of several serious disease states. The long-term goals of our research program are to understand the regulation and mechanism of NOS enzymes.

Since NO plays multiple physiological roles in regulating varied and diverse organ functions, defects in NO production are also involved in a number of pathophysiological states including atherosclerosis, hypertension, stroke and vascular complications in diabetes.  NO is synthesized in the body by enzymes named nitric oxide synthases or NOS.  NOS enzymes are some of the most complex enzymes ever discovered.  Precise control of NOS enzymes is of potential therapeutic value since NO has diverse biological functions and is also a key part of several serious disease states. A significant number of fundamental questions about NOS need to be answered before we can take full advantage of the therapeutic potential of this target enzyme.  The long-term goals of our research program are to understand the regulation and mechanism of NOS enzymes and the role of NO in cell function, signalling and differentiation.  

 We use the recombinant forms of the three different mammalian NOS enzymes in our investigations.  Site-directed mutagenesis is used to decipher the role of important regions of the enzymes.  We learn about their fundamental properties by performing experiments on native and mutated forms of the enzymes.  For example, although all three enzymes are activated when bound to a calcium sensing protein called calmodulin, there are significant differences in the processes leading to the activation of each enzyme.  Our research program will provide an understanding of the important mechanism of calmodulin binding and activation of NOS enzymes.  We will also perform in vivo investigations using mammalian cell culture studies to understand how cell function, homeostasis and differentiation  as well as enzyme activity and are affected by the post-translational processing of the inducible NOS enzyme.  Gaining a better understanding of how these enzymes function may help in the development of therapies for a wide variety of diseases.

"Birds are highly mobile animals. In particular, migratory birds cross frontiers to breed, moult and winter at various locations over large geographic scales (300-8000 km). This very characteristic makes the study and conservation of migrating birds challenging. In the proposed research program, my aim is to describe the annual cycle of sea ducks and understand how the various biological phases are integrated chronologically and energetically in relation to breeding success. I will use (1) miniature data logging systems to monitor physiological (heart rate and body temperature) and behavioural (flying and diving) parameters, (2) collection of specimens to monitor body mass and body organs and, (3) breeding biology observations to relate events occurring during the annual cycle with breeding success. I believe that this research could be a breakthrough in the study of migratory birds in general because it is based on an innovative approach that allow the recording of highly pertinent information of individuals in the wild, that could not be otherwise obtained.

"The Bayesian nonparametric methodology developed in my Ph.D thesis has shown to work well in the context of copula estimation. Although frequentist estimators for the copula function usually have good asymptotic properties, some of them present notable drawbacks for inference using finite samples. The goal of the thesis is to get intrinsic estimators in order to propose a coherent treatment of the uncertainty relative to both, the estimation of the distribution using a finite sample and to the prevision of bivariate data. The idea is first to construct a nonparametric model for the copula functions. The nonparametric nature here means that the number of parameters in the model can be made arbitrarily large. The subspace spanned by the model is then shown to be dense in the space of copulas according to the sup norm. A prior distribution over the set of parameters is selected. The constraints on the parameter space and the complexity of the resulting posterior distribution requires carefully chosen MCMC techniques for inference.



The area of research I will primarily concentrate on is in finding new applications and fields which can benefit from this generic methodology. In particular, models will be constructed in the contexts of Archimedean copulas and multivariate extreme value distributions. 



I will also work in two other fields of Bayesian statistics that are unrelated to my thesis, that is statistical learning with graph-structured data and marked point processes for three dimensional cellular modeling. These are new areas in which I have recently started investing myself. 



Over all, I want to become an expert on the computational aspects of Bayesian statistics.

"I study the mutualistic interaction which exists between certain beneficial bacteria, the rhizobia, and legume plants.  As the result of this interaction, the rhizobia penetrate the plant root hairs and trigger the formation of a novel structure known as the nodule.  If the symbiosis is successful, the rhizobia, now hosted within the nodule, fix atmospheric nitrogen. When fixed in excess, the nitrogen becomes available to the plant. The early infection stages are thought to require two opposing chemical gradients across the cortex of the root; the successful integration of these gradients by the partners results in the initiation of the nodule. The first gradient is rhizobial in nature; complex molecules known as Nod factors are thought to be directed towards the root centre. This gradient triggers the first cell divisions of the inner cortex and the first morphological changes of the root hairs. The other gradient oriented towards the root surface is thought to involve plant hormones, specifically auxin and cytokinin (CK). In this application, I propose that, in response to the rhizobial infection, CKs coming from the vascular tissues located in the centre of the root move across several cell layers and accumulate into the inner cortical cells where they promote cell divisions. I postulate that the CKs pooled in these cells give positional information to the rhizobia, i.e., they act as a beacon, ""attracting"" the rhizobia towards the cells cluster.  To demonstrate that CKs are important signals for nodule initiation, I will (1.) create plant chimeras with altered CK levels; (2.) inoculate the chimeras and track the rhizobial infection at the cellular level; and (3.) follow the expression of molecular markers specific for certain steps of the infection. The methods used here will likely boost the use of pea as a model plant system as this plant is now amenable to molecular techniques. In the far future, results obtained in my research program could lead to the development of methods that could override mechanisms which prevent the proper establishment of the rhizobial symbiosis.  Agronomically, this development would be extremely worthwhile since successful infections of plants by rhizobia are a key step to reducing the use of chemical fertilizers on crop plants.

"This research effort is to contribute at building a value chain from lower quality biomass  towards bio-based energy production, namely methane- or hydrogen-enriched bio/syngas at high yield, accordingly, at turning environmental liabilities into economical opportunities. Biomass targeted as feedstock includes abundant and largely untapped sources such as : municipal solid wastes, municipal & pulp and paper biosolids, forestry and agriculture residues (straw, dead wood ...), perennial giant grass (switchgrass, miscanthus ...). When biomass is relatively dry and/or difficultly biodegradable, one possibility is to gasify the biomass and to use the synthetic gas (syngas) produced as a feedstock for gaseous fermentation. Syngas is mainly composed of carbon monoxide (CO), CO2 and hydrogen. A small number of microbes, often thermophilic, are able to grow on CO and H2 and reduce either CO into CH4, or protons into H2. Hence we plan to develop bioprocesses using those carboxydotrophic microorganisms, to upgrade syngas into H2 or CH4.

One facet of the project will be dedicated to the microbiology of carboxydotrophy. We will screen a few hydrogenogenic carboxydotrophic species (e.g. Carboxydothermus or Thermolithobacter spp. that are extreme-thermophiles, and have low doubling time) and optimize their growth conditions for H2 production from CO (pH, temperature, CO, H2 and CO2 content). Archaea capable of growth on CO, e.g. Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, will be optimized as well for the conversion of CO into methane. We also will investigate their tolerance to syngas impurities, such as volatile metal compounds.

In another aspect of the project, the selected microorganisms and optimal culture conditions will be implemented within bioprocess technologies suitable for processing gaseous streams; hence a special attention will be given onto the minimization of the gas-to-liquid transfer rate limitations.

"Accurate perception of social ranking and hierarchy is crucial for the inner cohesion of animal societies. Among the different perceptual cues which are conveyed between individuals, auditory information plays a central role in social communication in mammals. This is even more true for human beings. Indeed, in addition to natural screams, humans developed sophisticated spoken languages, which strongly rely on auditory performance. However, the fine psychophysical parameters which regulate the auditory component of social perception are still largely unknown.

Taking step on a unique combination of expertise in the field of bioacoustics and the field behavioral neuroscience, this research program aims to analyse the auditory component of social perception. The main approach of our research program is to generate innovative corpus of synthetic auditory (vocal) signals both in animals and in humans, and to analyze the effect of these messages on social perception and social behavior. Animal models will allow us to monitor behaviors in highly controlled situations, while human experiments will allow us to generate data closer to ""real-life"" situations.

The outcomes of this research program are expected to contribute to our knowledge of the basic mechanisms of maintenance of animal and human social structures. In addition to significant knowledge gain, this program will lead to the formation of several graduate and undergraduate students. This research program will further our understanding of animal and human behaviors, and has numerous practical applications in various engineering fields such as voice generation, development of virtual reality environments, or amelioration of human-machine interactions efficiency.",Psychology,"Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences"
"The equipment requested is to facilitate the further development of an innovative, integrated bacterial detection microchip in standard low-cost 0.18um CMOS technology that is able to identify live bacterial cells in less than ten minutes. This technology combines the specificity of viruses that infect and kill bacteria (bacteriophages or phages) with the sensitivity of integrated electronic circuits to create a rapid, low-cost, portable detection system. One important feature that distinguishes our approach is that it only generates a response in the presence of live cells; if a working surface is disinfected, residual DNA and other cell debris will not generate a response, thus allowing sterilization efficacy to be accurately determined. Low cell concentrations are typical in swabs used to gather samples in a clinical environment.  Our work is focusing on the advancement of the low detection thresholds necessary in this measurement device.



The chip has been used successfully in the laboratory to detect E. coli and P. aeruginosa in less than 10 minutes. It is important to note that once this technology has been fully developed it can be tailored to any bacterial species and provide rapid testing for food safety, water quality, agricultural testing of both plants and animals, and medical diagnostics. 



The equipment requested in this grant will: (i) greatly improve the speed and accuracy of our cell concentration measurements, and (ii) prevent cross-contamination of equipment and test devices ultimately ensuring both the validity of experimental measurements and an additional level of protection for research personnel.

"Research Project Summary



The central theme of the proposed research is algorithms, parallel VLSI architectures and SoC implementations of wireless digital communication systems.  In the domain of emerging wireless technologies few, if any, techniques hold more promise at improving spectral efficiency than Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless systems that use multiple transmit and receive antennas.  The goal of this research is to develop low-complexity digital communication algorithms for MIMO detectors that have both provably good performance and an efficient microelectronic realization.  A methodology to address this research challenge lies in very promising recent progress in reformulating algorithms for K-Best detectors.  The proposed research aims to develop high-throughput, low-power consumption realizations that provide soft outputs for use in coded MIMO systems.  The work is further extended by developing new insights into the realization and application of Lattice Reduction techniques to realize jointly optimized K-Best MIMO detectors.  An additional channel-processing task, QR Decomposition of the channel matrix H, is considered to further optimize performance, latency, throughput and power consumption for use in dynamic channel environments.  As part of a cost-effective microelectronic implementation strategy for MIMO baseband processing, we envision a set of flexible, high-performance, low-power cores or slices that support the necessary mathematic kernels structured in such a way so as to be scalable to different numbers of receive channels and performance requirements. This work will impact the way wireless systems for entertainment, education and commerce are designed and implemented improving the cost and performance of wireless systems that transport data, voice, video and secure information services.

"Turbulent premixed and partially premixed combustion is encountered in most practical combustion devices such as gas turbines, reciprocating engines, and industrial and domestic burners. In gas turbines, lean premixed combustion systems have an intrinsic attraction for controlling the combustion process and are the methods of choice. Fully premixed systems provide control over combustion chemistry, reaction kinetics, flame temperatures, and pollutant emissions. Premixed and partially premixed (stratified) charge concepts used in advanced direct injection spark ignition engines for light duty vehicles have the potential for substantial thermal efficiency improvements. 



Experiments have shown that turbulence increases the flame propagation rates in premixed combustion. However, the physics behind this effect has not been fully understood yet. One of the leading reasons for this is that the turbulent flame propagation display phenomena that are not common in other turbulent flames. In turbulent premixed flames, interplay of turbulence, thermodynamics, and chemical kinetics leads to a highly complex and convoluted situation. As a result, theoretical models and computational studies are far from explaining the experimental observations.



To exploit the potential of lean premixed and partially premixed combustion concepts for practical devices, a better understanding of the underlying physics is essential. The longer term objectives of this proposal is to provide information and new knowledge in the area of turbulent premixed and partially premixed combustion that can be used as tools in design of next generation of gas turbines and other combustion systems.

"People throughout the world are inherently and fundamentally mobile, they expect to be connected wherever they are. It is therefore not surprising that the wired world is rapidly becoming wireless. In addition, wired technology has advanced to the point where people expect very high speed, reliable real-time services in the home and elsewhere. It is natural that mobile users demand similar service levels. With this wireless revolution come many challenges to providing a positive user experience. Future wireless communications systems must be based on low cost, intelligent portable devices that can operate in a variety of hostile environments. The objectives of this research program are to develop innovative techniques for robust, low complexity, wireless multimedia communications systems. The goal is to produce future systems which can deliver high data rates; be efficient in both power and bandwidth; provide access anytime over a wide service area with multiple levels of reliable quality of service (QoS); and deliver diversified services with ease of use.

This research program will focus on several key enabling technologies which will accelerate the achievement of the above goals. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Ultra-WideBand (UWB) will be considered. These modulation techniques will dominate future wireless systems due to their flexibility, simplicity and robustness to fading. Optical wireless is a very promising high bandwidth, low interference alternative to RF communications. Future system must adapt to their environments, therefore low complexity adaptive techniques will be considered within the framework of resource management, cross-layer design and QoS. To achieve the goal of a consistent user experience, applications will have to be more efficient, and more intelligent. Networks that can adapt to the wireless environment are essential.  Thus this project will consider the design of systems that can dynamically adjust resources according to channel and traffic conditions. One major application for this work is the delivery of IPTV/Video on Demand (VOD), voice and data to the home, the so-called triple-play of services.

"The aim of this proposal is to design a mathematical modelling framework for assessing control strategies against the spread of some classes of human diseases of public health importance, notably childhood diseases, vector-borne diseases (e.g., dengue and malaria), sexually-transmitted diseases (e.g., HIV), respiratory diseases (e.g., seasonal and pandemic influenza, tuberculosis, SARS) and other vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., diphtheria, pneumococcal disease, rotavirus, yellow fever, typhoid, cholera).   Although many of these diseases are controllable and/or treatable, they continue to be major global menace.  For instance, figures from the World Health Organization show that nearly 46 million people currently live with HIV globally, and the disease has so far claimed the lives of over 20 million people.  

  

I intend to develop a mathematical modeling framework for studying the transmission and control dynamics of the above classes of diseases.  The models, which will be calibrated using available data, will then be used to evaluate various control strategies aimed at determining the most effective one(s) for each class of diseases.   The main strategies to be considered include the use of vaccine, drug treatment and quarantine and isolation.  



The novelty of this basic research includes the design of realistic models for gaining insights into the transmission dynamics and control of classes of human diseases.  Control measures for halting disease spread in resource-poor nations, which accounts for the highest disease burden globally, would also be designed.  The work would have important applications in the design of suitable vaccines and drugs, as well as the design of new mathematical methods for analyzing the relatively large models I will be dealing with.

"Pricing decision is one of the most common forms of marketing practices. It requires thorough understanding of all the factors that affect customers' ultimate purchase decisions. For most of the firms, pricing is not a static decision anymore. With the help of data processing technology and e-commerce, dynamic pricing has become more of a necessary capability that helps firms better match their supply with demand and increase their competitive advantage. In order to achieve this goal, a firm now has to continuously decide on when, how frequently and how much to change prices of its offerings. However, there are two issues related to dynamic pricing which, if not appropriately taken into account, can cause more damage than good. First issue is about the increased importance of coordination between pricing and operational planning decisions. Second issue is about the interaction between pricing decisions and customer behavior. In this research proposal, we address both issues and plan to build analytical and large scale optimization models in order to study the roles of customer behavior in coordinated price and inventory management. Our proposed research plan has three primary components.  First, we plan to develop a framework to model customer behavior and analyze it in deterministic production/inventory ordering setting. Next, we intend to extend the analysis by incorporating uncertainties in operational and marketing environment. Finally, we intend to develop decomposition approaches for inventory control and pricing problems in complex supply chains. This research will be among the first to develop novel models that consider the entire scope of the problem associated with dynamic pricing, from supply management -- procuring materials at the right time -- to demand management - understanding customer behavior and setting prices accordingly.  In addition, we will modify and apply existing techniques from a wide variety of related fields, and particularly the latest advances in customer behavior modeling in marketing and inventory and price coordination in operations in order to develop a thorough understanding of these models.","Production and operations management","Industrial Engineering"

"Programmed cell death (PCD) is a genetically-enabled process in which select cells organize their own destruction. PCD is ubiquitous in all eukaryotic kingdoms and is employed by both unicellular and multicellular organisms as part of normal development or in response to external stimuli. In plants, PCD is necessary for growth and survival and can either be developmentally regulated or environmentally induced. A unique example of developmental PCD is perforation (holes) formation in lace plant leaves. These holes are situated equidistantly between longitudinal and transverse veins, giving leaves a lattice-like pattern. During perforation formation, discrete subpopulations of cells undergo PCD while adjacent cells remain intact. I have characterized the cell death process during perforation formation in lace plant and showed that this aquatic plant is an ideal model system to study developmental PCD.  Lace plant is native to Madagascar and difficult to grow in aquarium conditions. I have successfully developed an axenically cultured lace plant system to work on developmental PCD. We still do not know what cues trigger PCD at the appropriate stage of leaf development, the signaling pathways, and the molecular mechanisms. Therefore, my overall aim is to identify factors inducing perforations and the mechanisms that regulate the PCD in lace plant using biochemical and microscopical techniques with four approaches: 1) To investigate changes in the actin cytoskeleton during lace plant PCD; 2) To compare induced and developmental PCD in the same plant species; 3) To develop both a stable and transient transformation protocol for lace plant; 4) To test the effect of calcium inhibitors on cell death in plants. These results will help us to determine whether there are common mechanisms between animal and plant PCD or whether they evolved independently.","Advancement of knowledge","Plant Biology & Food Science"

"In today's fast growing world of technology, many developments have been the result of old work done in pure mathematics. For example, many modern encryption techniques are based on number theory done in the 1600's, ideas that until recently seemed to be not much more than curious properties of the counting numbers. As another example, modern transportation or communication networks are presently analyzed and optimized using basic ideas from what is known as ""graph theory"", the study of properties of structures formed using dots and lines connecting the dots. My present research proposal considers the pure mathematics underlying many of these kind of applications, however I leave the ""applying"" to other specialists.  I am trying to discover more of what I consider to be beautiful properties of graphs and number theory independent of how they are utilized. It is the symmetry and inherent ""beauty"" of both number theory and graph theory, and how they relate, that forms the bulk of my research. Another area I plan to study is similar to graph theory,  called lattice theory, which studies special kinds of networks that have more ""order"" and symmetry.



For example, consider prime numbers, those that have no proper divisors (e.g., 7 or 29).  One can study sets of numbers that have only an even number of prime factors, and it turns out, a field called ""extremal graph theory"" plays a central role in such studies. Another area of graph theory, called ""Ramsey theory"", studies large structures and examines what kind of uniformity is preserved after such a large structure has been broken into pieces. One can solve many Ramsey-type questions using number theory, and number-theoretic results are also obtainable from Ramsey theory.  My research proposes to expose more of these wonderful connections, and perhaps someday, these will also be used more in modern network theory.

"This work involves the application of operations research methods in forest management and in production planning. The forest management work involves an integrated series of activities ranging from long term strategic models to detailled single stand decision making.  The production work is mostly focussed on manufacturing control.  The common links between these apparently different areas are in three main themes. One is the hierarchical planning approach.  Within this approach we have stressed optimization as means of exploring tradeoffs.  We plan to develop advanced techniques that permit analysis of economic and ecological tradeoffs in forest management similar to the use of exchange curve methods that we are pursuing in manufacturing control. A second is the  the use of integer programming methods to make discrete decisions. Successful use of integer programming requires strong formulations. We have created novel formulations in the areas of both forest harvesting under adjacency and in salmon aquaculture production planning.  A third area is the use of surface fitting methods in estimation and control.  This includes approximate dynamic programming approaches in stand level forest management and in economic lot sizing methods as well as the neural network methods that we use for manufacturing control and forest growth modelling.

"Growing markets for personal digital assistants, smart phones and personal computers in our present day information society has increased the need for greater processing power while maintaining miniature device form factors. This has placed an enormous burden on the design community to design faster circuits with better performance in a smaller area. In addition, owing to miniature feature sizes and massive integration, effects pertaining to distinct physics disciplines have started to surface together in modern devices. Commercial design tools built on traditional simulation engines are mostly restricted to analysis in a single discipline and are incapable of capturing the multi-disciplinary nature of these effects. Availability of reliable tools that facilitate multi-disciplinary simulation of devices and systems is essential in future design shops and can aid the design community to produce products with better quality in a cost-effective manner.

The proposed multi-disciplinary simulation approach and methodologies are targeted towards a wide range of physical implementation levels. The developed algorithms will greatly benefit the design automation market as well as the electrical design community in general.

"Computational science and engineering is a new interdisciplinary field arising in various fields of engineering and sciences such as mathematics, mechanics, biology, physics, chemistry, material science, earth science, medicine, public health. Validation and verification of models and computation become extremely important.

The proposed research project will focus on the modeling and computation of two nonlinear problems: corrosion protection and exterior problems of the Navier-Stokes equations outside a polygon. Various aspects of validation of models and verification of computation will be addressed for the corrosion protection problem such as calibration of the model, treatment of experiments data, parameters identification, determining the nonlinear boundary conditions, uncertainty, convergence and error assessment of error in the p and h-p finite soloutions. The research  will provide a mahematical guidance to design corrosion protection system.  For the Navier-Stokes equations we propose a mixed p and h-p finite element-spectral method to compute the solution of the exterior problem outside a polygon. This combination of two high order methods can overcome two major difficulties of computation at the vertices and infinity. We shall analyzing the convergence and stability of the mixed p and h-p finite element-spectral solutions and conduct an effective computation. The research will establish a new approach for numerical simulation of exterior problems in computational fluid dynamics. The approaches and techniques for these two particular problems can be applied or generalized to  other problems such as earth science, electro-magnetics, weather prediction, etc.

Besides these two new projects I will continue the research projects on the approximation theory and applications of the p and h-p finite element method in the framework of Jacobi-weighted spaces and to solve fundamental issues: optimal convergence on polyhedral domains; error in maximum value of the first derivative of the p and h-p finite element solutions; A-posteriori error estimation. Solving these problems will have significant impact on the theory and applications to structural mechanics and many fields of computational engineering and science.

"Odour and toxic gas (H2S and NH3) emissions from the intensive livestock operations have become a public concern due to their environmental impact and potential health impact on neighbouring residents. Determining science-based setback distance has become an urgent need. Using odour dispersion model to predict odour plume downwind and then determine reasonable setbacks based on acceptable odour criteria is a scientific approach. Source odour emission rates, which are changing constantly with animal and climatic conations, are the basic data needed for odour dispersion modeling. The diurnal and seasonal odour emission profiles need to be revealed and considered in odour dispersion modeling. Identifying major odour sources will help development and applying odour control technologies targeting major sources. Acceptable odour criteria (such as odour impact index) considering odour intensity, offensiveness, persistence, frequency, etc., need to be established. H2S and NH3 are toxic gases and the major odorants of livestock odour and need to be quantified.  

The overall goal of my research program in this area is to determine scientific separation distance between the neighboring land use and livestock farms. The detailed objectives of this proposed project are: a) to set acceptable odour criteria in term of odour impact index; b) to monitor diurnal and seasonal profiles of odour and gas (H2S, NH3, CO2) emissions and develop models for predicting odour and gas emission rates for various types of poultry, dairy, and beef (if necessary) production facilities and outdoor manure storages;  c) to develop a livestock odour dispersion model and validate the model using odour plume measurement data; and d) to develop a setback distance determination model for livestock farms using the odour dispersion model developed by this project, odour impact index, local odour emission data, and historical weather data. The results can be used by livestock industry, local governments to generate science-based setback distances to ensure the air quality of the neighbouring land use and promote the livestock industry by avoiding legal actions.

"Leaf area index (LAI) is a fundamental parameter for any work related to vegetation, but especially for modeling of natural phenomena. Specifically, it is a key element in climate models, hydrology models, and land surface processing models. The LAI is important because it is strongly related to the exchange of carbon dioxide, water, and energy between vegetation and atmosphere. Unfortunately, the vast majority of current models are based on low accuracy LAI estimates. This greatly limits the model's simulation and prediction accuracy. This alone demonstrates the strong need to improve LAI estimation and to provide a better approach for LAI parameterization. To respond to these concerns, the long term objectives of this program are threefold: 1) to improve LAI estimation accuracy with considerations of scale, heterogeneity, and land cover type; 2) to develop a better LAI parameterization approach for models in hydrology, climatology, and ecosystem; and 3) to investigate the effects of changes in land cover and land use on LAI dynamics. For the proposed five year period, my short term objectives are 1) to investigate spatial variation of LAI under different land cover types in Canadian prairies; 2) to develop a more accurate LAI derivation model from satellite imagery with considerations of topography, land cover, and vegetation condition; 3) to monitor temporal trajectory of LAI over the entire growing season; and 4) to assess the results of improved LAI on two well-established models. To achieve these goals, this program will study the target area at different spatial scales. Data will be collected at the field level and space level, covering different land cover types and spanning the entire growing season. Satellite imagery will range from high (10m), medium (30m), to low (1000m) resolutions. Output from this program will provide a better approach to LAI estimation and simulation for the Canadian prairies and will be applied to studies of the interaction between vegetation, atmosphere, and hydrology. The results of this research will eventually allow for a great improvement in the accuracy of any models relating to vegetation. Finally, this research program will provide a great opportunity for highly qualified personnel training.",Environment,"Environmental Earth Sciences"

The reason for the majority of these failures is the wrong or inaccurate estimation of one important design parameter, known as the channel-forming discharge.

First, they can change the structure of proteins thereby influencing the formation of protein complexes, and second, they can affect gene expression by varying crucial nucleotides recognized by regulatory proteins. Thus, understanding how changes in DNA are linked to phenotypic variations is a fascinating problem in modern biology. This proposal describes a series of experiments to address these questions. We will use the free-living tiny worms (nematodes) Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae that are roughly 1 millimeter long and composed of fewer than 1000 cells. In spite of millions of years of separation these animals share many genes with human and other organisms. This makes them an ideal model for understanding phenomena that occur in all eukaryotes. 



We will focus on the development of vulva, an egg laying and mating structure in female worms, which is composed of just 22 cells. In spite of its simplicity, the vulva exhibits functional complexities that are, in many ways, comparable to human organs. Furthermore, given the technical and ethical issues associated with doing experiments in humans, the nematode vulva offers an excellent alternative to study how genes function and regulate formation of tissues and organs. We will use multidisciplinary and cutting-edge approaches to identify genes that regulate the vulva formation in C. elegans and C. briggsae. We will determine their cellular and molecular roles and study the evolutionary differences between the two species. The findings will form the basis of future studies to examine human genes and how changes in gene function and regulation contribute to morphological and developmental diversity in animals.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Molec. & Develop.

"Coal represents more than 65% of total fossil fuel reserves in Canada and almost sixty million tons of coal is used every year for electricity production. Clean coal technology development is, therefore, a priority area of research and needs continuous improvements in increased efficiency and decreased pollutant emission. Trace elements (TEs) such as mercury, arsenic and selenium present in coal, even when present in parts per million levels, are of public health concern. There are two factors that determine the emission of trace elements: coal characteristics and the combustion environment. Coal characteristics include heterogeneity in both organic and inorganic matter including the distribution of trace elements in coal. These elements mostly evaporate during combustion and condense primarily on fine fly ash particles that are difficult to be captured. Any retention of the TEs in fly ash particles is strongly influenced by their association with other minerals in individual coal and mineral grains. The coal-mineral associations play an important role in the formation of fine particles, release of TEs and their subsequent condensation. 



In this project we wish to understand the impact of heterogeneous nature of coal on the formation of fine ash, nature of association of TEs with coal and other minerals, their release during combustion and gasification and subsequent condensation in presence of reactive or non-reactive fine particulate matter through fundamental studies. The approaches so far have mostly used thermodynamic equilibrium considering coal as a homogeneous material. The associations at individual coal particle level have been applied in the ash formation studies for ash issues in boilers by the applicant earlier and will be extended to investigate the release of the trace elements and integrate their subsequent condensation with the formation of fine particulate matter. This understanding would enable engineering the optimum capture of these trace elements.

"Most of our work can be looked upon as weighted models and their applications.  There has been considerable interest in studying weighted distributions. There is a large amount of literature available on the various aspects of weighted distributions. In some cases, formulation of weighted distributions can be of purely mathematical interest. However, they can also arise due to the nature of data collection or changes to some experimental conditions. 



We consider various methods of introducing shape parameter(s). Most of these methods result in weighted models. In a series of articles, Gupta and Kundu have introduced and studied quite extensively a new generalized exponential (GE) model. One can view the GE model as a weighted version of the exponential model. It can be used quite effectively for analysing  any skewed data in place of gamma, Weibull or log-normal models. We plan to continue our work on the GE model. We also plan to develop bivariate and multivariate GE models with GE marginal distributions. 



In the proposed research, we will consider various ways of formulating skew models and compare their theoretical properties and suitability to analyse skewed data. The power normal distribution is an alternative to the skew-normal model. We plan to develop inference procedures for this model. The class of multivariate skew-normal distributions is a subclass of multivariate Liouville distributions (MLD). In a series of papers, Gupta and Richards have developed numerous properties and applications of MLD.  The joint density of MLD can be considered as weighted joint density with weight function being the sum of the variables. We plan to continue further development of properties and applications.

"The goals of the proposed research are to understand and parameterize experimentally the physics of air sea interaction. Characterization of this phenomenon will provide a better understanding the basic mechanisms that control this interaction which plays a dominant role in weather prediction models, climate changes and biological and physical oceanography. The proposed research focuses on processes that occur in the oceanic and atmospheric wave boundary layers, which are regions influenced by ocean surface waves. The investigation will focus on processes that couple the turbulent atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers across the interface through the exchange of momentum, mass, and heat. Understanding the influence of surface waves and determining the 3-D structure of these boundary layers is one of the main objectives of this work.

The work will be performed at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory at UWO. One of the two wind tunnels has movable floor panels which enable simulation of a water tank beneath the wind tunnel. In addition, the water tank has a wave generator to simulate surface wave conditions. The flow velocity measurements are achievable by using advanced experimental methods, such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). This experimental technique is intended for the use in conjunction with another non-intrusive method, Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF). 

The work will include quantifying the turbulent kinetic energy budget and the momentum, mass, and heat budgets in the oceanic mixed-layer and atmospheric boundary layer. Novel instrumentation development efforts will be included, particularly for the interface region where air and water will be measured instantaneously. Furthermore, the turbulence structure of the flow at this region will characterized using statistical approach such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) which will serve to study the effects of the turbulent part of the flow on the phenomena. Moreover, the experimental data will be used to along with numerical data to develop a technique for decomposing waves and turbulence in oceanic flows.",Engineering,"Mechanical Engineering - B"

"The aim of the proposed research is to understand basic mathematical equations which describe physical systems such as ferromagnets and superconductors. The equations are non-linear and cannot be solved analytically (and often are difficult to solve even with the help of a computer). So we hope instead to obtain a clear picture of how solutions behave -- to determine their essential qualitative features -- by utilizing a variety of mathematical techniques.



In ferromagnets, for example, we would like to determine if the commonly used mathematical models always give a fair description of the physics, or if they might break down (""singularity formation"") in some circumstances, necessitating a deeper mathematical description. And we would like to exploit the equations to understand the long-time dynamics (after transient behaviour has died off) in the ferromagnet.



It turns out that many other physical systems -- such as superconductors, lasers, and water waves -- are governed by quite similar equations, and can be productively analyzed with a similar approach.

"I do research in metric geometry.  Metric geometry is the field of geometry where the main objects are distance, length, area, and volume.  Length, area, etc, are fundamental objects in geometry which one studies beginning

in high school.  It might seem natural to guess that such basic objects are completely understood, but that is

not the case.  In fact, over the last thirty years, mathematicians have found more and more open problems about these basic objects.



As an example, let me describe one of the questions raised in my thesis.  Suppose that we have a shape in ordinary three-dimensional space made out of rubber, and suppose that the volume of the shape is 1 cubic meter.  The shape may be rather long and thin, like a large spider web, or it may be some other complicated shape.  Because it is rubber, the shape can be bent to some extent without tearing.  Starting from its rest position, the material can be stretched in any direction up to a factor of two, or it may be compressed up to a factor of two, but it cannot be stretched or compressed any further.  The question is the following: subject to these physical restrictions, can we always bend the shape so that it fits in a cubical box whose sides have length 10 meters?  If so, how can we describe the procedure for bending the shape?



In classical geometry, one typically considers completely rigid shapes, such as perfectly straight lines.  Thinking of shapes made out of less rigid materials leads to very different questions and a different point of view about geometry.  One can further explore different (imaginary) materials, with different rules about how they are allowed to bend.

"I have developed a general approach to predicting rate constants for chemical reactions from the corresponding equilibrium constants. This requires no kinetic information and generally requires only relatively low levels of MO theory to calculate distortion energies. The key assumption in my approach is that if only one thing happens to a molecule (geometry change with no change in bonding or bonding change with no change in geometry) then the energy is a quadratic function of a suitable reaction coordinate. The kinetic barrier (intrinsic barrier) for a real reaction arises from the need for more than one thing to happen for a real chemical transformation. This approach has been very successful in tests to date, both published and still in progress.

     The goal of my research program is to test this approach over the widest possible range of reactions, inorganic as well as organic, and to develop and make available software which will make it easy for others to apply the method. Not only does the method allow prediction of rates of reaction, it also provides a general mechanistic criterion by allowing a clear test of whether or not a proposed mechanism is compatible with the observed rate constant. Furthermore the approach has value as a qualitative way of thinking about reactions as well as for quantitative predictions. Important near term goals are to extend this approach to intramolecular reactions and to test it in a range of solvents. Ultimately it is hoped that the method can be applied to explaining the rate enhancements in enzyme catalyzed reactions, which continue to represent the largest unsolved set of problems facing physical organic chemistry.

"Research carried out over the last ten years has shown that Soft Magnetic composites (SMC) materials are good candidates to replace laminated steel sheets in electric motors. Indeed their increased isotropy combined with a near net shape forming technology allow motor designers more flexibility for efficient designs. Laminates-based motor designs have limitations due to their stacked geometry. This is particularly true for high efficiency motors needed for hybrid power trains used in the transportation sector. New designs are possible with SMC technology and have the potential to greatly improve power to weight or power to volume ratio of motors and decrease their manufacturing costs. However SMC materials available on the market are based on water atomized iron particles. These types of SMC materials do not have sufficiently good mechanical and magnetic properties to fully benefit from the design advantages brought by the SMC technology. By combining different technologies, direct casting of ribbons, Sol-Gel/ PVD coatings and powder metallurgy, it should be possible to obtain a low cost magnetic material with high mechanical and magnetic properties. This project will focus on the possible development of a new continuous process of direct casting to be able to obtain very thin ribbon (~50 �m) of high temperature crystalline ferromagnetic material at low speed (less than 5 m/s). Ribbons will have to be coated and annealed on special conditions to obtain an acceptable grain growth to compete with present rolled laminations used in electric motors. Ribbons will be cut in lamellar particles and shaped with powder metallurgy techniques. Mathematical modeling of heat transfer on a 45° tilted melt dragging process will be made to understand the main variables and limitations for ribbon production for lamellar SMC. Surface of ribbons will be studied and modified to be adapted to Sol-Gel Coatings and grain coarsening treatments. Composite sintering behavior, mechanical and magnetic properties with different particles shape and thickness will be studied. Finally a motor prototype will be made and tested.","Transportation systems and services","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Manufacturing"

"Pathogens and their hosts continuously engage in a relentless and often deadly struggle mediated and modulated by diverse suites of virulence factors on the pathogen side, and surveillance and defense sys-tems on the host side. Characterizing these factors is central to understanding and controlling disease. This proposal describes an ambitious, novel, and robust means to identify and characterize what are arguably the two most significant factors influencing disease and defense: pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and type III secreted effector proteins (T3SEs). PAMPs are microbial factors that are recognized by receptors on plant and animal cells, and which induce immune or defense responses. T3SEs are bacterial proteins injected into host cells to disrupt the induction of these immune responses. We have developed a PAMP screen which has already dramatically increased our understanding of the breadth and nature of these important molecules. The proposed work will further refine our inventory of PAMPs, clearly identify the suite of host defense receptors that recognize each PAMP, trace the defense signaling networks to determine their variety, specificity, and interdependence, determine how sensitive these defense signaling pathways are to disruption by T3SEs, and then assess the role that natural variation among PAMP alleles plays in influencing host specific interactions. Importantly, this study will provide a very general framework for studying PAMPs in any system, and specifically proposes to develop a general tool for these studies. The PAMPs identified in this study have the potential to be used as novel antimicrobial agents as they can be deployed in a range of different formats, and induce immunity in very specific ways. The study will take advantage of the hard work already done by co-evolutionary process to reveal the 'weak links' in defense signaling networks - those points in the defense network most vulnerable to pathogen attack. We will identify the bacterial virulence proteins that target these weak links. The net result of these studies will be a vastly enhanced understanding of the factors that influence innate immunity - factors that immediately impact our health, our food supply, and our environment.

"The sub-cellular molecular events that occur at the cell periphery are crucial for organ development, maintaining cells and tissues, and healing.  Aberrations to the ""normal"" functions of proteins within cells often lead to the manifestation of diseases. The cellular skeleton (the cytoskeleton) is a dynamic grouping of filamentous protein-based structures.  In the majority of cells, the most prominently studied of these components are the actin filaments.  These filaments are key sub-cellular elements involved in whole cell movement, transport of particles within cells, and the internalization of molecules from outside of the cell to the cell interior.  During bacterial interactions with cells, these organisms often commandeer the cells for their own purposes.  One of these bacteria, enteropathogenic E.coli (EPEC), remain outside of the host cells and inject bacterial proteins to control the host cell's functions.  These bacteria continuously interact with the cell periphery and generate actin-rich structures (called ""pedestals"") at the bacteria/host cell contact points.  Proteins identified at these sites are essential factors for normal cellular functions.  In order to identify new proteins at the cell periphery, we will examine EPEC generated pedestals and exploit them as a model system.  As pedestals are of uniform length and are relatively large, we will use advanced cell biological techniques to identify and functionally determine proteins in these structures.  Newly identified proteins will be extensively characterized at pedestals and the cell periphery in motile as well as immotile cells.  Through understanding the molecular components at the cell periphery, the work outlined in this proposal will generate profound insight into normal cellular physiology and will provide targets to examine during various diseases.

"Software Infrastructures for Next-Generation Groupware

Real-time distributed groupware - systems that allow people to work together at the same time over distance - is now becoming common: for example, screen-sharing software, meeting support systems, instant messengers, multi-player action games, and VoIP telephones are now readily available. The design and development of these kinds of groupware has been greatly aided by groupware toolkits and libraries that handle distributed-system issues such as network connection, message distribution, session management, shared data, and remote execution. These software infrastructures have allowed developers to shift their focus from low-level details to higher-level design of the applications. 

     Despite these successes, however, current groupware is still severely limited. Although people can now make do with current technology, groupware does not come close to the richness and simplicity of working in a face-to-face situation. Systems are still complicated to initiate, still do not allow subtle or expressive interaction, and still perform poorly on real-world networks like the Internet. This research project will design and build a new set of software infrastructures for the next generation of groupware systems - systems that allow much richer interaction, that require almost no effort to set up, and that operate in real-world network conditions. 

     The project will develop four aspects of groupware infrastructure: performance techniques, session management systems, tools for enriched interaction, and mechanisms for protecting privacy. This research will provide tools and techniques that overcome current barriers to effective collaboration, and will allow designers to look at new interaction styles, innovative collaborative processes, and new application domains.

"The fundamental forces of nature are one of the fascinating subjects that can be studied at ISAC, Canada's new world-class radioactive beam facility at TRIUMF. In particular, the weak force, causing the beta-decay of nuclei, is unique in exhibiting the phenomenon of parity-violation: the mirror images of physical processes mediated by the weak force are not observed in nature. ISAC offers a unique possibility to study atomic parity-violation in francium (Fr), an element combining a very heavy nucleus (Z=87) with the simple, essentially hydrogenlike, valence structure of an alkali. Fr nuclei are the least stable among the first 103 elements in the periodic table, the longest-lived isotope decays in only 23 minutes. To make optimum use of the minute sample, the Fr atoms will be slowed down with laser light and captured into a `magneto-optical' laser trap, suspended in free space at temperatures millions of times colder than room temperature. Precise laser spectroscopy will allow us to observe the effects of parity-violation. The ultimate goal will be to search for `new' physics outside the - so far very successful - Standard Model of particle physics. The great technical challenge of this experiment is to implement robust and extremely efficient atom-manipulation and signal-detection methods to make optimum use of the minute Fr sample.

"The TRIUMF Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear science (TITAN) facility is a multi-component ion trap system that provides unique research possibilities in the fields of atomic, nuclear, neutrino and particle physics. The system is set up for maximum performance with short-lived radioactive nuclei, and hence provides an ideal tool for experiments at ISAC, the world's premier exotic beam facility, located at TRIUMF. Proposed experiments to be carried out with TITAN include high precision mass determination for aid in testing the Standard Model of Particle Physics, to test the behavior of nuclei far away from the valley of stability, to gain better understanding of halo nuclei, atomic nuclei with a 'neutron skin'. One of the key new features of TITAN will be the capability to work with highly charged ions (HCI) bred in an electron-beam ion trap (EBIT). To reduce the kinetic energy of the HCI exiting the EBIT, we are developing a cooler Penning trap where clouds of HCI are confined simultaneously with a cold electron or proton plasma, resulting in the sympathetic cooling of the HCI.

"The development of cleaner and environmentally sustainable sources of energy is one of the most significant scientific and technological issues facing mankind in the 21st century, with profound societal, economical and geo-political implications. Electrochemical power sources such as various fuel cell types, batteries and supercapacitors are among the leading options in this endeavor. The main focus of the present research program is on fuel cells that are not using hydrogen, so-called 'direct' fuel cells based on alcohols, formic acid and borohydride. Direct fuel cells compared to hydrogen cells are characterized by higher thermodynamic energy densities, simpler fuelling infrastructure and versatility of application (from micro-electronics to transportation). However, a major challenge is the sluggish electro-oxidation kinetics of the various fuels (methanol, ethanol, formic acid and borohydride) in conjunction with the efficient utilization and stability of the catalyst in operating fuel cells.

In this context, the goal of Dr. Gyenge's research program - building on the achievements obtained with the previous funding from NSERC - is the development of high-performance and cost-effective electocatalyst systems composed of novel catalyst nanostructure - support - ionomer interfaces. The research program targets the development of novel catalyst nanostructures and the understanding of the interaction between the catalyst layer and the electrode design regarding two-phase (gas/liquid) flow in order to improve the catalyst utilization efficiency and stability. A multi-disciplinary approach is employed combining fundamental electrochemical and surface analytical methods with electrode and fuel cell engineering  studies and innovations. The proposed research has significant intellectual property potential for the benefit of the Canadian alternative energy sector and it could applied to other areas as well, such heterogeneous catalysis.

A major contribution of this program will be the continued successful education of highly-skilled professionals in an area in which Canada can play a world-wide leadership role.

"The proposed research concerns the development of sophisticated solution methods for large scale network design problems with application to recent problems in logistics and telecommunications. Network design problems spawned a substantial amount of research and continue to attract much attention because of their theoretical and practical significance.  Network design lies at the intersection of several disciplines; namely, operations research/management science, graph theory, engineering and computer science. Most network design problems are hard optimization problems and are large in size. In addition,  recent advances in technology and business strategies lead to an array of  challenging issues that made most classical models obsolete. There is an urgent need to build network design models that capture the complexity of recent applications  and to develop specialized optimization tools in order to  provide efficient and meaningful solutions.   For example, recent  applications of network design include: collaborative transportation systems design, hybrid telecommunications network design, service systems design, global supply chain network design, etc. 

Network design problems are usually modeled as large mixed-integer programming problems and are characterized by a graph-theoretical component that defines the network structure and a design component that captures  restrictions pertinent to the specific application. Exploiting this component characteristic through decomposition and relaxation is the key to developing efficient algorithms.  The ultimate goal of my research program is to develop a decision support tool for network design problems that is built on top of specialized algorithms and  that can identify problem structure and apply the appropriate solution approach.

"The semantic web extends the WWW from a collection of data and documents, that are designed for human consumption and are often hard to find and use, into a collection of knowledge that is understandable and very convenient to use by humans as well as computer programs. The knowledge available in the semantic web depends on wide-spread information (e.g., collections of web pages) and on the compilation of information into (often distributed) formal ontologies or knowledge bases. The Web Ontology Language (OWL) was approved in 2004 as a W3C recommendation. It is a response to the semantic web initiative and has become a de-facto standard in knowledge representation for many scientific communities as well as companies and governments. OWL is partially based on a family of knowledge representation formalisms called description logics. The appeal of description logics is the immediate availability of highly optimized reasoners offering a wide range of automatic inference services relevant for supporting the semantic web. Description logic reasoners are usually based on so-called tableau procedures requiring highly sophisticated optimization techniques due to their inherent runtime complexity. The first objective of this proposal is to achieve better reasoning scalability and to support persistency. This goal is due to recent developments in the semantic web community where (simple description logic) reasoning has been applied to very large ontologies consisting of up to millions of assertions. The challenge is to provide persistency and ensure scalability even if complex reasoning is required. This motivates the need to design and evaluate tableau optimization techniques which support scalable reasoning on persistent and virtually unlimited ontologies. The second objective is to develop novel optimization techniques for combinations of description logic constructors such as number restrictions, nominals, and inverse roles because known techniques are insufficient.

"Imaging with 3D laser scanners is a rapidly growing commercial technology for maintenance construction

projects on existing industrial plants. A new approach that integrates this technology with 3D design models

has been developed that facilitates automated recognition with extremely high recall rates ofthree-dimensional

3D design objects from 3D site laser scans. Using this approach, it is possible to visualize the 3D status of a

project and to potentially automate key tasks related to project control. Such tasks include: (l) remote and

automated 3D progress and productivity tracking, (2) remote design and diagnostics, (3) automated semantic

search and retrieval of objects from 3D image databases, (4) automated identification of safety code violations,

and (5) remote construction dimensional quality assessment and quality control. Before this technology can be

widely deployed for these tasks, some research questions need to be addressed, including for example: (I) to

what extent would a 4D project model contribute to improved accuracy of design object retrieval from 3D

point clouds by allowing schedule and resource constraints to be imposed on the recognition process, (2) will

semantic based reasoning applied to BIM (Building Information Models) enhance object retrieval accuracy by

allowing physical constraints to be imposed on the recognition process, and (3) can temporary construction

objects such as scaffolding, formwork and shoring be effectively automatically identified and retrieved by

leveraging the advantages ofthe method described above. The overall goal of the research proposed here

would be to answer some ofthese questions. Doing so will expedite the application of the 3D imaging

technologies described in order to save costs and remotely deploy expertise for improved construction

"Funds are requested to purchase meteorological buoys to be deployed on sea ice floes to track ice motion, to observe meteorological conditions, and to study thermodynamic ice growth and snow accumulation. The requested instrumentation is essential to support long-term in-situ observations of the sea ice mass balance in the Arctic Ocean. These observations are the key component of a comprehensive research program just initiated at the University of Alberta to study changes of Arctic sea ice, in particular changes of ice thickness, in relation to variations of other climate parameters, by means of in-situ, airborne, satellite remote sensing and modeling work. The main area of the planned field work will be the region of thick multi-year ice of the Arctic Ocean between the coast of Canada and the North Pole. The research is significant as the areal coverage of Arctic sea ice is strongly decreasing, at a pace much faster than predicted by any climate model. This demonstrates our poor understanding of climate processes and feedbacks in the Arctic. The disagreement can partially be explained by a misrepresentation of the sea ice mass balance in those models, which is largely due to a general lack of systematic ice thickness observations in the Arctic Ocean. The initiated work is unique worldwide, and will contribute to systematic observations of changes of ice thickness and ice dynamics, and to the establishment of a future collaborative Canadian Arctic Sea Ice Mass Balance Observatory (CASIMBO) by leading Canadian universities and government agencies.","Oceans, seas and estuaries",Geosciences
"Support is requested to cover some of the extra costs associated with working in the North. Specifically, my group will perform biannual, long-term measurements of sea ice on the Arctic Ocean along the northern coast of Canada. 

My research is concerned with the role of sea ice in the climate system, both as an indicator and modulator of changes of atmosphere-ice-ocean processes. In particular, I am interested in changes of the sea ice mass balance as a result of variations of the thermodynamic and dynamic boundary conditions for ice growth, melt, and deformation, including the role of the snow cover. While my studies generally include both Arctic and Antarctic sea ice, the recent focus of my research is the establishment of long-term, systematic ice mass balance observations of thick multi-year ice in the Arctic Ocean between the coast of Canada and the North Pole. These observations will include biannual airborne electromagnetic measurements of the seasonal and interannual ice thickness variability, as well as observations of ice deformation and snow properties. In-situ measurements will be complemented by satellite remote sensing and modelling work, and will contribute to the validation of new satellite products and model results. 

The research is significant as the areal coverage of Arctic sea ice is rapidly decreasing, at a pace much faster than predicted by any climate model. This demonstrates our limited understanding of climate processes and feedbacks in the Arctic. The disagreement can partially be explained by a misrepresentation of the sea ice mass balance in existing climate models, which is largely due to a general lack of systematic ice thickness observations in the Arctic Ocean. The observational and interpretive program which I am initiating in Canada will be unique worldwide in its application of long-term airborne measurements of large-scale interannual and seasonal sea ice thickness variations in an important region of the Arctic, and will contribute to systematic observations of changes of ice thickness and ice dynamics.

"My research is concerned with the role of sea ice in the climate system, both as an indicator and modulator of changes of atmosphere-ice-ocean processes. In particular, I am interested in changes of the sea ice mass balance as a result of variations of the thermodynamic and dynamic boundary conditions for ice growth, melt, and deformation, including the role of the snow cover. While my studies generally include both Arctic and Antarctic sea ice, the recent focus of my research is the establishment of long-term, systematic ice mass balance observations of thick multi-year ice in the Arctic Ocean between the coast of Canada and the North Pole. These observations will include biannual airborne electromagnetic measurements of the seasonal and interannual ice thickness variability, as well as observations of ice deformation and snow properties. In-situ measurements will be complemented by satellite remote sensing and modelling work, and will contribute to the validation of new satellite products and model results.

"The proposed research program is directed to developing the management systems and associated technical foundations for civil infrastructure assets.  Much of the pioneering work in the area was carried out in pavement management systems.  The opportunity exists to build on that work and advance the state of knowledge and practice in other civil infrastructure asset areas.  In realizing this opportunity the management processes and technologies involved must be cost-effective, efficient, safe, environmentally responsible and basically incorporate good science and engineering.  More specifically, the objectives of the research include the following:

1.    )	Developing generic protocols for life cycle analysis of civil infrastructure assets.  This involves economic costs, plus environmental and resource utilization impacts as well as extension to very long life assets.

2.    )	Developing integration platforms for asset management systems which include location referencing, asset valuation, corporate data bases, level of service concepts and risk exposure.  This initiative addresses the need to simultaneously consider competing investment alternatives.

3.    )	Applying the concepts and methodologies of knowledge management into the broad area of asset management and involving not only people but also succession planning for technologies and information.

4.    )	Advancing the methodology and state-of-practice for mechanistic-empirical pavement design.  



The approach to fulfilling these objectives is to work within an asset management framework, employ new technologies with high potential and fully utilize the capabilities of graduate and undergraduate students.  In turn, the significance of the research lies in various economic, technical and other benefits, including contributions to increased national competitiveness, improved or new technologies for the nation's civil infrastructure and adding to the talent pool of highly qualified people.

"The major goal of the research performed in my laboratory is to discover novel strategies for controlling blood vessel formation in skeletal muscle.  Growth of new blood vessels is a necessary physiological response that is compromised in some disease states, such as diabetes.  Efficient manipulation of blood vessel growth (also called angiogenesis) requires a thorough understanding of the intricacies of the growth process in order to select appropriate and effective therapeutic targets.  My research group has demonstrated that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an integral role in the initiation of angiogenesis in skeletal muscle by selectively cutting the mesh-like matrix that surrounds blood vessels, enabling new blood vessels to sprout.  We now study the ways in which these MMPs are controlled during the process of blood vessel sprouting.  In this proposal, we will determine some of the key stimuli that can increase the amount of MMPs available, and how these stimuli direct the organization of MMPs at the tips of sprouting blood vessels, thus provides focused cutting of the matrix immediately in front of the sprouting tip.  The findings from my research will provide building blocks for the future successful development of new strategies for controlling blood vessel growth in individuals lacking sufficient blood supply to their skeletal muscle, improving quality of life and decreasing health costs.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Integrative Animal Biology"
"    )	Scientific demonstration of controlled fusion, using deuterium and tritium as fuel, has been achieved during the 1990s in the US/TFTR and EU/JET tokamaks, the latter being the world's largest fusion device. The latest major undertaking in fusion power R&D is the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, ITER, aimed at demonstrating self-sustaining fusion reactions in a practical machine. ITER is under construction in France. Among the critical issues facing ITER is the selection of materials for plasma-facing components, specifically the first wall of the vacuum vessel and the divertor. Current ITER design calls for beryllium for the vessel wall, carbon for the high heat flux targets of the divertor and tungsten elsewhere in the divertor. 

    )	Motivated by R&D needs for future fusion devices, such as ITER, my group's research focus will continue to be on the interaction of the edge plasma with first wall and divertor materials. The primary objective is to study the fundamental processes occurring during plasma-materials interactions and apply the results to reactors. We will perform experiments on materials erosion and hydrogen retention and diffusion in plasma-simulation facilities, which include mass-analyzed single and dual-beam ion accelerators, low-energy ion guns, permeation facility, apparatus for thermal desorption spectroscopy, and a tritium laboratory. The unique experimental capability of our dual-beam ion accelerator - coupled with line-of-sight mass spectroscopy (LOS) for detecting reaction products - provides an excellent opportunity to study the effects of two-species irradiation of materials. 

    )	The proposed research will concentrate on C and W, two of the materials planned for ITER. We will study the effectiveness of thermo-oxidation for removing D-containing codeposits formed in tokamaks and produced in our lab. Using our single- and dual-beam ion accelerators, we will study D retention in W under varying irradiation conditions, including simultaneous He+-D+ irradiation. Also with the dual beam, we will study the erosion of mixed C-W layers formed during exposure of W to simultaneous C+ and D+ ions.

"This Chair will migrate current computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools that are simply used as a ""virtual wind or icing tunnel"", towards a fully-coupled multidisciplinary ""design"" environment. The industrial scope of the Chair and its impact will be quite broad through the participation, along with Bombardier, of Bell Helicopter and CAE Inc. The five (5) research areas of the Chair are:

-An in-flight icing simulation code that optimizes ice protection systems against supercooled large droplets (SLD), accounting for droplet deformation, break-up and splashing;

-A control theory-based aerodynamic shape optimization design environment permitting engineers to select the best wing possible in a single calculation rather than by tedious trial-and-error procedures;

-An automatic mesh adaptation approach that significantly improves the accuracy of lift, drag and moments prediction;

-A CFD pre-processor for simulation on massively parallel machines 

-Reduced order models for cost-effective real-time CFD solutions to be used in icing training simulators.

The research will maintain the leadership of Canadian aerospace companies in aircraft/rotorcraft/flight simulation technologies through faster designs and higher efficiency in terms of performance, range, and safety in icing certification and pilot training.

"Civil infrastructure systems are the most expensive assets in any country. In Canada their value is an estimated CAD$2 trillion. These structures are deteriorating at an alarming rate due to inadequate maintenance, excessive loading, economically-driven design practices, and adverse environmental conditions. Feedback on the state of health of today's civil infrastructure is practically non-existent. It has been estimated that decades of under funding have left Canada with about CAD$60 billion in outstanding infrastructure repair and replacement cost. Such a problem is not unique to Canada. In a new report released March 25, 2009, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) estimated that the US needs to invest US$2.2 trillion of repairs and upgrades over the next 5 years to bring its infrastructure to an acceptable level. Bridges and road networks are two of the key components of Canadian infrastructure. Current monitoring techniques for the infrastructure are manual, error-prone, and temporally-sparse. Therefore, new systems and methodologies are needed for effective and yet economically-tractable monitoring of Canada's decaying bridges and road network. The design criteria for the proposed system and methodology include: a) allowing for more frequent inspection of the roads and bridges while reducing the cost and increasing the quality of the monitoring process, b) using low-cost and durable sensors, and c) having on-site artificial intelligence. This research will be achieving these goals using a mobile mapping system for coarse-scale monitoring, where problem areas are identified and the deployment of a fine-scale monitoring system for detailed inspection of problem areas.","Surveying and photogrammetry","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Communications and Information"
"In its report ""State of the World Cities 2006/07"", the United Nations is predicting that 2007 will see more people living in urban than rural areas. The number of dwellers in urban areas is expected to rise to almost 5 billion inhabitants by 2030. Such population will roughly constitute 62% of the global population at that time. Accelerated urban growth can be also seen in Canada. A recent report of a study conducted by Statistics Canada for tracking Canadian demographic changes between 1971 and 2001 revealed that the population living in metropolitan areas witnessed an increase of 45%. In comparison, the population living in rural areas only grew by 13%. To avoid social and environmental problems arising from this rapid urbanization, federal and local governments must have access to accurate and current geo-spatial information in a timely manner to assist decision makers in understanding, planning, and managing a continuously changing environment. With the major paradigm shift in modern Earth observation technology over the last two decades, in terms of influx of geo-spatial digital data from multi-sensory systems, it has been recognized that the research and academic communities should develop practical and accurate tools for assisting urban planners and environmental mangers in exploiting these datasets. In this regard, there has been an increasing need to develop new procedures to allow for the manipulation of geo-spatial data while reducing the incurred costs, defining standards and specifications for Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) of the involved systems and acquired data, and promote data sharing policies and practices. Addressing these needs is the main objective of this research. More specifically, the research will focus on the development of QA/QC procedures to screen and improve the quality of available geo-spatial data; development of automated registration procedures for the alignment of multi-sensory data in a common reference frame; development of automated procedures for the extraction of relevant information from registered multi-sensory data (e.g., land-cover classification, man-made structures, and change detection); and intuitive visualization of the integrated data and derived information.

"The proposed research will continue work in progress and initiate new lines of inquiry concerning hormonal control of pituitary and gonadal function, using goldfish as primary experimental model. Emphasis is placed on integrated control of reproduction involving brain-pituitary-gonadal axis as well as autocrine/ paracrine regulation of gonadal development and differentiation in goldfish. The main objectives are: 

     1) Neuroendocrine regulation of gonadotropin (GTH) and growth hormone (GH) production in the goldfish pituitary. Emphasis is placed on gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), gonadal steroids, and hypothalamic RFamide-related family of peptides that inhibit GTH production. We propose to fully investigate functional characterization of RFamides and their receptors in the pituitary and extrapituitary and  their interaction with GnRH and gonadal steroids. 

    2) We continue testing the main hypothesis that GnRH plays a role in autocrine/paracrine regulation of gonadal function in goldfish. Emphasis is placed on the regulation of genes involved in early ovarian and testicular development and differentiation and their interaction with locally produced GnRH and steroids. 

    3) Sex steroids play critical role in the regulation of pituitary and gonadal function. It is therefore important to elucidate structural and functional characterization of nuclear receptors that mediate actions of estrogen, androgen, and thyroid hormones. The objective of the proposed study is to investigate the regulation and functional significance of novel nuclear receptor forms discovered recently in my laboratory.

"Interaction between light and matter can be tuned, enhanced or inhibited by controlling the characteristic of a material on a small enough scale. When a material is periodically textured on a scale comparable to the wavelength of light, resonant scattering leads to strong dispersion and the appearance of photonic band gaps. When the scale of texturing is further reduced to the nanometer scale, quantum-size effects modify electronic states and the optical properties of the material itself, as can be seen in quantum wells, wires and dots. Considering the range of possibilities textured materials and nanomaterials offer (commercial, scientific or otherwise), it is understandable that this area of research is currently very active, and probably will be for the next decade. With this in mind, the research proposal will focus on two areas: 1) nanomaterials for optical applications and 2) novel optical methods and instruments to characterize materials.





The first half of the program is to study laser-induced enhancement of some material properties embedded in periodic media. Photochromism is a property of some materials, such as MoO3 and WO3, that allows one to control their optical absorption by exposure to light. Thermochromism is the equivalent process where heat is the modifying agent (although heat can be created optically). The interaction between light and thermo- or photochromic materials is altered when they are embedded in a periodic structure. When light propagates through the periodic medium, its electric field may be enhanced, diminished or unaltered, depending on its frequency relative to the Bragg resonance. The goal is to study the interplay between the photochromic effect and the photonic band gap. We have done preliminary testing on SiO2/MoO3 multilayers and have found photochromism enhancement by a factor of >50 near the photonic band gap. We will extend our study to 3D structures as well as for thermochromic materials. Much remains to be done, since the theory for this combined effect doesn't exist and experiments are scarce. Photo- and thermochromism in periodic media is interesting for many reasons. While they are processes that are comparatively slow in relation to many nonlinear phenomena, they have the advantage of requiring extremely low light levels, which is desirable for some applications. 



The second half of the program deals with new optical techniques for measuring  the thermal properties of materials on extremely low volumes. It involves thermal lensing, a self-induced effect that occurs when a laser beam travels through an absorbent medium. In 2003, the applicant and its research group revealed a new type of lensing that works in reflection, as opposed to transmission as it is in standard techniques. A laser beam focused on an absorbent surface can create a nanometer-scale thermal bump that causes the reflected beam to diffract slightly. The time-evolution of this thermal bump provides information about the thermal conductivity of the substrate underneath. A patent was filed in 2008 and the applicant teamed up with C-Therm Technologies Ltd, a Fredericton-based thermal instrument company, to further research and develop a new commercial product. The optical technique is appealing because it is applicable to both opaque and transparent materials. Because it uses a tightly focused laser beam, only a small region near the surface is probed, and the volume of material necessary is reduced by a factor of 10E6 compared to standard techniques. This is interesting for probing small samples, like droplets, colloids, thin films, emulsions and even powders, a form of material of utmost importance to the pharmaceutical and food industries. The next 5 years will see further research and development in partnership with industry to bring the instrument to completion.

"Xylem is the principal tissue for water flow in land plants and as such it is a primary determinant of a plant's ability to survive in its environment. Xylem conduits should maximize conductivity while protecting the transpiration stream from air entry (cavitation) and maintaining the negative pressures required for water transport. Cavitation leads to air embolism (blockage) of xylem conduits. The result is a reduction in hydraulic conductivity, further exacerbating plant water stress. We will conduct experiments designed to learn more about the mechanism of water-stress-induced cavitation and how air-seeding is influenced by physiological factors, wood anatomy and environment. 



We will also continue our efforts of linking xylem anatomy with cavitation resistance and hydraulic conductivity. Species representing different xylem anatomies will be collected in Canada and abroad to test if and how cavitation resistance is affected by the tissue surrounding the vessels. 



Studying the hydraulics and morphology of roots represents another research focus. Much of the total hydraulic resistance to water flow is thought to occur below-ground. We will study diurnal and seasonal changes in root conductivity in conifers and angiosperm trees that are native to the boreal forest in Alberta. Hydraulic measurements and cryo-SEM will show if roots are undergoing daily and seasonal cycles of embolism and refilling and how such changes agree with patterns of stomatal conductance.

"Ore and waste handling in most underground mines is based on a network of vertical or steeply inclined ore and waste passes. An ore pass is comprised by a number of sections of different length. A section is defined as a segment of an ore pass that links two levels and excavated in one run. Although it is typical to observe changes in orientation from a section to another, this is not necessary. Material transfer is an integral part of the mining process; with rock pass related problems resulting in operational and economic significance. Operational concerns include hang-ups due to arching of material, blockage and degradation of the rock pass. Ore passes that require rehabilitation or intervention to liberate blockages (hang-up) may pose safety concerns for the work force.



There are two basic objectives in this research. The first aims to improve our design capabilities for ore passes using empirical data. In this respect access to a mature mine such as Brunswick provides more information for data. The other objective aims to develop sophisticated models that will allow for a better understanding of the interaction between stress and structure and how they influence the longevity and performance of ore pass systems. 



a) To assess the performance of ore pass systems at Xstrata's Brunswick Mine by developing a comprehensive database. Such a database will illustrate the successes as well as the areas were problems were encountered.

b) To monitor and document the behaviour of ore pass systems currently in operation at Brunswick. Mine.

c) To develop modeling and empirical tools to control and predict the performance of ore pass systems over time.  This knowledge can be used to improve the design process at Brunswick but more importantly to other hard rock underground mines that employ ore pass systems for material transfer.

d) Investigate the interaction of structure and stress in ore pass systems by linking fracture system and particle flow tools.



This research will advance Canadian expertise in the design, operation and maintenance of orepass systems, and establish Canada as the international leader in ore pass design.

"We will investigate the role of a protein called terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) in generation of antiviral CD8+ T cell responses. CD8+ T cells comprise an important line of defense against disease-causing viruses. They recognize viral antigens (i.e., molecules considered by the immune system as foreign) and convert to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) capable of eliminating virus-infected cells. It is well known that mammalian T cell repertoire consists of a huge number of CTL precursors, each bearing a ""pre-made"" antigen receptor of unique specificity. The diversity of T cell repertoire results from the function of several key molecules including TdT during T cell development in the thymus. Although viral propagation inside host cells generates thousands of virus-derived peptides and despite the fact that adult T cell pools contain CTL precursors specific for many (if not all) of these peptides, only a limited number of CTL clones rise to the task of detecting viral antigens and combating viral invaders. The magnitude of responses among these few clones varies to a great extent, leading to the establishment of a conserved hierarchy among them. This phenomenon is called immunodominance. Many consider immunodominance an obstacle to successful immune responses targeting as many antigenic sites as possible. It is therefore important to understand how immunodominance hierarchies are shaped. While several factors vis-�-vis peptide generation within host cells have been shown to contribute to immunodominance, only little is known about the relationship between early T cell development in the thymus and dominance hierarchies of CTLs induced in response to viruses encountered later in life. Our preliminary data point to a role for TdT as a missing link between the two phases. We will use modern cellular and molecular techniques and multiple model systems to reveal the importance of TdT in dictating dominance hierarchies of virus-specific T cells. The findings of this study are expected to advance our understanding of CD8+ T cell biology and immunodominance and to introduce a novel biological function for TdT beyond its well-established role during T cell development.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Cell Biology"

"There are many emerging wireless concepts and applications, where radio nodes of different sizes and capabilities are deployed under variable conditions. Also, the fast growth in the number of wireless systems deployed in a city or along a road will create an unpredictable interference environment. Since many of the new applications envisage using miniature radio devices with one or multiple antennas, it is important to develop new concepts that allow such devices to function with reasonable reliability under a wide range of conditions. The key is to build into the node enough flexibility in order to be able to adapt its communication parameters to the surrounding environment.  The proposed research focuses on four aspects of ad-hoc wireless communications. The first aspect is to model and characterize the pathloss and scattering properties of randomly deployed radios in a realistic way.  We plan to measure the signal strength and power delay profiles of the channels under different conditions.  The second aspect is to characterize the relation between the transmission bandwidth, the propagation environment. Distance and density of deployment, data transfer capability and the life time of the node. The third aspect is to design, simulate and test new concepts that allow a small node to adapt to its environment in order to maintain reliable communications.  The fourth aspect is to propose innovative methodologies to enhance the reliability of and health of the network.  Measurement-based propagation modelling will provide an insight into ways to create an adaptive structure for the wireless node. In particular, we are aiming at examining the role of antennas and adaptive filters as ways to build robustness. Finally, we aim to examine our models against real-life applications such as the conditions encountered in monitoring large areas for safety, security or for monitoring the quality of air and water.

"This research is based on the adage that 'dose makes the poison'.  Dose is not accurately quantified by measuring average concentrations of a chemical in the environment, but by predicting the probability of a 'hot' exposure.  For chemical exposures associated with food such as fish, we need to know what factors and processes that make some fish more contaminated than others.  This variability of contaminant concentrations within and among fish species is also of ecological importance for this variability can provide insight into food web function and structure.  Therefore this research is critical to both ecotoxicology and aquatic ecology.  We aim to integrate toxicokinetic modeling with food web models in order to produce non-steady state food web models that explain and predict the temporal variability of contaminant concentrations in aquatic food webs.

The goal of this proposal will be achieved through a series of projects that will calibrate and verify the use of this new modeling approach.",Environment,"Evolution & Ecology"

"Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) consist of stationary wireless routers interconnected by wireless links with a small fraction acting as gateways to the Internet via wired (e.g., Ethernet) or wireless (e.g., WIMAX) links. One of the key challenges facing WMNs is supporting high throughput. The maximum available bandwidth degrades rapidly with increasing distance between the source and destination in the mesh network (i.e., the number of wireless routers traversed between the mobile device and the gateway to the Internet); this degradation is caused due to interference from neighboring hops and paths. For example, in a network with identical and omnidirectional radio ranges, going from a single hop to two hops halves the throughput of a flow. This can be disastrous for network providers eying to provide the level of latency/throughput people are accustomed to with their wired networks.

The capacity of WMNs can be increased using multi-radio nodes with multiple (orthogonal) channels; also, with careful adaptation of transmission power of wireless routers, one can minimize interferences and thus increase the capacity. In this project we intend to (a) develop new ""unified"" models and tools for the design of WMNs with the primary goal of increasing the capacity of WMNs; the uniqueness of our proposal lies in the fact that rather than treating each of the components (e.g., multi-channel, power control, cost, etc.) separately, as has been done so far in the literature, we will address the above issues using a unified approach by exploiting the intimate relationship among them; and (b) develop new policy-based adaptive management schemes to provide QoS support and assurance for different classes of users. The basic novel idea behind these schemes is to react to anomalies (e.g., failure and congestion) by reconfiguring (e.g., new channel assignment, new topology) the WMN while minimizing, ideally avoiding, the impact on the ongoing traffic.

"Advances in vehicular networking technology enable novel safety, information, and entertainment applications, such as early warning of hazards, vehicular traffic information, and video streaming and Internet access. Vehicular networks consist of a number of vehicles (equipped with one or more wireless interfaces) traveling on streets/highways, capable of communicating with each other. There are three possible configurations of vehicular networks: a pure wireless ad-hoc network, wireless infrastructure, or a hybrid/integrated architecture combining the two. In the open literature, little work has been done to investigate (1) the design of the vehicular wireless infrastructure; indeed, most existing related research considers only the problem of transmitting data between vehicles and roadside APs; and (2) Quality of Service (QoS) support/assurance to support different classes of traffic while taking into account the severe fluctuation of resources in vehicular networks and the instantaneous capacity variation.

In this project, we consider hybrid configurations that use vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications; this infrastructure consists of wireless base stations (e.g., WIFI, WIMAX, 3G) and relays.  We plan to (1) develop novel optimization models to design the vehicular network wireless infrastructure taking into account the special characteristics of vehicular networks; the objective is to design a wireless infrastructure that supports the expected vehicular traffic with a least cost while guaranteeing QoS. Heuristics/meta-heuristics will be defined for the resolution of the design models; and (2) develop adaptive management schemes to provide QoS assurance to different classes of applications/services; the objective is to protect high priority traffic (e.g. a car crash warning) by not admitting or even preempting/degrading lower priority traffic in case of congestion. Due to the severe fluctuation of resources in vehicular networks, the instantaneous capacity varies leading to QoS fluctuations. We will develop a distributed admission control which could learn from its environment and adapt to such fluctuations.

"On the one hand, concerns about occupants' health, comfort, energy consumption and environment are becoming a main design consideration for ventilation systems, and on the other hand, threats to public safety and security cannot be overlooked and need to be taken into consideration. The sudden release of chemical and biological agents can pose a safety and security threat to public buildings and can cause injuries and loss of life. Recently air cleaner technology has been introduced for air sterilization and purification in industrial buildings and hospitals due to its long life, functionality and sustainability. However this technology has not been applied to the non-industrial built environment in general, and the possibility of a sudden release of chemical and biological agents in particular has not been addressed. In this scenario the effectiveness of the cleaning system strongly depends on the location of release, the type of air cleaner device, type of contaminant, as well as several other parameters. The long-term objective of the proposed study is to establish a multidisciplinary research team that will focus on the research and development of air cleaning and air purification devices, new sensors, control strategies, and guidelines for design of immune buildings. The short-term objectives that are to be achieved over the next three years, for which financial support is requested, are: 1) Develop a set of methodologies to evaluate the performance of promising air purification and sterilization devices; chemical anc biological, 2)Develop design simulation tools to predict the performance of these devices in case of an intentional or unintentional release scenario, and 3)Develop new devices and/or improve the performance of existing ones. This research will develop the knowledge and advance the technology of air purification and sterilization devices that can neutralize the spread of chemical and biological agents through air distribution systems and will assist in developing the appropriate standards. When completed, this work will help in developing an effective response to save lives by providing critical information to building managers and emergency response teams.",Environment,"Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Safety and Security"
"The quantity of the outdoor air brought into the building can have a direct negative effect on the energy cost of ventilation and the climate. There is a cost to heat, cool, humidify or dehumidify the outdoor air depending on the location and season. This leads to a balancing act between indoor air quality (IAQ) and energy cost. The need for good IAQ, high energy cost, poor outdoor air quality and the risk of a chemical release have all increased the need and interest in systems to filter gaseous contaminants from the air. There are the traditional systems for filtering gases, activated carbon and/or potassium permanganate alumina pellets in trays or deep

beds. There are new technologies, UV, UV with catalyst, ion generating tubes, particulate filters incorporating very thin beds of activated carbon or alumina pellets, and carbon cloth, becoming available that also claim to filter the air of gaseous contaminants. 

As more such devices enter the market, it would be essential to develop a method for comparing their effectiveness. Presently, no such standard exists to determine the performance of ultra-violet photo-catalyst oxidation (UV-PCO) with respect to gas phase contaminants. The following short-term objectives are to be

achieved over the next five years, for which financial support is requested: 1) Identify the capacities of existing UV-PCO devices in removing various contaminants in the range of conditions experienced in typical buildings, 2) Investigate the effects of catalytic deactivation of UV-PCO devices on its long-term performance, 3)

Develop accelerated test protocol to evaluate the performance of UV-PCO devices, and its applicability in predicting the device's long term potential for air purification, and 4) Develop design simulation tools to predict the performance of UV-based photo-catalytic oxidation devices. 

The project will greatly benefit from the alliance with industrial partners (Dectron), and will contribute to the development of original expertise and research facilities in Canada.

"The goal of this proposal is to measure the masses of more than three dozen stars with a precision of 1%.  Precise masses of stars are difficult to obtain from single stars, and so normally this is done using eclipsing binary systems.  We propose to derive stellar masses with comparable (and in some cases, better) accuracies using non-eclipsing binary targets, increasing the number of available stars by a factor of 100 compared to the current state of the art.  To do this, we will employ a new class of instrumentation, known as the dispersed Fourier Transform Spectrometer (dFTS), which was designed specifically for this task, and developed by our group.  Two versions of the dFTS were deployed while the project PI (Dr. Hajian) was employed in the US.  In January 2008, Dr. Hajian accepted a professorship at the University of Waterloo, and the dFTS hardware was no longer available.  Therefore, funding is requested to reconstruct the dFTS hardware package and install the instrumentation on a Canadian telescope (the 3.5m CFHT is the aperture of choice). dFTS hardware has been in continuous operation for the last six years.  The ensemble velocity precision required for our proposed plan to succeed is low (i.e. 250 m/s).   The single measurement precision of the dFTS for stars is much higher (i.e. between 2 and 50 m/s), resulting in a low risk for the proposed research plan.  We note that this project will yield significant benefits to the astronomical community in Canada.  It will enable graduate students and researchers at Canadian institutions to develop high-precision hardware, and to continue to ensure that Canada remains at the forefront of these and related activities.  In addition, there exists a possibility that our proposed research program will result in the detection of planets outside of our solar system, including planets as small as the Earth.  This would be a significant breakthrough in astrophysics, and has implications in virtually every aspect of society and culture.

"Mathematical models play an increasingly significant role in shaping our understanding of air pollution, and in identifying possible solutions for reducing it to acceptable levels. Scientists, regulators, and policymakers use air quality models to gain insight and make informed decisions about the quality of air and ways that it can be impacted by human activities. An important method that is often used for such purposes is sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis tools can provide answers to the main question with respect to air pollution: how air quality will be affected by changes in emissions? Sophisticated mathematical tools have been developed to calculate sensitivity information in air quality models. Some of these methods are source-based and provide detailed sensitivity information about emission sources. Others are receptor-based and are, therefore, deemed to be ideal for addressing policy questions. In this project, the goal is to develop one group of such receptor-based tools, referred to as an adjoint, for a widely used air quality model. It is intended to use the developed adjoint model for various applications that include: 1) improved air quality forecasting, 2) developing better estimation of emission inventories that are used in the models, 3) design of optimal pollution control strategies for reaching air quality objectives and cost-benefit analysis, and 4) quantitative evaluation of inter-provincial, trans-border, and intercontinental transport of pollution.

"Arctic sea-ice is disappearing rapidly, this is going to have a profound impact on global climate, carbon cycling and sequestration calculations, and biological and human systems, particularly in the Arctic and on the continental shelf. The processes that dictate the atmosphere-ocean cycling of CO2 in sea-ice dominated environments are not well understood and constitute a critical gap in our understanding of the global carbon cycle. Uptake by polar seas is thought to be 2-3 times higher than the global ocean average where high rates of uptake are attributed to seasonal algal blooms in cold nutrient rich water and brine-driven convection associated with rapid ice formation.  This process allows for carbon taken in at the surface to be transported to the deep ocean.  ""Frost flowers"" growing on first year sea-ice are significantly mineralized; they contain CaCO3 (often as ikaite). Using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry we will analyze the mineral content of the ice inclusions in situ and at different depths in ice cores.  We expect to establish the 1) source of the major elements making up the mineral inclusions; 2) establish the sequence of mineral development and compositional evolution of the inclusion system at different depths in the ice; 3) relate composition and age to assess the effectiveness of the pumping model in different thicknesses of ice; and 3) test whether inclusion assemblages (including trace elements) trace elements can be used to source the sea-ice geographically.   A parallel study will model elemental exchange in experimentally grown sea-ice and in Prairie saline lakes, which have remarkably similar ecology and mineralogy. It is crucial that we provide the best estimates we can for mass balance(s) involving carbon fluxes in the Arctic sea-ice system.   The mineralogical content of sea ice has essentially gone unaccounted in this system. Without the mineralogical data our estimates of CO2 and Ca cycling will be wrong.

"Diet is the main exposure route to cadmium (Cd) for non-smoking Canadians; cadmium is a suspected human carcinogen and cause of renal dysfunction.  Foods from oilseeds and grains are a significant dietary source (shellfish and potatoes are other dietary sources), as Cd is present in agricultural soils as a result of geogenic sources, agricultural practices, and deposition from the atmosphere.  Predicting the concentration of Cd that would be expected from a particular soil concentration of Cd would be useful to agricultural producers.  Several models for estimating the bioavailable fraction of total cationic metals in soils are in use.  However, it is recognized that this approach is limited by the largely unquantified, additional influence of plant specific factors and meteorological effects on transport of Cd from bulk soil into soil solution, and finally into the seeds of the crops.  The proposed field work will survey paired soils and soybeans across Ontario, and coupled with meteorological data, will define the contribution of evapotranspiratory demand and bioavailable Cd in soil, to Cd accumulation in the plants.  Companion laboratory work will identify the potential for different varieties of soybean (high- and low-seed Cd accumulators) to enhance the bioavailability of Cd through root processes such as acidification of the root environment. The work will conclude with the development of a Best Management Practice suitable for use by both agricultural producers and regulators, to understand the science bases and the options for mitigation, of Cd accumulation in field crops.  A public interest group (Environmental Defence, www.environmentaldefence.ca) has recently used diet survey data from Health Canada to demonstrate that dietary exposure to Cd of young Canadians exceeds the ""no effects"" threshold.  So, there are concerns about food safety among consumers, as elevated body burdens of Cd are linked to kidney dysfunction and osteoporosis particularly in sub-populations with less than optimal nutrition. The benefit to the Ontario Food Safety System will be the development of a process-based understanding that will be useful for pre-emptive management of, or response to, this emerging issue.","Pollutants and toxic agents (waste, use 902)","Plant Biology & Food Science"

"Stress hormones have the capacity to enhance or disrupt the brain's capacity to form new memories, especially under conditions of emotional arousal. Over the past few decades, there has been much progress in our understanding of age-related changes in memory, and, more recently, in the neural correlates of memory development. In contrast, there is sparse knowledge about how stress hormones affect memory in infants or about the hormonal correlates of memory development. My research program addresses these gaps by investigating the relationship between stress and memory in the first year of life. I use age-appropriate methods to study stress, emotion, and memory using a research design that differentiates the effects of stress on specific stages of memory (i.e., encoding, consolidation, and retrieval). I am testing the hypothesis that moderate induced stress enhances memory. I am also examining the role of emotional and autonomic arousal in learning and memory by testing the hypothesis that more frequent expressions of anger rather than sadness during stress is associated with a pattern of stress reactivity that enhances learning and memory. Another question that my research program addresses is sex differences in the relationship between stress and memory. Based on animal studies, I am testing the hypothesis that the impact of stress on memory differs in boys and girls. Finally, I am evaluating normal developmental changes in stress hormones over the first year in order to determine whether these changes predict memory performance. I am testing the hypothesis that there will be a developmental decline in basal cortisol levels from 3 to 6 to 9 months, and that a greater developmental decline in basal stress hormones will be related to better memory performance. This novel approach to the study of stress in infants is advancing our understanding of how stress affects cognition, and it offers critical insight into how infant's ability to regulate stress affects their ability to remember what they have learned. This research program will significantly enhance our knowledge of the role of stress in memory during infancy, thus laying crucial groundwork for evidence-based practices in pediatric health care, parenting, and early education.

"""Climate"" is defined as the statistics of weather, and is often quantified for things like monthly averaged temperature and precipitation. While climate has often seemed random and unpredictable, recent advances in climate science point to regularly occurring patterns that impose some order on the climate system. The El Ni�o, for instance, is the best known ""natural pattern"" of Earth's climate. This and other climate patterns have characteristic signatures in seasonally changing patterns of wind, air temperature, and precipitation; each pattern also has a typical life time for any given ""event"". Climate models attempt to predict these patterns and typical life times. Reliable climate models require long-term and high-resolution records of past environmental conditions from different settings. Such data can enable climate forecasts and estimate the human impact on climate. However, instrumental records of environmental variables are limited. This is especially true for mid- and higher latitude oceans, where multicentury reconstructions of intraannual and seasonal marine climate variability are scarce. High-resolution paleoclimate data from these regions are essential as input for global climate models, and necessary in order to distinguish natural and anthropogenically induced climate variability. My research is therefore aimed at generating and interpreting multicentury climate records using geologic climate archives. This proposal will focus on the extraction of climate information from coralline red algae. Coralline red algae, which live in shallow seas, are well suited as recorders of past climates outside the tropics because they (1) are widely distributed in extratropical oceans, (2) are long-lived, and (3) display annual growth increments (similar to tree rings) in a calcified skeleton. Over the next five years I plan to generate multicentury climate reconstructions from the Bering Sea and Northwestern Atlantic- two key regions where poorly understood climate and ecosystem changes have recently had a dramatic impact on fishery yields. The climate reconstructions are expected to yield information on past climate variability, strength and frequency of climate oscillations, and aid in predicting future climate evolution.

"Anthropogenic emissions of inorganic mercury (HgII) have increased long-range transport of Hg and pollution of remote pristine areas.  On a global basis, the major sources of Hg to the atmosphere are emissions from coal-fired energy production and waste combustion, fluxes that are likely to increase with further industrialization and population growth.  In general, HgII in the atmosphere enters aquatic ecosystems where it can be converted though microbial methylation into methylmercury (MeHg).  MeHg concentrations in the environment are of special concern because MeHg is a neurotoxin that is easily bioaccumulated by humans and wildlife that consume fish and other aquatic organisms.

The current RTI proposal requests funds to purchase a system to allow us to expand our analytical techniques to low-level MeHg analysis, allowing us to measure the highly neurotoxic, bioaccumulated form of Hg independently from other less harmful inorganic Hg species in environmental samples.  The system is capable of analyzing MeHg in a variety of environmental matrices, including air, plants, biota, water, and sediment.  MeHg is detected using a combination of dual stage pre-concentration and atomic fluorescence detection, after distillation, ethylation, and GC separation.  This provides the most sensitive, selective, and resilient MeHg analysis available to date.  The method of analysis is not automated and as a result there are a number of components that are required.  These components include equipment for the purification of samples by distillation, and the ethylation, separation by gas chromatography, and detection using cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectrometry.

"In addition to their well-characterized functions of antigen recognition for destruction of specific targets through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), numerous antibodies, termed Abzymes, have been found to possess catalytic abilities such as hydrolysis of nucleotides, proteins, and polysaccharides, phosphorylation of proteins and lipids, and generation of free radicals. We have found that a monoclonal antibody (mAb), namely anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa O6ad lipopolysaccaride (LPS) IgG1, and its recombinant antibody (rAb) fragments (Fab and scFv) exhibit cytotoxic activities against their specific target bacterium independent of ADCC and CDC. Our preliminary unpublished data indicate that this mAb has co-evolved two functions onto one molecule: specific binding to the surface of a pathogen, and the ability to kill it per se. We propose a five-year research program to test the hypothesis that this mAb and its fragments are catalytic in nature, and to elucidate the specific killing mechanism through experimentation involving biochemical, molecular, physiological, structural, analytic, immunological, genetic, and pharmacological techniques. We will also search for other antibodies with specific bactericidal characteristics, and to compare killing mechanisms for further understanding of this phenomenon. It is anticipated that research outcomes will result in greater understanding a novel mechanism of cytotoxicity with tremendous potential for further development of applications in medicine and health.

"Progress  in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry relies extensively on the availability and rapid access to novel small molecules of high purity.  In response to these demands, modern techniques such as combinatorial chemistry and microwave chemistry have been developed in order to accelerate and facilitate the purification of novel organic compounds.  In 2004, our Department created a dedicated laboratory for combinatorial synthesis.  This modern laboratory supports researchers in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.  To produce large collections of small molecules, this facility requires a chain of instrumentation, all of which must be in good order in order to avoid delays.  The current rapid evaporator employed to quickly evaporate samples after synthesis and chromatographic purification has been used extensively for more than ten years.  This unit needs replacement as it was recently diagnosed with a non-repairable defect.  It leaks refrigerant gas at a rate requiring refills every 3 months.  This situation is costly and environmentally unacceptable.  To maintain the facility's productivity and avoid any delays in our ongoing medicinal chemistry collaborations with several biological scientists, we request funding for the purchase of a new rapid evaporator. Very promising anti-cancer lead compounds have been identified in our facility, and this new evaporator will allow the continuous generation of improved libraries and analogues with no delays.

"    )	    )	It is important that humankind better understand the Earth system, so that policy makers can develop suitable, long-term social and economic strategies to deal with various environmental issues, including global change. This is an interdisciplinary project to study the linkages between climate and solid Earth dynamics, in the evolution of plateaux in mountain belts. These are driven by the tectonics of colliding plates, but local climate modifies the rising surface through erosion, transport and deposition.  In turn, the evolving mountain belt may affect global climate.  Orogenic plateaux are high plains within mountain belts, which result in, and are modified by, local climatic variations (rain-shadows, for instance). Young orogenic plateaux, which preserve a rock record of their evolution, offer a special opportunity to enhance our understanding of the essential linkage between surface and deeper processes, and model them.  

    )	The Central Anatolian Plateau, in southern Turkey, lies above an active convergent plate margin, where the African and Anatolian plates meet.  Continental collision is just starting, and we hypothesize that the collision is responsible for the uplift of the Plateau.  This new project involves onland studies of the Plateau uplift, complemented by studies of corresponding subsidence in adjacent offshore basins, together with seismic surveys to determine crustal structure of the active plate margin, and geodynamic modeling integrating all the information. 

    )	The Canadian team will play a pivotal role in the marine component of this research: a high-resolution seismic reflection survey of the G�ksu delta, a major local sediment sink, in the eastern Mediterranean, in May 2008; and a wide-angle crustal seismic survey from the African plate to the Central Anatolian Plateau on the Anatolian plate, planned for August 2009.  We seek funding for the surveys (already scheduled by our partners) and the follow-up data processing, modelling and interpretation. Our requested contribution from NSERC will leverage over 6 times as much funding from our European partners.

"    )	When the tectonic plates of Earth's surface collide, or are pulled apart, they create deep depressions (that usually fill with sediments) and/or high mountains. This program is about imaging (by advanced echo sounding) and interpreting plate tectonic processes as they occur, or shortly afterwards, in two contrasted areas.

    )	The first is the continental edge of Atlantic Canada, which formed by extension and seafloor spreading over 100 million years ago (not long, geologically). This edge preserves a geological record of the events, and hosts significant hydrocarbons. The Newfoundland margin and its Iberian conjugate form a well-studied pair with unusually wide (>100 km) continent-ocean transitions. Recent drilling of the Newfoundland margin found exhumed mantle material, matching similar rocks discovered on the conjugate. Earlier ideas of asymmetrical extension need to be revised! Processing and interpretation of additional seismic data will enable us to delineate the sedimentary basins and transition zones more clearly, and to reconstruct how the margin formed.

The second area is the presently-active Cyprus arc in the eastern Mediterranean, which is in transition from subduction to continental collision. Our recent work has documented changing patterns of basin sedimentation and deformation as the convergence direction rotated 45 degrees in the last 15 million years. Now, the intention is to acquire, process and interpret 4000 km of seismic reflection data, at the junction of the Cyprus and Hellenic arcs. Arc junctions are very dynamic plate corners, often the sites of extreme surface relief (e.g., the 5-km deep Rhodes Basin), but poorly understood. These data will provide new insights into the history of this particular corner and, by generalization, into one of the least well-understood aspects of plate interactions.

    )	The mechanics of these processes underpin attempts to reduce the natural hazards they pose, and to exploit the resources they may contain. So this research will aid geologists interested in fundamental plate processes, those involved in coping with geological hazards, and those searching for hydrocarbon energy resources.

"Despite our fascination with the diversity of forms observed in flowering plants, our understanding of how this variation has arisen is limited.  The goal of my research is to better understand the mechanisms underlying differences in two key traits: fruit structure and floral symmetry.  A group within the mustard family, called the Brassiceae, is important because it includes crop species (e.g. canola, broccoli) and because the fruits are often segmented, a trait that dramatically alters how their seeds are dispersed.  The increasing importance of seed dispersal in crop plants and controlling the gene flow in genetically modified crop systems, and the increasing prevalence of introduced species in natural ecosystems, necessitate a detailed knowledge of fruit developmental genetics and evolution.  Species in the caper family reveal an impressive variation in floral form, including many changes in floral symmetry.  This trait has a significant impact on pollinator interactions including promoting speciation and diversification. 



Ultimately, we would like to know how changes in gene regulation have lead to morphology differences - a key question in biology.  We take a comprehensive approach that includes: (1) using DNA variation to elucidate relationships among morphologically distinct plants in order to understand transitions in form, (2) conducting detail developmental studies on a range of species to determine developmental patterns, (3) using molecular dating to determine the evolutionary timing of events, and (4) conducting genetic studies to examine how differences in gene expression may lead to morphological variation.  The two groups that I focus on, the Brassiceae and the capers, are both closely related to the genetic plant model, Arabidopsis, which will greatly facilitate genetic studies. Surprisingly, these groups have largely been overlooked with regards to improving our understanding of morphological diversity surrounding this important genetic model.

at all points in a plane. This is extremely useful for studying, for example, the behaviour of complicated

turbulence phenomena. To perform PIV, a flow is seeded with tiny particles (like smoke) and illuminated using

a powerful laser. Successive images of the flow are captured using a high speed camera and compared using

particle tracking algorithms to yield a full array of velocity vectors throughout the flow field. The final, out of

plane velocity component can be resolved using an additional camera; this technique is known as Stereoscopic

PIV. UNB already has a state-of-the-art planar PIV system in place, so we are are requesting one additional

"Turbulence research is of the greatest practical importance; Holmes et al. (2002) suggested that ''turbulence is responsible for the vast majority of human energy consumption, in aircraft fuel, pipeline pumping charges, and so forth."" However, despite its widespread relevance, the equation set describing turbulent flows is not closed and the prediction of phenomena associated with turbulence, such as drag and heat transfer, remains difficult. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a commonly used tool for predicting the behaviour of turbulent flows. Unfortunately, the majority of the codes have been formulated for two-dimensional mean flows and often yield unsatisfactory results in flows with even mild three-dimensionality. This is often due to inability of most models to accurately account for the generation of secondary flow due to the directional nature of the turbulence. For example, the turbulent three-dimensional wall jet is a flow that is characterized by strong secondary flows and consequently, conventional turbulence models are unable to predict the growth of three-dimensional wall jets to within 50%. This is particularly problematic given the frequent occurrence of three-dimensional wall jets in engineering problems (i.e. Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, effluent discharge, film cooling, airfoil design, electronics cooling, combustion applications and cooling the outer surfaces of high speed re-entry vehicles and rockets).  The present research examines the turbulence in the three dimensional wall jet in the hopes of improving our understanding of turbulence generated secondary flow and its relationship to the organized vortical motions in the flow.

"Over the last few years, researchers around the world have been pursuing a new direction for high-performance semiconductor technologies, including lasers, photonic devices, electronic logic, and even new computers using quantum information, that would all operate based on a quantum mechanical property of the electron called ""spin"".  By virtue of this spin property, an electron acts as a tiny magnet, and spin-based semiconductor devices will work by controlling the magnet's direction.  Since it takes significantly less energy to flip the electron spin direction than to physically move electrons around in semiconductors using their electrostatic charge, transistor logic based on spin would have much lower power consumption than traditional charge-based logic devices.  A new class of semiconductors doped with magnetic impurities are now being developed in which electron spins can be aligned at will and controlled using light.  These materials could allow logic and memory functions in our computers to be integrated, leading to a drastic simplification in the way that computers are built.  Semiconductor quantum dots, which are tiny nanometer-sized pieces of one type of semiconductor embedded in another, provide us with a convenient way to isolate a single electron.  In the future, the spins of electrons trapped in arrays of quantum dots may allow us to develop new highly-secure communication systems based on quantum information.  The proposed funding will support research into novel semiconductor materials, including magnetic semiconductors and quantum dots, that show great promise for applications in the areas of spin-based semiconductor logic, photonics and quantum information.  These materials will be studied using a special laser that produces short bursts of light.  These pulses of light can be used to control the spin direction and to ""read-out"" this direction with extremely high time resolution. This world-class research program will promote growth of the high technology industry in Canada by providing the intellectual foundation and highly-skilled researchers and technicians for the development of cutting-edge spin-based technologies.

"Transgenic crops with tolerance to abiotic stress and novel crops offer solutions to increased production and bioproduct innovation. There is global concern that these crops may be invasive of natural areas and cause economic and environmental damage. At this time, there is no established method to assess invasiveness prior to release of new crops.



With the support of BIOTECanada and CFIA, we will hold a workshop to predict invasiveness of novel crops. The workshop will bring together funders, regulators and weed and invasive species researchers to develop a research plan based on a demographic modeling approach. This is an approach has been used successfully in conservation biology. A demographic modeling approach may provide an easily interpretable metric for population increase that can be compared between species, between environments and scalable, from growth chamber facilities to large scale research plots. 



The workshop will develop a common framework by bringing into Canada scientists with demographic modeling experience, define clear hypothesis and methods of testing, identify key research skills important for completion, engineer the communication of the group and build a scalable research plan, and develop reporting and management systems. 



The outcome will be a new collaborative research group with strong links to industry and regulatory authorities to solve a specific and important problem.

"Turbulent magnetic friction in an accretion disk of matter spiralling into a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy can cause the infalling matter to heat up and give off the light we see as an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Exactly how this process works is not understood, but various lines of argument do suggest that a wind launched from the accretion disk will carry away angular momentum and allow matter to fall into the black hole. These winds affect the formation and development of galaxies and distribute metal-enriched gas into intergalactic space. What is needed now is a detailed comparison of the optical and ultraviolet properties of thousands of AGN with wind model predictions. Knowing which kinds of winds reproduce the observations will help refine theoretical wind models and improve our ability to infer the fundamental physical parameters of AGN from their observable parameters. Better understanding of AGN winds will lead to better understanding of AGN and of how galaxies have been influenced by AGN feedback.



Another way to study AGN feedback is to assemble a large sample of galaxies with measurements of both central stellar bulge and black hole properties and study the connections between those properties. Together, the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey and spectroscopic surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey can provide such a sample.  The deep, high-resolution imaging of the CFHTLS enables separation of the light from many galaxies into the light from their stellar bulges, stellar disks, and active nuclei. Bulge luminosity is correlated with black hole mass in a relationship that can be calibrated using the width of emission lines from a galaxy's active nucleus. Combining the CFHTLS with publicly available spectroscopic surveys will enable the best study yet of the behavior of the black hole mass - bulge luminosity correlation over four orders of magnitude in black hole mass, setting important constraints on theoretical models of galaxy formation and AGN feedback.

"In many fields of low-energy physics, such as atomic and molecular physics, the fundamental equations are established, or at least agreed upon.  What it is often difficult is to say unambiguously what the implications of the theory are for specific physical systems. The problems are essentially mathematical or computational.    This research is principally to do with developing methods that can be used to reduce complexity and allow the problems to be solved to a satisfactory degree of accuracy.  Systems of identical particles in quantum mechanics obey a very powerful constraint: under the interchange of particles, the allowed states are either symmetric (bosons) or anti-symmetric (fermions).  A formulation can be devised which  is a dynamic analog of the crystallographic principle, that the crystal reproduces the shape of the molecular unit cell; dynamically, a many-particle quantum system behaves approximately like a special scaled version of a two-particle system.  Thus we can build many-body effects into the parameters of a representative model that is simple enough to be solved analytically.  Further simplifications are possible if the interaction potential is a smooth transformation of a potential for which exact solutions are already known.  This leads to representations in which the potential studied is an envelope curve of a family of previously-studied potentials.  Thus symmetry and geometry are used to effect computational simplifications, which ideally retain definite relationships between the original problem and the soluble model. The validity of these methods is often independent of the number of particles or the dimension of the space in which they move.  Fundamental questions naturally arise to do with the relation of one problem to another, so that new 'comparison theorems' are called for.  It is also an essential part of this work to develop computational techniques, both with exact computer algebra, and direct numerical analysis.  In one method under development, called the Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM), a computer program iterates a set of functions until an exact or approximate solution is reached.

"During a recent meeting with a senior executive of a major Canadian mining company the applicant was informed that their worldwide maintenance costs were 1.25 billion dollars.  Historically, mining has struggled to understand, model and change the parameters that influence their maintenance costs.   The applicant recently finished a one year sabbatical during which extensive time was spent working with the processing plant reliability group of a major oil sands company.   During this tenure it became apparent that there is limited and practically no models that describe the influence of plant operational parameters on plant equipment maintenance and reliability.  In fact this is true of mining process plants in general.  An interesting observation with regards to oil sands ithat it is the integration of two industries oil production and mining.  In your typical oil processing plant the operating environment is stable and they will run for years without major outages.   In a typical mining processing plant the equipment is subjected to a significantly  more dynamic operating environment and consequently a higher frequency of maintenance outages.   When you combine a mining environment with an oil processing plant the result is an extremely variable operating environment whith plant maintenance costs in excess of 1 billion dollars per year for three existing operations in Fort McMurray Alberta. 

Given the significance of maintenance costs to the mining industry and the general lack of understanding of the key influencing parameters, this research will focus on developing models and simulations to predict the influence of operational parameters on plant process equipment reliability.  To facilitate the research data from an oil sands operation will be used to develop the initial result and approach.  The approach will then be applied to a traditional mining operation.

"The goal of this project is to improve the laboratory infrastructure quality which in turn will enable researchers to achieve world recognizable results in the field of photonics devices design, help to train highly qualified personnel to gain knowledge required in IT industry, and to bring the Photonic Technology Laboratory (PTLab) to the world leading position in photonics research. The project enhances the discovery, innovation and training capability of University of Ottawa researchers in the natural sciences and provides a better opportunity to students for pursuing new ideas in the field of telecommunications. This project will apply coherent detection techniques in PON applications in order to increase network reach and capacity enhancement in the framework of a next generation of PON. Cost effectiveness, reliability and higher capacity of the PON makes it a prime candidate for delivering a number of services such as cable TV (CATV), telephony, video on demand, High Definition TV (HDTV) and online gaming to public or private users, compared to the traditional technologies such as Digital Subscriber Line Technology (xDSL). This research is innovative because the drive for higher performance in optical fiber systems has renewed interest in coherent detection. Ultimately, the coherent detection technique leads to optical symbol communication instead of traditional bit communication. Therefore, a larger number of customers can be handled with the less expensive electronic hardware. The purchase of a vector signal analyzer will provide researchers and students an excellent opportunity to evaluate the functionality of different subsystems in the PON link and will enable PTLab to lead in Canadian innovation. This in turn will benefit Canada as a whole, by introducing a low-cost optical access network with an extended range and the ability to cover remote locations where network deployment has been abandoned in the past due to high cost of deployment and maintenance. It has the potential to create greater availability and access to online services, incite development in fields such as tele-education and tele-medicine, as well as provide an increase in research opportunities and collaboration both nationally and worldwide.

"The goal of the proposed Discovery Grant research programme is to contribute to the realisation of ubiquitous and embedded photonic networks capable of supporting new applications that push bandwidth and accessibility limits. The expected results of this programme are: new photonic network architectures applicable from the chip-scale to the continental scale; new packet switch architectures that maximally exploit photonic technology by retaining data in the optical domain; new wired and wireless digital signal processing empowered coherent optical transmission systems to extend the capabilities of access networks and embedded networked sensors; and to develop critical enabling photonic device technologies exploiting the latest developments in nanotechnology and integration technology. The programme is innovative because it combines state-of-the-art novel network, architecture and systems concepts with device integration platforms that are amenable to the low-cost volume manufacture critical for widespread adoption of ubiquitous and embedded networks. The proposed research will contribute directly to providing broad-band access to all, which is now essential to the economic and social well-being of developed societies. Embedded optical wireless networked micro-sensors will contribute to improvements in quality of life and will provide additional opportunities for commercialisation. The research results will help position Canada as a world-leader in photonic network technology and will create an opportunity for Canada to establish a dominant position in an expanding sector of the world-wide marketplace. Equally important, the research will develop highly qualified and skilled personnel promoting effective knowledge transfer and helping to fill the employment needs of the industry.

"Although the vast majority of microbes remain uncultivated, they represent an almost limitless reservoir of genomic diversity and biological innovation. The development of screening tools to identify functional genes of interest from naturally occurring communities will allow us to access hidden enzymatic powers of uncultivated microbes and provide direct insight into the metabolic networks underlying fundamental biogeochemical processes.  The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is a good example of this paradigm. In anoxic sediments and water columns, AOM reduces methane flux from ocean to atmosphere, stimulates subsurface metabolism, and supports vigorous deep-sea chemolithotrophic communities that derive energy from one of its by-products, hydrogen sulfide. Despite its widespread significance, the molecular mechanisms underlying AOM are not well understood. This proposal is focused on reconstructing the metabolic pathways underlying methane oxidation, and determining the functional properties of enzymes associated with in situ methane turnover. This will be accomplished by combining traditional functional genomic and proteomic approaches with the development of novel analytic and molecular tools to explore complex community metabolism. The tools and methodologies arising from this research program are intended for general application in metagenomic research and will be readily transferable to a wide variety of environmental systems and functional targets. Building a mechanistic understanding of AOM will help shed light on the biochemistry of methane metabolism. These efforts could have practical benefits in the search for biological energy alternatives as we come to understand how various methane-oxidizing communities convert methane to molecular hydrogen or other reducing equivalents. The identification of novel enzymes that degrade aromatic hydrocarbons within AOM communities will have direct application to bioremediation practices. At the same time, these studies will provide new insight into alternative modes of energy utilization, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and cell survival in hydrocarbon-rich marine sediments.

"The photosynthetic bacteria are extremely metabolically versatile and serve as excellent model organisms for understanding a variety of basic biological processes including; nitrogen fixation, photosynthesis, and metabolic regulation.  We are presently concentrating on deciphering the role of ammonia and energy sensing in the regulation of nitrogenase in Rhodobacter capsulatus.  The survival and competiveness of microorganisms depend on their ability to sense and respond to the external milieu.  This is particularly evident with compounds that are metabolized to form the basic building blocks of the cell.  Nutrient-based regulation has been extensively studied with respect to transcriptional control, yet little is known about the direct sensing of nutrient availability.  

     We are investigating the role AmtB, a ubiquitous protein found in all realms of life, as an ammonium sensor.  This membrane protein is of general interest since it is found as an ammonia transporter in plants, and forms some of the mammalian Rh complexes.  Moreover, fungal Amts participate in signal transduction that leads to diploid pseudohyphal growth, or haploid invasive growth by pathogenic species.  Our studies have shown that it is necessary for communicating the presence of ammonium to the systems that carry out nitrogenase switch-off and ADP-ribosylation and appears to operate by forming a complex with GlnK, a PII protein.  In addition to further probing their roles in ammonia signalling using site-directed mutagenesis, measurement of relevant metabolite pools, and studying important protein-protein interactions, we will study their possible involvement in the regulation of dark microaerobic nitrogen fixation, and in mediating the nitrogenase regulatory response to darkness (energy deficit).

"When faced with a mathematical problem involving fractions, do children think about the problem conceptually, or do they instead work through a procedure to generate the ""right answer""? Results from research to date suggest varying answers to this question.  Different researchers have suggested that children learn concepts first, that they learn procedures first, and that they learn concepts and procedures in tandem.  This project builds upon a different finding that suggests that all of these might be true; these contradictory claims could be the result of individual differences in children's use of conceptual and procedural knowledge.  In other words, some children may rely more on conceptual understanding, some might rely more on procedural understanding, and others might equally rely on both. Building on this previous result, this research project will delve deeper into individual differences in children's conceptual and procedural knowledge in three main ways.  First, longitudinal and intervention studies will look at the progression of individual differences over time and how training in conceptual or procedural understanding can affect children with different conceptual and procedural profiles.  Second, additional studies will investigate whether the individual differences evident in fractions understanding will also be present in children's understanding of more complicated mathematical topics like algebra.  Third, this project will probe whether fraction's understanding can be helped or hindered by what other researchers have called people's ""number sense"".  All of these studies are meant to better understand how different young people think about fractions, and more complicated mathematical topics, and may result in better ways to focus teaching for these different kinds of learners.

"My research program involves examination of factors affecting the establishment, spread and population growth of invasive alien insect species in agricultural systems, including their life history traits and interactions with host plants. Invasive alien species represent a considerable threat to agricultural and natural ecosystems, impacting ecosystem integrity and causing major economic losses. The next phase of my research program will focus on several unexamined aspects of the population dynamics of the swede midge and interactions with its host plants. I first documented the presence of the swede midge in Ontario in 2000, and it has spread rapidly throughout Ontario and Quebec since then. This small fly feeds and develops on cruciferous plants and causes the formation of galls and malformation of leaf, stem and flowering tissues. High levels of infestation in Ontario have led to the complete loss of broccoli and canola harvests in some fields. Life history characteristics of the swede midge, such as the possible occurrence of multiple emergence phenotypes and prolonged diapause, may be significant factors in its success as an invasive species. These life history characteristics will be examined and their impact on potential population growth and geographic range expansion of the swede midge will be determined. Another aspect of this research program will be determining the process of gall formation, determining what factors are responsible for gall initiation, and for the first time documenting the morphological and physiological differences in gall development between host plants that are susceptible and resistant to swede midge infestation. This research will improve our ability to accurately predict swede midge population dynamics and may also lead to the development of resistant crop varieties, thus reducing pesticide use and facilitating the adoption of ecologically-sound pest management practices.

"In recent years, the cost of designing integrated circuits has dramatically increased due to exponentially larger circuits, an increase in circuit-level design challenges due to smaller transistors, and increased time-to-market pressures.  If it were not for the computer-aided design (CAD) innovations developed to date, the average design cost would be significantly higher than its current value.  In spite these CAD innovations, the demand for design complexity continues to outpace the ability of engineers to meaningfully design them.  A continuous pipeline of CAD innovations must continue otherwise design costs will quickly become prohibitive for most semiconductor companies.

One approach to reducing development costs is to add configurability to the embedded processors, memory, and communications that make up a System-on-Chip (SoC).  Configurability provides SoCs with performance, energy-efficiency, and area-efficiency characteristics closer to that of expensive custom circuitry.  At the same time, the flexibility of processor-based architectures is maintained resulting in better reuse, reduced risk, and faster time-to-market.

This research will investigate methods for augmenting Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chip (MPSoCs) with processor and memory configurability.  The current trend towards multiprocessor SoCs has many advantages in terms of energy-efficiency and performance; however, the design tools necessary for MPSoC design are far from mature.  Adding configurability to MPSoCs greatly improves performance while minimizing cost; however, it adds many additional challenges to design-tool methodologies.  This research will tackle these challenges thus improving the CAD tools available to designers.  This will make MPSoCs more accessible to the average semiconductor company.  The implications of this work to the average consumer are faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient products.

"My research focuses on studying  fundamental physics of cosmology via measurements of structure on very large scales.   I am the only non-US member of the small team which built the WMAP satellite, the first experiment to produce a map of the whole microwave sky with angular resolution below one degree.  These measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have provided convincing evidence of the constituents of the universe including a constraint that w, the ratio of pressure to energy density during inflation, is near to -1, and, in our most recent data, a detection of a cosmic neutrino background. 

     WMAP operation is approved through eight years of data collection.  My laboratory is also involved in several other CMB experiments which will complement the WMAP measurements.  ACT is a 6 metre telescope we helped to build which measures at smaller angular scales.  Comparison of ACT data to WMAP will reveal the slope of the primodrial power spectrum.    We are also partners with Cal Tech and Toronto in a series of CMB polarization experiments.  Taken together, knowledge of polarization and the spectral index will allow us to choose between models of inflation, which we believe took place in the first very tiny fraction of a second.   These experiments will provide important new results during the period of this grant. 

     I am the PI of a proposal to the CFI to build an innovative new telescope at the DRAO to examine baryon acoustic oscillations by mapping neutral hydrogen in the redshift range 0.8 to 2.5.      These are the same oscillations we study with measurements of the CMB, but viewed at a much later epoch.  Their evolution will significantly constrain models of Dark Energy.

     We have helped to build and are leading the scientific use of two instruments which will revolutionize our understanding of the star formation history of the universe, BLAST, a balloon-borne telescope, and SCUBA2, a large-format camera for the JCMT.

"Sheet metal forming has existed for many years as a manufacturing technique; forming refers to the deformation process through which a material is shaped by the addition of stresses causing the material to flow plastically. Incremental forming (IF) is a more modern process where small deformations are made in the material, a specific sequence of small deformations result in the desired shape. Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF) is a highly flexible and cost effective new sheet metal forming process for limited quantity manufacturing. SPIF has the potential to have a significant impact on rapid prototyping, low quantity production and customized production. The process is extremely adaptable due to the lack of need for part specific forming dies and the use of equipment that is commonly found in machine shops. Forming is achieved by incrementally deforming material with the use of a generic fixture and forming tools.



The advancements in SPIF have occurred as required. As the need arose for specific parts, a trial-and-error experimental studies were completed to determine how to produce the part. To make SPIF a practical manufacturing process in sheet metal forming, more fundamental research is needed to understand the process; thus eliminating the need for trial-and-error studies of individual parts. To advance the knowledge base of SPIF the undertaking of more methodical studies to determine effects the many process variables have on SPIF.



The present research program will include fundamental experimetnal studies to determine critical factors; such as material type, material thickness, machine feedrate, tool size, lubrication type, etc. The proposed research builds on a previous parametric study, where only a small number of the variables were investigated. By undertaking this research greater knowledge of incremental forming is achieved, this will improve the opportunites for applications.

"Oxidative stress has been associated with chronic diseases (diabetes, heart disease, Lou Gehrig's, obesity) and aging. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important signaling molecules that mediate proper cellular functions, and have been implicated in the adaptive cellular response to changes in environmental conditions. However, elevated levels of ROS become harmful to essential biological processes and result in cellular dysfunction and death. My research program aims to investigate the effects of exercise and antioxidant compounds on the levels of ROS, and hence oxidative stress, by using the G93A mouse, an animal model of heightened oxidative stress. The transgenic G93A mouse has a mutant antioxidant enzyme (Cu/Zn-SOD) that increases the production of ROS. This animal model shows an increase in markers of oxidative stress and a compensatory upregulation of antioxidant enzyme activity, however this adaptation is incomplete. Its life span is seven times shorter than its wildtype counterpart. In a series of studies, I will investigate the impact of different exercise modes and antioxidant supplementation by subjecting G93A mice and their wildtype counterparts (control group) to conditions of -1- increased oxidative stress, -2- adaptive compensatory mechanisms, and -3- decreased oxidative stress. Analyses will be conducted to measure markers of inflammation and oxidative damage in lipids, protein and DNA, protein content of enzymes involved in oxidative stress management and signaling, mitochondrial efficiency, cell stress and cell death in skeletal muscle, heart, liver and central nervous system. This animal model allows for the evaluation of different experimental strategies to understand the biochemical and molecular processes associated with the harmful effects of increased levels oxidative stress. This research will improve our understanding of the link between oxidative stress and chronic diseases.

"Genetic diversity and geographic patterns of genetic variation in tree species today are to a large extent the result of their recent evolutionary history. Above all, recurring ice ages and warm-periods have had profound effects on the geographical distributions and patterns of genetic diversity in tree species in Canada. Knowledge of these dynamic histories and the resulting patterns of genetic variation helps us to manage genetic resources of tree species in tree improvement programs and to conserve genetic diversity and evolutionary potential in natural tree populations. Further, understanding how species have responded to climate change in the past through migration, adaptation, range expansion, and/or extirpation of populations will help us to predict their vulnerability to anthropogenic climate change in the future.  



Traditionally, the fields of paleoecology and pyhlogeography have reconstructed biogeographic histories of species using pollen sediments and fossil records or by analyzing today's tree populations with genetic marker techniques for signatures of past events that persist to the present. I propose a new approach, ecological niche modeling, to complement sparse information from pollen, fossil, and genetic data. Ecological niche modeling uses interpolated climate data and other site factors such as soils and topography as independent predictor variables and biological inventory data as dependent variables to generate a predictive model for species habitat or frequency. While ecological niche modeling has been widely used to assess potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change in the future, the approach has never been used to simulate species distributions in the past.

"I propose to develop highly-automated, robust and accurate computational techniques for medical image analysis (MIA). Novel image processing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and artificial life techniques will be investigated and validated in a medical context. 

          Medical imaging provides challenging algorithmic problems and has a potential for improving health. The challenges are primarily due to the large anatomical shape variability (e.g. humeral bicipital groove), non-rigid anatomy (e.g. myocardium), noisy medical images (e.g. MRI, CT, or SPECT), data variety (e.g. 2D colour microscopy, 3D MRI, time-varying PET, or diffusion tensor (DT) MRI), and higher demand for robustness and accuracy in medicine compared to other areas.

          Optimization problems are often encountered in MIA. My proposed research involves: 1) investigating the limitations and strengths of existing optimization techniques for understanding the visual data in medical images; 2) formulating MIA problems in new ways amenable to intuitive encoding of heuristics and domain knowledge; and 3) extending optimization techniques to obtain improved convergence and optimality. I will focus on the problems of: (i) medical image segmentation (identifying the boundaries of structures and organs in images, e.g. for subsequent quantification); (ii) medical image registration (spatial alignment of images, e.g. for building variational atlases or fusing multi-modal images); and (iii) structural shape correspondence (pairing homologous points on shapes, e.g. for shape classification and statistical analysis). For segmentation, I will extend scalar image segmentation algorithms to DTMRI data and propose alternative knowledge-driven optimization formulations. For image registration, I will optimize registration strategies rather than using low-level metrics as objective functions. I will also develop alternative optimization approaches for shape correspondence and propose a unified framework for shape correspondence and image registration.

"One of the unifying principles in geometry is that complex systems, such as configurations of planets and stars can often be understood by means of their symmetries. Familiar symmetries include the rotations or reflections of solids in space and the Lorentz transformations of space-time. Discrete invariants and groups of symmetry of continuous motions are studied in algebraic topology, while geometric topology is concerned with the properties of differential manifolds, or higher-dimensional surfaces. Geometry and topology is a flourishing subject for research, with broad connections to other areas of mathematics, science and engineering.



Symmetries of  manifolds are related to algebra and number theory through group theory, and to partial differential equations and analysis through differential forms.  This proposal describes my recent work in three main areas (i) finite group actions on products of spheres, (ii) smooth and continuous group actions on  4-dimensional manifolds and their connections to gauge theory, and  (ii) infinite discrete group actions on high-dimensional manifolds. The new projects include  the development of a new coarse geometry for discrete group actions,  a comparison of finite groups of differentiable transformations with those defined by algebraic equations on algebraic surfaces, and  the study of dynamical and ergodic aspects of infinite groups of transformations on high-dimensional spheres. The goal in each case is to improve our understanding of the many roles of symmetry in mathematical and physical problems.



This research proposal provides many high-level opportunities for training of prospective graduate students and postgraduate researchers, whose future work will make a major contribution to Canada's knowledge-based economy.

"Many engineering systems and manufacturing processes require accurate temperature control during operation, examples of which are nuclear safety systems, i.e., emergency core cooling systems in nuclear reactors, electronic packaging cooling systems, and various applications in material processing such as: hot rolling of steel strips, continuous casting, hardening of steel bars, and extrusions and forgings. In many of these applications cooling using liquid jet impingement (LJI) is employed. As liquid jets impinge on the hot surface, heat transfers to the cooling liquid. Thereby, liquid temperature increases up to the boiling point at which time liquid starts to boil. Findings of recent research by the applicant and others demonstrated that the boiling phenomena associated with LJI cooling are very complicated, depend on the interaction of many variables, and have not been completely understood yet. This research has also indicated that the use of LJI cooling has many advantages over other cooling techniques. Those advantages are:  (1) its significant flexibility in achieving desired cooling rates, (2) The possibility of using plain water, replacing other cooling liquids, such as, oils and polymer solutions, which are (i) more expensive, (ii) not widely available as water, and (iii) have significantly higher impact on the environment. Because of our lack of full understanding of the complicated boiling phenomena associated with LJI cooling and the significant advantages it can offer, the proposed research has two main streams. The first stream focuses on discovering and understanding the effect of many parameters that have not been fully investigated yet, such as, surface curvature, surface roughness, and interaction of multiple jets on the physics of the complicated boiling phenomena associated with LJI cooling. The goal of this stream is to advance our state of knowledge of LJI cooling. The second stream is concerned with the development of mechanistic models. The main objective of this stream is to present knowledge produced by the first stream in the most useful form for our Canadian industry to develop design guidelines and to achieve optimum operating conditions.

"PEMFCs rely on carbon-supported catalysts to multiply the active catalytic surface area in the catalyst layers (CLs). The durability of such CLs is a crucial issue in PEMFCs development and commercialization. Despite its widespread use, the carbon black (CB) support undergoes electrochemical oxidation to surface oxides (also catalyzed by Pt) and eventually to CO2 at the cathode. As the support gets corroded away, Pt nanoparticules are lost from the electrode or aggregated to larger particles. One strategy is to use a carbon material with a higher graphitic content, such as the carbon nanostructures (CNS) that we have developed and studied for the past few years. Our results have shown that under accelerated corrosion conditions, for the same period of time by which Pt/CB lost 100% of its performance, Pt/CNS had only lost 23%. Our research proposal is in continuity with what we have accomplished so far and has three objectives: (1) A series of binary PtM alloys (M = Co, Cr, Mn, Mo) supported on CB have shown some enhancement in the kinetics of ORR by a factor of 3 to 5. Also, taking into account the cost consideration of Pt, we intend to study the performance and stability of PtM/CNS. The activity of the Pt alloy catalyzing the corrosion of carbon support compared with the activity of Pt metal, the rate of dissolution and agglomeration of PtM over long runs, the microstructure of Pt-bimetallic nanoparticules and ORR enhancement are some of the key areas that will be covered. (2) Another important aspect of our CNS is their enhanced micro porosity and higher pore volume. Other studies reported that carbon support with smaller pore sizes preferentially retains water in the gas phase and alleviates flooding within the cathode CL. A more detailed investigation of our CNS properties is necessary in order to induce favorable modifications in their pore geometry while retaining all the essential characteristics as a durable support. (3) Simulations with ordered CLs have shown that if the CL had a well defined structure alignment normal to the membrane, higher power densities could be achieved. Thus, our last objective is to impose a preferred orientation of the Pt/CNS by application of a magnetic field while in ink form.","Materials performance","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng."

"Rusts are among the most important pathogens of plants and occur worldwide on almost all plant groups. Pine trees are very susceptible to rust diseases which cause stem and branch cankers and tree mortality. White pine blister rust, caused by the fungal pathogen Cronartium ribicola, was introduced to North America over 100 years ago. The disease is so devastating that it has rendered soft pines unattractive for reforestation because mortality can reach 100% in plantations. Recently, the pathogen has moved to new geographic areas and to new hosts, including high elevation pines which appear to be extremely sensitive to the disease. The disappearance of these keystone species is dramatic and is impacting entire alpine ecosystems. Yet, much is unknown of the pine rust epidemiology and capacity for adaptation. Questions are still unanswered regarding source of inoculum, means of spread, the role of various spore types, and host specificity. I propose to address the following questions to better understand the epidemiology and adaptation of white pine blister rust. 1) I propose to investigate the molecular epidemiology of white pine blister rust on different hosts across a diverse landscape. In particular, I will test whether or not altitudinal and latitudinal gradients and host specialization are observed in the fungal population. 2) I want to determine the epidemiological contribution of interspecific C. ribicola x C. comandra (= C. x flexilis) rust hybrids. Although we demonstrated that these two rusts can hybridize, we still don't know what, if any, is the contribution of the hybrids to the rust epidemics. 3) I propose to scan the Cronartium ribicola genome for the signature of specific adaptation by using a population genomics approach. To test this, I plan to perform a broad genome scan on rust populations from different hosts to search for genes that are under selection with regards to host. This research will generate new data that will contribute to our understanding of the epidemiology and adaptation of this important tree pathogen. Answers to these questions will allow better monitoring and management of this important disease.

"This research project aims at developing a mathematical simulation method for predicting long chain branching structure and frequency in polymer molecules.  Polymeric materials are typically made in stirred tank reactor vessels and then processed into final products by melting and shaping. Examples of these products include pipes, bottles, computer cases, films and adhesives. The processing properties of the polymeric materials depend on the rheology of the polymers which, in turn, depends on the molecular properties of the polymer chains (e.g. composition, molecular weight distribution, long chain branching type, frequency and length).  These molecular properties are determined by conditions in the initial reaction vessel.  



Obtaining desired rheological properties requires much expensive trial and error experimentation. To reduce this we must develop relationships between polymer molecular properties and rheological properties.  The proposed research focuses on developing such relationships and is based on, and extends, previous work that developed mathematical simulation methods based on the method of Physical Pulses.  This produced a mathematical model that was applied to a commercial polymerization process used by the rubber industry, successfully predicting the full molecular weight distributions for polymer chains produced in an anionic polymerization.



The current proposed work comprises developing a simulation method capable of predicting long chain branching frequency and structure as affected by mixing (including diffusion effects) at the molecular level.  This will be the Method of Physical Pulses Incorporating the Effects of Polymer Chain Diffusion Rates.  In order to satisfy the goal of developing a method that gives accurate, quantitative predictions we will synthesize and analyze many polyolefins with varying long chain branching structure and frequency.

"In organs and tissues of the human body, cells adhere to a complex scaffold-like protein mesh called the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM provides cells with many stimuli and signals that cells need to behave normally. However, sometimes cells are forced to come into contact with artificial materials. Central in many bioengineering applications is the attachment of human cells to artificial materials, but the factors important in successful cell-material attachment are not well understood. Our previous research has identified that the topography and chemistry of materials can be altered to enhance cell attachment. When a cell attaches to a surface, it results in activation of important signaling molecules required by the cells to survive. Cells attach to surfaces through specialized sites called focal adhesions (FA), and research is highlighting that these adhesions are very important sites in cells. FAs are responsible for relaying the attachment event to other areas within the cells that control normal cell behaviour. We hypothesize that by altering the chemistry and topography of the materials, we can enhance the function of human fibroblasts. Using techniques harnessed from the microelectronic industry, it has become possible to produce structures with precisely defined surfaces for cell-biological studies, thus allowing the reaction of cells to defined topographic and chemical features to be observed. The aim of our research is 1) to investigate the interactions of human fibroblasts with nano- and micro-metric repeating groove topographies, 2) to quantify matrix assembly and tissue development by fibroblasts on nano- and micro-metric repeating groove topographies. The results of the study will directly address how cells transmit external stimuli into signals that regulate their normal behaviour, which will be important for all areas of cell biology. We anticipate that the information produced by our program could in the long term be used in cell and tissue engineering applications, where our lack of understanding of cell-material interactions are limiting the development of engineered tissue substitutes.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Cell Biology"
"In my research, I will look for new ways of discovering knowledge using computers.

     First and foremost, I will create new ways for computer programs to identify the most interesting conclusions that can be drawn from vast collections of data called databases.  A variety of methods have been developed to automatically analyze databases.  These methods are typically based on mathematical formulas called measures of interest.  Unfortunately, these methods find too many relationships among the data for people to understand easily.  Researchers have devised ways by which software can select some of the information, but these ways need to be modified to produce fewer conclusions.  As well, they need to be adapted for use in specific fields, tasks, and people.  One attractive way of proceeding is to take a group of existing and new measures and analyze their relationships mathematically and experimentally.

     Secondly, and more specifically, I would like to find ways of keeping computers from reporting obvious information about time and space as newly discovered relationships. People understand relationships involving time and space very well. So, the computer should only report relationships about time and space that are not known to people. My approach will be based on keeping track of what people already know and what they might expect to be true, given knowledge already reported. Then, a new discovery made by software acting on a database will only be reported if it is something that a person might not expect from what was already reported.

     Thirdly, I will try to make it easier to create animations. Now, it takes hours of painstaking effort to create short animations using software. I will change the software to allow background characters to be animated more easily.  Individual non-player characters in current computer games and crowds of background characters in current movies are animated by creating a software agent for every character and having the agent play the animation most suited to the character's current situation.  I will extend this idea by allowing the agent to create plans involving many steps and then execute these plans while playing suitable animations.

"In computational chemistry, my research focus is on the chemical and physical properties of metallic nanostructures, clusters, complexes and compounds.  In particular, I am interested in gold and silver nanorods and clusters that have unusual geometries or stabilities.  These species may be bare metal atoms or, because the metal-sulphur bond is strong, they may be protected by sulphur-containing molecules. Some of these species have special optoelectronic properties and could be used as components of nanostructured devices.  I also do calculations on complexes of mercury and arsenic which, due to their toxicity, are of interest in environmental chemistry.  The mercury species are modeled under conditions approximating flue gases in coal-fired power plants while the arsenic species are modeled under conditions approximating aqueous solution. I plan to do calculations for hydrogen-bonded complexes of arsenic species with water molecules.  I also plan to do calculations on hydrogen-bonded or proton-transfer complexes of interest in atmospheric chemistry.



In theoretical chemistry, my research focus is on the quantum-classical correspondence- the area in which quantum and classical mechanics connect. My work contributes to the development of a mathematical framework in which the electron density is the fundamental variable.  The electron density determines all properties of molecules and these can be calculated within the framework of density functional theory.  In my formulation, components of the kinetic energy are found to be directly proportional to either the Fisher information (a measure of localization) or the Shannon entropy (a measure of delocalization).  My work could therefore strengthen the connection between quantum mechanics and information theory.  My work could also aid in the construction of an accurate kinetic-energy functional which depends only on the electron density. This would mean that computations could be done more efficiently for large systems.  I also plan to develop the one-electron potential (a functional of the electron density) as a tool for predicting reactivity.

"The objective of my research is to better understand the timing and process of the growth of the continents, particularly during a younger part of the Precambrian era (2500-1000 million years ago). This work is achieved through a combination of geological mapping, for example in well exposed coastal areas of northern Labrador and south Greenland, followed by geochemical and microscope analysis of the rocks, careful separation of minerals and a determination of their crystallization ages.



In order to determine the absolute ages and understand the sequence of igneous rocks that helped form the continents, the radiometric clock of uranium (U) decay to daughter lead (Pb) is used.  These elements are present in certain tiny, rare minerals (such as zircon and baddeleyite) in selected rocks. Measurement of the U/Pb ratio in these minerals is carried out in the Jack Satterly Geochronology Laboratory at the University of Toronto, the birthplace of modern U/Pb dating methods and one of the few labs in the world with extremely low background levels of environmental Pb contamination. 



The ages so determined tell us the amount of time elapsed since these rocks cooled and crystallized from a molten lava (magma). The results of precise age dating possible in this lab (with errors on the order of � 1 million years or less) enable us to discriminate between competing geological hypotheses and to resolve whether closely-timed, incremental, continental growth events are related.

"Construction and infrastructure management requires collecting and integrating huge amount of information about all the lifecycle phases including design, construction, operation, inspection and maintenance. The ability to collect and access this information in real time would provide great support to construction and facilities managers. Furthermore, this information is also very useful to emergency responders in case of extreme events, such as fires, especially when coupled with location information. Advancements in wireless sensors and tracking and identification systems using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) positioning technologies provide new opportunities to drastically improve the performance of integrated construction and infrastructure management systems. For example, UWB systems can be used to enhance safety in construction projects involving heavy equipments by detecting possible collisions. RFID systems can provide the ID and help in tracking the location of infrastructure components. The main objective of the proposed research program is to investigate how these technologies can better serve the purpose of construction and infrastructure management systems. More specifically the objectives are: (1) Investigating collaborative multi-agent systems for supporting construction equipment operators using real-time field data capturing; (2) Investigating methods for lifecycle management of facilities components using RFID technology and Building Information Model; and (3) Investigating indoor navigation methods for emergency response. Both laboratory and field testing will be used to study the characteristics of different types of sensors and tracking and identification systems under different conditions. This will be followed by defining a set of requirements and specifications of how these technologies can be used individually or in combination. Process re-engineering techniques will be used to study the methods of using these technologies in the processes of heavy equipment construction, infrastructure lifecycle management, and emergency response. Furthermore, cost-benefit analysis will be used to study the cost-effectiveness of their deployment in real projects.

"As in other vertebrates, a sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in fish blood transports and regulates the access androgens and estrogens to tissues. Recently we were the first to clone and produce fish SHBGs using recombinant DNA techniques, and this allowed us to analyze their biochemical characteristics, and to investigate how fish shbg genes are regulated at critical stages of the life cycle, including periods of reproductive maturation and spawning. These studies have shown that the steroid-binding properties of SHBG vary substantially among fish species, and that fish SHBGs bind and sequester man-made ""xenobiotics"" known to disrupt their ability to reproduce. They also demonstrate that salmon are unusual among fish species in that they express more than one shbg gene which produce two poorly conserved forms of SHBG (SHBG-alpha and SHBG-�) with unique steroid-binding properties. It is likely that these ancestrally-replicated salmon shbg genes are regulated by unique DNA sequences and tissue-specific nuclear proteins. As outlined in this proposal, our short-term objectives are to: (a) Produce recombinant salmon SHBG-alpha and SHBG-� for the generation of specific reagents, to compare their biochemical properties, and to screen for xenobiotics that bind salmon SHBGs; (b) Define the tissue-specific control of both salmon shbg genes during the life-cycle, especially in the contexts of sexual maturation, development, and nutritional status. Longer-term objectives are to examine how the two salmon SHBGs influence sex steroid access to their target tissues in relation to reproduction and other life cycle changes, including for instance their effects on muscle. The novelty and significance of this research is that SHBGs with unique biochemical properties in salmon represents an unrecognized complexity in terms of steroid action in these fish: a greater understanding of which will provide insight into their reproductive strategies that are of environmental and commercial importance to Canada.

"Cells contain proteins in their membranes that enable the transfer of important nutrients into the cell, as well as the removal of unwanted substances from the cells.  We are studying one particular type of these ""transport"" proteins that is involved in the cellular uptake and release of nucleosides.  Nucleosides are a class of substances that are used as the building blocks for DNA and RNA, and are also important for controlling many other aspects of cell function.   Cells require different levels of nucleosides at different times, and must adapt to their environment to ensure that the nucleoside concentrations, both inside and outside the cell, are maintained at specific levels.  We are studying this cellular adaptation process.  Our studies are focussed on how cells regulate the number and activity of ""nucleoside transporters"".   An increase or decrease in nucleoside transporter activity has been known to modify blood flow to tissues, protect the heart and brain tissue from damage during transient ischemic episodes, and modify the duration of seizures.  A better understanding of how the body regulates these transporters will enhance our ability to develop better therapies for conditions such as heart failure, seizures, and stroke.  These studies will also enhance our understanding of how the cell regulates its metabolism in response to environmental influences.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Cell Biology"

"The applicant's research program aims at the development of effective treatment approaches dedicated to the agricultural and agri-food effluents via chemical transformation, adsorption and upgrading. Within this framework, the applicant's second discovery grant focuses on the development of an adsorption technology for the abatement of phosphates, nitrate and ammonium nitrogen, three key pollutants occurring in agricultural liquid effluents. In this regard, nitrogen and phosphorus are particularly important pollutants as both are implicated in aquatic eutrophication. Furthermore, the presence of nitrite and nitrate ions in drinking water is a potential public health hazard, while the presence of ammonium nitrogen in natural waters will result in acute toxicity to fish and other forms of aquatic life even at concentrations as low as 0.2 mg/L. The applicant intends to pursue the development of a technological approach allowing for a combined removal and recovery of nitrate and phosphates from agricultural liquid effluents and to extend this approach to ammonium cations as well.  

The specific objectives are (1) to synthesize and optimize the adsorbents formulations; (2) to study the adsorption process using model pollutants in aqueous solutions and (3) to apply the promising adsorbent formulations for the treatment of real effluents stemming from swine farms and fish farms. 

This program has a potential to develop new knowledge on the environmental control of agricultural liquid pollution via adsorption. The benefits that could accrue from this research include sustainable solution for the acute negative repercussions of agricultural activities on the environment.

To advance this objective, this research aims at developing analog and mixed-signal (hybrid analog/digital) circuits, which are highly integrated in nanometer CMOS technologies and which are optimized for processing information at high speeds. LONG TERM, the research thrusts are:

   1) to devise novel circuit-design techniques for low-power high-resolution analog circuits, which are fabricated in nanometer CMOS technologies for higher integration of the analog and digital domains in a digital communication system and, hence, lower fabrication costs: system-on-chip (SoC) concept.

   2) to develop innovative mixed-signal architectures for key communication-system blocks. Our vision is to utilize the advanced digital-signal-processing (DSP) capabilities of nanometer CMOS technologies, in order to mitigate the nonideal behavior of the analog circuitry in a digital-communication system.

   3) to demonstrate the practicality of the developed architectures and circuits through the design, implementation, and testing of integrated prototypes.

NEAR TERM, the research emphasis is to achieve a breakthrough in the limitations (integration, speed, and power) that analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) impose on broadband wireless communication systems. A particular challenge is to move these data converters closer to the high-frequency front-end of the communication system, with the goal of integrating its RF, analog, and digital portions on a single chip. Another goal is to enable the digital programmability of the wireless system to multiple communication standards: software-defined-radio concept.

"The objective of the proposed research is the exploration of new approaches to aid developers in comprehending the behaviour of a software system through the exploration of execution traces. Traces have historically been difficult to work with since they can be extremely large. Therefore, we need to investigate ways to allow software engineers to understand and analyse their content. In this proposal, we intend to investigate the following techniques:



Firstly, we will study how various portions of a trace can be treated as the same pattern. The objective is to develop advanced trace simplification algorithms. 



Secondly, we will study how high-level behavioural design models can be automatically extracted from large traces. These models will record the essence of traces making it easier for an engineer to comprehend the information. 



Thirdly, we will develop an exchange format for representing traces in a standardised way. This work will be based on an existing format called the Trace Compact Format (CTF). We will investigate how to best extend the power of expression of CTF in order to support various types of traces generated from mutli-threaded systems.



Finally, we will study how to best represent traces in a visualization environment. The resulting trace analysis tool will incorporate the outcome of the above-mentioned studies.

"With the advance of technology, nowadays we are living in a world which is full of digital data sets such as digital images and videos. In order to process, store, and transmit data efficiently, a mathematical model with desirable properties is in high demand to sparsely and economically represent various types of data sets. In fact, modern information technology is built on many advanced mathematical tools coupled with fast computational algorithms. As a multiscale-based representation simulating the procedure that our human eyes use to analyze images, a wavelet or framelet has proved to be an effective computational tool for sparsely representing a wide range of digital data sets. For example, wavelet-based methods are now standard tools for image compression and signal denoising.



On the other hand, many types of data sets in various applications are multi-dimensional and can be often effectively modeled by various classical function spaces. It is of great importance in both theory and application to study multivariate symmetric wavelets and framelets in various function spaces so that new symmetric multivariate framelets can be constructed and the applicability of wavelets and framelets can be largely extended to new application areas that are not possible for traditional wavelets and framelets in the classical square integrable function space.



The proposed research, if being successfully carried out, will have significant contributions to pure mathematics by advancing the fundamental theory of wavelets and framelets, to applied mathematics by discovering new symmetric wavelet frames that are of interest in a broad range of applications, and to information technology by discovering new computational algorithms. This proposed research will undoubtedly in various ways and senses benefit our Canadian society.

"Canadian citizens are proud to have a standard of living that has routinely been selected as among the best in the world.  The wealth of resources found in Canada has contributed greatly to our quality of life. However, as the world's population grows towards 10 billion by 2050, and the Earth's non-renewable fuel sources are gradually depleted, the demand for energy will exceed currently projected reserves. Although Canadian energy reserves may satiate our own demands for energy in the foreseeable future, they may also slow our response to the impending world energy crisis, and more significantly, impede our commitment to alternative energy research out of complacency. This would be a grave error as Canadians would be at a scientific and technological disadvantage compared to less energy independent nations for generations to come. Thus, alternative energy research and the concomitant training of graduate students and researchers in this area so critical to Canada's future prosperity is of fundamental importance.

For example, much hype surrounds the so-called hydrogen economy, yet very little thought has gone into developing a renewable source of hydrogen. In particular, the current production method for H2 makes use of fossil fuels and releases CO2 into the atmosphere in the process and is, therefore, not carbon neutral. The typical methods of H2 production are steam reforming, partial hydrocarbon oxidation, and coal gasification, all of which produce CO2.  Therefore, the push for a H2 economy has stimulated research in fuel cells, H2 storage and delivery, and H2 distribution systems, yet very little research has gone into the clean and sustainable production of H2.

    )	We have developed photo-catalytic metal complexes capable of producing H2 from H2O and CO from CO2, which when combined form syngas, an important industrial carbon source. We urgently require a gas chromatograph in order to optimize the photoproduction of these important gases. This research will make H2 and CO production a renewable resource based on solar energy.

"The objective of my research program over the next five years (and leading to the longer term ten-year time frame) is to gain a better understanding of the Earth's crustal processes recorded through chemical and isotopic variations in accessory minerals such as zircon, monazite, apatite, and titanite.  To work towards that goal, I will utilize results obtained by doing in situ tracer radiogenic isotope measurements, including Lu-Hf in zircon and Sm-Nd in monazite, apatite, and titanite; the trace element compositions of those minerals; and U-Th-Pb geochronology.  This comprehensive suite of complimentary geo-analytical techniques will be effectively and efficiently used to address a wide range of diverse geologic problems that collectively were not possible until recently.

As part of the Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd research, synthetic minerals will be grown at high-T, doped with elements and specific isotopes of elements, and then chemically and structurally characterized.  These crystals will be used as isotopic standards for Hf in zircon and Nd in monazite, titanite, and apatite for radiogenic tracer isotope studies.  The synthetic standards will then be used to obtain more precise and accurate in situ analyses of natural minerals using laser ablation multi collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  One area to be investigated over the next five years includes the granite-lower crustal xenolith connection using Mesozoic lower crustal xenoliths and granites from the Mojave Desert in SE California.  This locality is ideal for studying the granite-source connection, as the source region and possibly related anatectic melts can be directly sampled.  The source region of post-Alpine tonalites and related rocks from the Adamello batholith in northern Italy will also be studied as part of a larger collaborative research effort with colleagues in Switzerland.  The third focus area will address the origin of iron ore, copper, gold (IOCG) and iron ore apatite (IOA) ore deposits and related rocks from the Norrbotten region (e.g.,  Kiruna) in northern Sweden.

"My proposal concerns three interconnected topics: 1) matrix-valued random

walks, ergodic transformation, & W*-factors, 2) positive polynomials,

power series, & polyhedra, and 3) asymptotics of coefficients of power

series. 



Impact of my work:

(1) While the general classification theorems for factors relating to

random walks have been around for decades, there are very few results or

techniques for deciding isomorphism or non-isomorphism of specific

examples. Results in this direction will be very significant,

particularly in understanding the random walks via the dimension group

approach. 



(2) Connections between problems in positivity and in real algebraic

geometry are only in their nascent stage. However, my approach seems to be very promising. 



(3) The results in the asymptotics section speak for themselves.



Each of these topics will have plenty of questions that will be suitable

as Ph.D. projects, and some as master's level projects. In working in

any of the parts of the proposal, students will be exposed to a wide

spectrum of mathematics, much more than the usual narrow focus seen in

doctoral theses.

"Visual attention and its role in visuomotor processing



Humans are remarkably adept at grasping objects that remain outside the central focus of gaze.  Hands are shaken while maintaining eye contact, coffee cups are grabbed while reading the newspaper, and doors are opened without looking down at the knobs or handles.  In normal humans, these kinds of actions are performed effortlessly and typically without thought.  Yet underlying this ability is the brain, which automatically takes in visual information and then somehow manages to convey this information to the motor system so that we can accurately guide our hand to the appropriate objects.  The goal of my research is to understand how the brain actually accomplishes this most basic of tasks.  For example, when we reach out to grasp a doorknob, how is it that the motor system ""knows"" to plan for grasping the knob and not some other nearby object within our field of view?  In this regard, the theme of my work has centered on the extent to which visual attention--that is, what we pay attention to or ""select"" in our visual world--is used to help visually guide our hand actions.  Towards addressing these issues, my proposal here draws on three related lines of research.  The first concerns understanding how these ""visual-motor"" interactions change when we start to mind wander.  Is it the case that the visual system can still accurately tell the motor system what to do with our hands even when we're lost in our own thoughts?  The second line of research seeks to determine whether visual attention helps not just hand actions, but actions associated with the feet (e.g., walking) as well.  That is, do we use our visual attention to help guide where we should place our feet?  The third and final line of research explores how learning may be critical for normal visual attention-motor interactions.  Collectively the work is all premised on functional neuroimaging methods, and promises to provide new insights into how the brain uses visual information to plan motor movements.

"Much of our current understanding of the nature and origin of galaxies depends on our careful analyses of the rich, supremely beautiful globular star clusters. The globular clusters contain the oldest known stars, and many of them date from the time of the formation of the galaxies themselves.  They are thus ideal 'fossil tracers' of a galaxy's  history.  A typical cluster contains hundreds of thousands of sun-like stars held in a mutual gravitational embrace, like a swarm of luminous bees.  Individual globular clusters are consequently ultra-luminous, and can be studied in remote galaxies.  (Indeed, many of the target galaxies are at distances of tens of millions of light years.)  



Globular clusters orbit their parent galaxies on timescales of tens or hundreds of millions of years, and their orbital properties and chemical compositions can be studied spectroscopically, using the largest reflecting telescopes on the ground or in Earth orbit. In the early universe, the primordial gas out of which the stars would later form consisted almost entirely of the lightest elements: hydrogen and helium. We investigate the spectroscopic evidence for how much the stars within the globular clusters have changed in composition since the early stages of the universe, and seek to understand how that is related to their dynamical states of motions around the parent galaxies.    



In recent years, discoveries of relatively young globular clusters have led to a fresh understanding of how interactions and mergers between entire galaxies can play an important role in galaxy birth and evolution.  The fate of our own Milky Way galaxy, for example, seems inevitably to include a merger with the nearby Andromeda spiral galaxy -- an event a billion years in the future which may be heralded by the spawning of large numbers of rich star clusters.

"Canada is faced with a critical shortage of platinum and palladium for the future demand of innovative energy production and fuel storage technologies. These metals are uniquely suited to these technological applications, and have no alternatives. Faced with shrinking reserves of platinum and palladium from traditional geological settings (""mafic"" igneous rocks) in Canada, and the high cost of obtaining these metals from foreign suppliers, the mineral exploration industry will need to focus on geological environments in Canada that were previously not considered as being viable sources for the metals, but which are known to contain them in significant quantities in certain areas. Porphyry-type deposits are metallic ore deposits that typically contain a variety of valuable metals in a number of distinct zones. The deposits form as ""felsic"" magmas (i.e, molten rocks rich in Si, Al, Na and K) rise into the crust, cool and crystallize, and release fluid phases that can no longer stay dissolved in the magma. These fluids may contain high concentrations of dissolved metals that precipitate in economic concentrations. Traditionally considered to be major sources of copper, gold and molybdenum, porphyry deposits may provide extremely important resources of platinum and palladium (the platinum-group elements or ""PGE"") for Canada. Unfortunately, our knowledge of the origin of platinum and palladium in these unusual settings prevents cost-effective and successful discrimination between geological host environments that may or may not contain economic concentrations of platinum and palladium. The proposed research will identify geological criteria that can be directly applied in the mineral exploration industry in Canada to predict the location of new deposits of platinum and palladium in unconventional rock-forming environments such as porphyry deposits already known to contain copper or gold. The proposed research will have direct benefits to Canada`s economy and social/environmental health, and will maintain the country's standing as a world leader in the global geoscience and mineral resource community.

"I propose to develop statistical methods to (1) assess the performance of diagnostic tests and prognostic scores

and (2) estimate risk (cumulative incidence) functions and, from them, individualized 'what if' probabilities of

benefit if a specific medical or lifestyle intervention is selected.

In aim (1) the primary focus will be on the 'c' statistic derived from multiple logistic regression. The initial

biostatistical use of c was as the area under the roc curve (auc), to measure the discriminant ability of imaging

tests (interpreted on a rating scale) and laboratory tests (measured on an interval scale). However, the index is

also standard output from the SAS (multiple) LOGISTIC procedure and is increasingly used to assess the

ability of diagnostic and prognostic scoring systems derived from a vector of predictors. If calculated from the

same data from which the model is fitted, the statistic overestimates the true performance of the system.

Indeed, by construction, the c statistic calculated from PROC LOGISTIC cannot be less than the null 0.5.

Several authors (from Cornfield and Lachenbruch several decades ago, to Copas, Rockette, and Pinsky

recently) have studied the factors that determine the magnitude of this bias. I propose to develop a simple

'adjusted-c' statistic, similar to the adjusted-r-squared statistic. I expect that the needed attenuation/shrinkage

will be a function of the numbers of cases and non-cases, and the numbers of useful -- and useless -- candidate

predictor variables.

A secondary focus will be on simplified lower confidence bound for the true auc when - in the simple imaging

or laboratory test situations -- the observed auc is unity. Obuchowshi has provided limits for this situation, but

unfortunately they are too distribution-specific to be of general use. My plan is to draw on the simplicity and

closed-form formulae based on overlapping exponential distributions, and on the insights on the var(auc)

structure in our paper in Academic Radiology in 1997.

Aim (2) has two parts. The first is to develop guidelines for a novel way (developed with my colleague

Miettinen) to fit smooth-in-time hazard functions to survival-type data, where the event E=1 represents an

undesirable outcome. The purpose is to estimate cumulative incidence as a function of a vector of patient

characteristics and lifestyle/medical management options. The approach is based on sampling the

person-moments; the main unknown is the choice of the sampling approach that gives the most stable estimate

of the individualized cumulative incidence. The second aim is to derive an interval estimate for the probability

of benefit within a time horizon T, for an individual with a personal profile vector x, and contemplated

medical/behavioral Action (A=1) or not (A=0), i.e. the difference Prob[E=1 | x, T, A=0] - Prob[E=1 | x, T,

A=1]. The hope is to have the individualized interval be test-based, so that it can be calculated from the

information usually contained in study reports.

We focus on individualized risk differences as a response to the inordinate emphasis on the 'average' patient

and on hazard ratios rather than what matters to an individual: for individuals such as I, with profile x, what is

the difference in the probability of E over a time-horizon T if I choose one action over another? As an example,

consider the 2005 NEJM report on an RCT which documented the extent to which radical prostatectomy

reduces the risk of death from prostate cancer: the 'average' prostate cancer case-fatality rate within 10 years

was 15% for those randomized to watchful waiting and 10% for those randomized to surgery; the hazard ratio

was 0.55. The report contained no useful information for men with a patient / tumour profile (age at diagnosis,

Gleason score, pre-treatment PSA level) that was more/less favourable than the 'average' profile to which the

summary results presumably apply. With methods that are aimed at individualized risk, and that do not rely on

the non-smooth estimates obtained from Cox's proportional hazards model, we plan to change the

contemporary culture of statistical reporting to be more responsive to individual 'clients'.

"Collapsible soils are known to experience significant volume decreases due to an increase in moisture content, causing foundation to sink in the ground, which further damages the building and reduce its serviceability. Collapsible soils form large parts of Eastern and Western Canada, the United States, Eastern Europe, China, South East Asia, and Northern and Southern Africa. As the human activities continue to increase in these regions, geotechnical engineers must learn how to deal with this difficult soil. Soils susceptible to collapse include: loess, cemented sand and silts, and some residual soils. 

The use of shallow foundations combined with soil replacement constitutes economical designs for light structures on thin collapsible soil layer. However, for heavy structures, pile foundations may be installed to a suitable bearing stratum overlain the collapsible soil layer. In this case, foundation designers should forecast the negative role of the collapsible layer, which may take place during the lifespan of the structure. These piles, however, may not lose only the shaft resistance upon wetting of the surrounding soil, but rather developing negative shaft's friction, which in turn will reduce significantly the pile capacity. 

This project is an integral part of the applicant's on-going research on foundations in/on difficult soils. This proposal is directed to develop a prototype experimental set-up in our Foundation Engineering Laboratory, capable to measure the parameters governing the performance of piles installed in collapsible soils subjected to vertical and lateral loading during soil inundation. 

A three dimensional numerical model will be developed using the Finite Element Technique and the concept of theories for partially saturated soils. After validating the model with the present experimental results and those available in the literature, the model will be used to produce wide range of data to examine the load-transfer mechanism of these piles. The results will be presented in the form of design theory, guidelines for the design and the construction and monitoring these piles during the lifespan.

"This application is for funding to support McGill participation in the VERITAS gamma-ray astronomy project. VERITAS is one of four new-generation gamma-ray astronomy detectors world-wide. It consists of an array of four large telescopes designed to detect ultraviolet and blue light emitted by the energetic electrons and positrons produced when high-energy astrophysical gamma-rays interact in the upper atmosphere. Such gamma-rays are produced in extreme environments such as supernova remnants and active galactic nuclei. There may also be gamma-rays which come from more exotic origins such as annihilation of dark-matter particles in the cores of galaxies or from evaporation of primordial black holes. As such, they could provide clues to particle physics at energies beyond what can be probed at earth-bound accelerators. The VERITAS array is nearing completion in southern Arizona. Two of the four telescopes are taking data together and the third is being commissioned. Telescope four will be complete at the beginning of 2007 and the project will move from the construction phase to the observing and analysis phase. We plan to survey the parts of our galaxy visible from our site and look for new sources with a sensitivity an order of magnitude better than previous generation detectors. We will also carry out multiwavelength observations using data from X-ray, optical and radio telescopes as well as the new, lower energy, gamma-ray satellite, GLAST, due to be launched in the fall of 2007. It is an exciting time for the young science of gamma-ray astrophysics.

"A wide range of economic ore deposit types, including base metals, gold, and uranium, are hosted by or spatially associated with sulphide-bearing, carbonaceous shales or argillites. Carbonaceous shales and argillites are readily identified in airborne electromagnetic surveys and are commonly drilled as potential hosts for volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) and sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) ore deposits. They are also important hosts for orogenic gold, uranium, sediment-hosted copper, and deposits enriched in other metals (e.g., Ni, PGE). In some cases black shales were a reductant trap for metals; in others, they are important lithogeochemical markers of ore-forming events or potential source rocks for metals. However, the role of carbonaceous shales in ore formation remains poorly understood and there are few well-established indicators of ore potential in these rocks in different geological environments. A new international program of research on the lithogeochemistry of shales in relation to different ore deposit types is being initiated with the support of 5 mining companies (Barrick Gold, HudBay Minerals, Newmont, Teck, Ur Energy) as Project 08E04 of the Canadian Mineral Industry Research Organization (CAMIRO). The principal objectives of the project are (i) to improve the current understanding of metal enrichment in shales and argillites in ancient volcanosedimentary basins and in orogenic belts, (ii) to assess the role of carbonaceous sediments as both metal sources and metal traps, during sedimentation and during post-burial metallogenesis (e.g., in orogenic gold deposits), and (iii) to develop new mineralogical, geochemical, and isotopic tools to discriminate between potentially mineralized and unmineralized shales in a variety of ore-forming environments. Five graduate students (3 in Canada, 2 in the U.S. and Australia) will contribute to the project through case studies of base metal deposits, gold deposits, and uranium deposits. Students will gain experience in field work, laboratory analysis, industry interaction, and interpretation and preparation of research publications. Exploration technology developed during the project will be transferred directly to mining companies through the collaborative partnership.","Earth sciences","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"
"The discovery of metal-depositing hot springs at volcanoes on the seafloor, and especially the link to chemosynthetic life, was one of the most compelling scientific advances of the 20th century. 80% of the world's active volcanoes occur in the oceans, and the volcanic and hydrothermal activity is now recognized as having a critical role in the sulfur, carbon and metal cycles of the marine environment. However, important questions remain about the diversity of seafloor hydrothermal systems, the flux of metals from different sources, and the history of metal loading to oceans from hydrothermal vents. Seafloor volcanism was even more prevalent in Earth's ancient oceans, and the associated hydrothermal activity was responsible for many of the world's largest and most valuable mineral deposits.  However, the underlying geodynamic factors controlling the distribution of these resources are not fully understood. To address some of these questions, we are participating in an international effort to explore and document hydrothermal activity in a variety of different volcanic and tectonic settings in the oceans. The specific objectives of the research are: (i) to identify different sources, sinks and transport pathways for metals in modern seafloor hydrothermal systems, (ii) to quantify the natural loading of metals to the oceans from different hydrothermal sources, including those metals with potentially lasting far-field environmental significance, (iii) to compare present-day fluxes of metals with the geological record of past metal accumulations on the seafloor, and (iv) to improve models of the metal inventory of both modern and ancient volcanic terranes. These objectives will be achieved through a program of seafloor mapping and sampling, related laboratory studies, and field work on ancient ore deposits.

"Two-phase microfluidic systems have emerged as promising candidates for high-throughput screening applications in molecular biology and for chemical synthesis. These devices allow for the separation and experimentation with nanoliter volume reactions by compartmentalization within a well-defined water:oil emulsion contained within a microchannel. Such systems allow for the rapid transport of chemical mixtures without axial dispersion and have been demonstrated in the precise measurement of chemical kinetics. In addition, the compartmentalization of reagents at limiting dilution in pL volume chambers allows for an enhancement of concentration and a corresponding increase in assay sensitivity - ultimately allowing for single

cell and single enzyme measurements.

   Despite these advantages, the applicability of two-phase microfluidic systems has been limited due to poor chemical control, irregular droplet formation and a lack of storage elements for long-term incubation. In this proposed research program we will develop and integrate novel two-phase microfluidic systems that combine the flexibility and control of integrated microvalves with the advantages of emulsion-based biochemical reactors.  This work will focus on two avenues of inquiry including 1) the development of fully programmable microfluidic systems with addressable integrated storage and 2) the development of highly parallel microfluidic systems based on self-assembled emulsion arrays.  We will further apply these

systems to the development of improved biomedical research assays including nanoliter volume chemical optimization and precise genotyping by digital polymerase chain reaction amplification in large arrays of water:oil emulsions. These systems will ultimately find broad applicability to areas includng single cell analysis, environmental genotyping and clinical diagnostics. From a technology development perspective the integration of microvalves with two-phase microfluidics is a new frontier for microfluidic research and the devices developed through this work will represent the state of the art in on-chip fluid handing functionality

"The reproductive fitness of many animals relies upon the production of large numbers of gametes over an extended period of time.  The number of gametes produced over the life of the animal often far exceeds the number of cells that exist in the gonad at any given time.  This is possible due to the existence of germline stem cells, which divide to give rise to two types of daughter cells.  One daughter cell becomes the gamete (differentiation), while the other daughter cell retains the same characteristics as the parent (self-renewal), which can then give rise to both types of daughter cells.  Therefore, a population of cells is always maintained from which future gametes can be generated.  A tight balance must be maintained between the number of daughter cells that become gametes and the number of daughter cells that self-renew because a shift towards either fate will eventually result in sterility.  The molecular mechanisms involved in maintaining this balance are not well understood in any system.  We are using the germ line of the model organism, C. elegans, as a model to understand how the balance between stem cell differentiation and self-renewal is maintained.  We have previously found that the proteasome, which degrades proteins in the cell, is needed for this balance to be maintained properly.  We have performed genetic analysis that has helped in our understanding of the possible mechanisms by which the proteasome functions to help control this balance.  We found that at least part of this mechanism is to control the Notch signaling pathway; this signaling pathway is highly utilized in virtually all multicellular animals during development.  We have identified a potentially novel mechanism by which the proteasome controls Notch signaling.  Our current proposal aims to identify the specific proteins that are targeted by the proteasome and understand how their degradation is necessary for the balance between differentiation and self-renewal to be maintained in the C. elegans germ line, which will help in our general understanding of how this balance is maintained in all stem cell systems.  Additionally, it will also help in our understanding of the regulation of the highly conserved Notch signaling pathway.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Cell Biology"

"The proposed research focusses on development of methods (i.e. theorems, exact algorithms and heuristics) and applications of mathematical programming, the aim of which is to solve multivariate, constrained optimization problems. I work in several subfields, with many collaborators.



The first subfield is global optimization whose purpose if to determine global optima of nonlinear, nonconvex functions subject to linear or nonlinear constraints. We will continue our study of problems with particular structure and transformation of problems one into the other, using the concept of embedding of algorithms. This should lead to generalization, simplification and unification of algorithms for several problems as e.g. concave programming, optimization of the efficient set of multicriteria linear programs. etc.



The second subfield is decomposition methods for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems, and their combination with integer programming, interior point methods and global optimization. A third subfields is metaheuristics. We will build upon the success of the recent Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic to obtain near optimal solutions to various problems but also to enhance exact algorithms (e.g. by stabilizing or focusing column generation)

and provide performance guaranties for heuristics. Moreover, we will pursue the development of a new type of application, i.e. finding conjectures in graph theory by computer with the VNS-based AutoGraphiX system. Developed since 1997 it has already led to finding over 1500 conjectures, more than 800 of which have been proved automatically and over 350 by hand in two dozen papers.

"The myelin sheath is a membranous spiral that wraps around the axons (nerves) of the central nervous system (CNS), and enables them to transmit impulses efficiently. Diseases of myelin such as multiple sclerosis and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher affect CNS function and are extremely debilitating. The CNS myelin is formed by extensions of membranes of cells called oligodendrocytes - one oligodendrocyte can enwrap several different nerve fibers. The formation of myelin in early childhood is a complex process that occurs in stages. At each stage, gene expression must be strictly controlled to produce the right amounts of many different components that then need to be delivered to the correct location in the cell. Even in the mature CNS, there is constant turnover and replenishment of myelin proteins and lipids. When one looks at myelin in the electron microscope, one sees mainly compact myelin, but also less compact loop regions. An even closer look indicates that myelin consists of different ""microdomains"" that can be ""dissected"" out by biochemical extractions with detergents. These microdomains differ not so much in composition of their constituent proteins and lipids, but rather in how these proteins have been modified by different enzymes after synthesis (this last process is called ""post-translational modification""). Our research aims to understand how the modification pattern of CNS myelin proteins varies dynamically during development, and spatially in normal adult myelin. We look at the pattern of protein changes as an oligodendrocyte matures, primarily phosphorylation and deimination, because we consider that the balance of these changes is crucial to maintaining a healthy myelin sheath. As part of this endeavour, we look at the structures of one of the modifying enzymes (peptidylarginine deiminase) and of a major constituent protein (proteolipid protein) using a variety of complementary biochemical and biophysical techniques. The peptidylarginine deiminase enzyme represents a possible therapeutic target for multiple sclerosis, and potential inhibitors shall be evaluated functionally and structurally.

Much of what is known about the Rho family and Pak has been come from studying cultured cells and relatively little is known about how these proteins operate in an intact organism. We are using the fruit fly Drosophila to genetically characterize the mechanisms by which Pak regulates epithelial development. Drosophila is a popular research organism due to the advanced techniques that have been developed for studying it, including very sophisticated genetic tools and the ability to do detailed imaging of events at the cellular level within the context of a whole animal. We have been looking at the follicular epithelium in the ovary, a typical epithelium that covers the developing egg. Using this system, we hope to gain insight into how Pak regulates three important processes in epithelial development. The first process is the regulation of cell adhesion, which is critical in determing how cells ""stick"" together to form tissues. The second is the regulation of epithelial cell shape through regulation of a contractile structure called the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Finally, we want to known how Pak regulates the proliferation of epithelial cells. Previous studies in other laboratories have identified various proteins regulating these three processes and we suspect that Pak interacts with these other poteins, perhaps by modifying their activity. We will use both genetics and biochemistry to address the relationship between Pak and these other regulators of epithelial development. This work will be of interest to developmental biologists and cell biologists, furthermore, improper development of epithelia is a cause of diverse birth defects, and our work may yield insight into what cell signaling pathways are defective in such disorders.

"The ~250,000 species of flowering plants exhibit remarkable diversity of reproductive adaptations, with breeding systems ranging from dioecy to hermaphroditism, mating systems ranging from complete self-fertilization to complete cross-fertilization, and a seemingly limitless variety of floral design and display. I expect that much of this diversity represents differences in reproductive function, so that my specific research projects address the roles of design and display in particular pollination and mating environments and their implications for the evolution of plant reproduction.

    My Discovery Grant proposal identifies three sets of projects that address reproductive diversity from a variety of perspectives.  One set of four projects considers various aspect of the role of floral morphology in controlling the precision of pollinator-flower interactions.  This precision influences pollen dispersal between plants and so is a fundamental function of flower structure.  Three additional projects will address the controls on the number of flowers that plants display (the rate of flower opening and flower longevity) and their joint evolution.  A third set of two projects examine the influences of pollination success for the evolution of pollen and ovule production in hermaphroditic species and the evolution of separate sexes.  The final project will expand my research program as I consider the consequences of reproduction for the evolution of vegetative architecture and the form of plants.  

    The research that I propose addresses the reproductive diversity of plants from complementary perspectives, from the function of specific traits to the evolution of sexual systems and plant form. This hypothesis-driven research includes new approaches to old problems and exposes previously unexplored subjects to incisive inquiry. In addition to these fundamental contributions to understanding floral diversity, this research will educate at least seven post-graduate scientists and provide research experience for at least eighteen undergraduate students.

"The inverse relationship between birth weight and post partum health is one of the most fascinating discoveries in mammalian fetal biology. The principal hypothesis governing this relationship is that genetic and/or epigenetic changes underlie alterations in fetal development. Understanding the overall role of transcription factors in mediating these developmental events would provide us with a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling fetal development. In this proposal, we will use a 'candidate transcription factor' approach to first examine the role of one lipid-sensing nuclear receptor family member, the Liver X Receptor (LXR), involved in cholesterol clearance, in an intrauterine model of protein restriction in rats, which leads to lower birthweight, impaired offspring growth, decreased liver to body ratio, and an increase in fetal liver adiposity. With this unique model, we can examine for the first time the developmental changes in the in vivo interaction of transcription factors and epigenetic markers to target promoters, which play an important role in the coordinated control of gene transcription during fetal development.

"My research examines genetic and environmental factors promoting cooperation and sociality in animals, as well as ways in which members of social groups share and process information. Ground squirrels and ants are the focus of my research because they are abundant and highly social. Comparisons of social behaviour across species allow me to identify which factors in general promote animal sociality. My research to date suggests that as societies evolve, they become more inclusive, with increasing cooperation among non-relatives. Favoritism toward kin, and kin recognition common in the early evolution of sociality, may remain in place so that animals can avoid mating with close relatives. My proposed research expands significantly on my earlier findings. First, I will collect field data on whether asocial Franklin's ground squirrels use kin recognition to associate and cooperate preferentially with relatives, or simply to avoid mating with close kin. By looking at the role of kin recognition in asocial species, I can determine what role that ability played in social evolution. I will also conduct experiments on slave making ants, which will test whether long-term parasitic relationships between species can lead to aspects of cooperation. Secondly, as communication among group members is necessary within a society, I will continue research on alarm communication in ground squirrels. I will build on my earlier finding that squirrels recognize individual alarm callers by testing whether call recipients integrate information from multiple unrelated callers to track predator's movements. I will also conduct field studies to test whether individuals share information about their level of vigilance toward possible predators, and whether the ultrasonic alarm calls discovered recently by my lab, selectively warn relatives, or selfishly prevent callers from being located by predators. Examining how information is obtained and processed by animals reveals their underlying cognitive abilities. Overall, my work provides important insights into how sociality evolved, and how communication and cognitive abilities contribute to societal cooperation. The basic biological data obtained on potentially vulnerable Franklin's ground squirrels also contribute to conservation efforts.","Advancement of knowledge","Evolution & Ecology"

"The primary focus of this research will be in the areas of computational number theory and symbolic computation. Many of these problems will have both a  computational and theoretical nature.



One starting point for this research is in the study of Pisot and Salem numbers.  One of the oldest questions in this area is Lehmer's question. This roughly says ""Is there a smallest Salem number, and if so what is it?"".  This question is intimately connected with Mahler measure type questions, and have been a very active area of research.  Another line of research concerns quasicrystals.  Quasicrystals are aperiodic tilings of the plane, or three space, that use Pisot numbers as a key component in their construction. The theory behind their constructions is still not fully understood. Various properties of beta-expansions are also of interest. A beta-expansion is similar to a base 10 expansions, but instead of being based on the digits 0, 1, ..., 9 and powers of 10, beta-expansions use different digit sets, and powers of beta. Beta does not need to be an integer.  It turns out that these beta-expansions have very nice properties if beta is a Pisot numbers or Salem numbers. These properties, although known to be nice, are still not completely understood. 



Other research interests include the integer Chebyshev problem, odd perfect numbers, resultants, and symbolic computation techniques for number theory.  



A significant part of this proposal is for the training of highly qualified personal.  I have had good success with training students, at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral level.  I have numerous ideas for projects that are just waiting for the right student.

"To meet the changing demand for healthcare, governments (both in Canada and abroad) must continually balance budgets against future predictions of healthcare service demand.  This has produced a growing need to better understand the individuals who access the healthcare system and how to optimally interact with them. To help meet this need, the proposed research will focus on improving mathematical modelling and optimization techniques, and applying these in the setting of healthcare.



Recently, we have seen growth in the applications of mathematical modelling to healthcare.  Much of the success of new models in healthcare is due to the incorporation of advanced mathematical tools into the modelling process. For example: the human capital model merges economics and optimization techniques to better understand human behaviour; system dynamics has utilized the theory of differential equations to model hospital bed usage; and queueing theory has used stochastic calculus to model waitlists for surgery. The proposed research will apply mathematical modelling techniques to help provide a better understanding of the issues in healthcare.



Incorporating advanced mathematical tools into the modelling of healthcare is only the first step. The second step will be to apply advanced optimization techniques onto these models in order to determine things such as optimal intervention strategies and minimal operating budgets (while maintaining specific levels of service).  This step is relatively new to the area of healthcare, but has been highly successful in other fields.  The proposed research will explore how recent tools from optimization can be used to help analyze mathematical models and develop new tools and algorithms for optimization in healthcare.

"The E. coli that cause enteric diseases are divided into pathotypes, based on their virulence factors and mechanisms by which they cause disease. One of these pathotypes, called Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), refers to those strains of E. coli that produce at least one member of a class of potent cytotoxins called Shiga toxin. STEC, especially those of serotype O157:H7, are important emerging pathogens causing food-borne infections leading to bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). However, non-O157 strains are also isolated from people with diarrhea or HUS. In contrast, certain STEC serotypes recovered from animals and food have never been associated with severe human disease. Prevention of infection in humans is a major undertaking that requires the development of new tools to detect STEC in farm animals, along the food chain and in end products. As not all STEC are pathogenic it is essential to characterize specific molecular markers in strains that represent a threat to human health. Once identified, these markers will be developed into a molecular tool(s) for early detection of pathogenic STEC contamination in food. In the long term this would permit the development of potential preventive and therapeutic strategies. Therefore, the aim of our research to characterise the virulence factors involved in STEC pathogenesis and to study their regulatory mechanisms. We will focus on genomic and post-genomic approaches to identify new candidates for inclusion into our improved diagnostic tools, safety monitoring and preventive strategies.","Agriculture and primary food production","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Food and Bioproducts"
"Our research program focuses on studies of the regulation of expression of virulence factors in strains of E. coli that are responsible for extraintestinal and intestinal infections in animals. Specialised regulation systems controlling the expression of virulence factors are complex and essential for the survival of bacteria.



The long-term objective of our research program is to understand the molecular basis of the expression of different virulence factors of pathogenic Escherichia coli in animals. The short-term objectives are: 1- to study the molecular mechanisms of regulation of expression of F1651 fimbrial genes and its phase variation; and 2- to understand the interplay between the Pho regulon (including the Pst system) and E. coli virulence. Achieving these objectives will permit us both to outline the molecular interactions between foo operon coding for F1651 and the different regulators, and to identify the roles that leucine and alanine play in these interactions. Our studies will shed light on the role of the Pst and the Pho regulons in the pathogenicity of bacteria and will help to determine which bacterial components involved in virulence are influenced by this system.

An important key to understanding bacterial survival is to know how these organisms control the expression of genes that are differentially used in response to changing environmental conditions. This will permit us to develop tools (other than antibiotics) to counter diseases caused by these bacterial pathogens. It is certain that these regulation systems are potential targets to develop anti-infectious therapies as alternatives to antibiotics.

"Global climate change is having two important effects on the world's oceans: 1), sea surface temperature is increasing due to the greenhouse effect, and 2) the acidity of the oceans is increasing due to excess carbon dioxide. These two changes will have far-reaching consequences for marine species, many of which are ecologically, economically, and culturally valuable in Canada. For example, rising temperatures are causing species ranges to shift to higher latitudes and deeper waters, and rising acidity is beginning to limit growth rates in species that build shells or skeletons out of calcium carbonate (e.g. corals and molluscs).



My research program will investigate the effects of climate change on rocky shores, which are excellent systems for climate-related research because environmental effects such as temperature are already very important, and because intertidal plants and animals are easy to manipulate. My research in the intertidal zone addresses two fundamental questions: 1) how will marine organisms respond to changes in temperature and carbon dioxide / pH, and 2) how will climatic impacts on one or a few key species regulate community structure? To address the first question, I am manipulating temperature and carbon dioxide concentrations in the laboratory to determine their effects on the growth and reproduction of marine organisms. To address the second question, I am using a combination of field and laboratory manipulations to examine the effects of rising temperature and carbon dioxide concentrations on interacting groups of species (e.g. predatory sea stars and their mussel prey). By manipulating both environmental variables and species interactions, I will be able to determine how climate effects on a limited number of key species may determine the overall impact of climate change in coastal marine habitats.

"Networks must accommodate a wide range of applications. These applications may have different resource requirements (e.g.  bandwidth) and different performance expectations (e.g. limited loss or limited delay) and therefore, effective resource management is an essential element of providing network services. Wireless networks provide flexible deployment even in harsh environments, however, designing services for these networks is often challenging due to increased potential for loss and resource constraints on energy and processing capability.   In this proposal, my research encompasses the design of network topology, routing protocols and access control mechanisms in order to provide quality of service and reliability for different applications in wireless sensor, ad hoc and personal area networks.  Three research projects are proposed:



       a) For line-of-sight sensor networks I will design topologies (placements of sensors) that   provide robustness and design routing protocols that improve reliability for different application scenarios with single and multiple sinks.

       b) For shared-medium ad hoc and sensor networks, I will develop reliable routing and medium access control protocols to provide reliability and quality of service to different applications.

       c) I will develop efficient routing and scheduling mechanisms for the internetworking of wireless networks to meet different application requirements.



The role of a network is to provide services to applications and the proposed research is the key to providing efficient services in the challenging environment of wireless networks.

"This program concerns the interface between the theory of integrable systems and the spectral theory of random matrices. The motivation for this work derives from the very wide applicability of results from random matrix theory in diverse areas of physics. Amongst the most prominent are: its relation to growth phenomena, both deterministic and stochastic; the computation of correlation functions in super Yang-Mills theory; problems of graphical enumeration, two dimensional quantum gravity, and conformal models.

     The tools used are drawn mainly from the inverse spectral methods developed in the study of integrable systems. The relation between the two topics lies in the fact that parameters appearing in the measure defining random matrix ensembles and those determining the support set may be viewed as dynamical deformation parameters. The statistical quantities studied in random matrix theory satisfy systems of partial differential and difference equation with respect to these parameters that turn out to be exactly of the type entering in the theory of integrable systems.

    One main objective of this program is to extend to the multi-matrix setting the nonlinear asymptotic methods that have been so successfully applied in studying the large N asymptotics of the one-matrix case. We are in a position to extend this approach to the multi-matrix case since the Riemann-Hilbert characterization of the underlying biorthogonal polynomials is known, and so is the ""model solution"", in terms of the usual analytic tools used in the function and deformation theory on Riemann surfaces.

   Another approach that is being developed is based on free fermion quantum fields, stemming from the early work of the Kyoto school on integrable hierarchies. This method has been successfully used so far for computing character expansions of two-matrix and complex matrix integrals, as well as rational correlations functions of characteristic polynomials. These results should admit extensions to more general matrix groups, as well as to multi-matrix models.

"Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of physics that describes the strong nuclear force.  The strong force is responsible for binding together protons and neutrons to form atomic nuclei.  However, we now know that protons and neutrons themselves are made up of even smaller particles known as quarks and so, in this light, the strong force ought to be thought of as the interaction responsible for binding quarks together.  Particles like protons and neutrons which are comprised of quarks are collectively referred to as hadrons, and, in the last 75 years, loads of new hadrons have been discovered.  A major goal in particle physics today then is to predict hadron properties from known properties of quarks.  This is a lot tougher than it sounds!  The whole is not simply the sum of the parts here.



Currently, my main research interests are in trying to compute masses of hadrons using our current understanding of the quarks that comprise them.  I plan to address this problem using two distinct but complementary approaches.  The first is called lattice QCD and involves running calculations on a supercomputer.  The second technique, QCD sum-rules, is more of of a pencil and paper (and personal computer!) approach to the problem.



Computing hadron masses is a central outstanding problem in QCD, and a solution would greatly contribute to our fundamental understanding of the universe.

"Boundary structure affects flows of energy, material and organisms across transitions between adjacent ecosystems on the landscape. Differences in the characteristics of edges including structue may depend on factors such as forest type or the type and age of edge. My research program includes studies on the structure, dynamics and function of natural forest edges. Research will be conducted near Churchill, Manitoba and in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. My short term projects include a comparison of forest edges of different structure in different types of forest, an investigation of the process of deadwood decomposition at forest edges and the establishment of permanent plots to investigate temporal dynamics of boundaries. The proposed research will provide insight into how boundary structure affects patterns and processes at forest edges, evaluate older fire edges as a reservoir for deadwood on the landscape and initiate important long-term research on the temporal dynamics of natural boundaries. Results from these studies will contribute towards my long-term goal of developing an analytical model that predicts the effects of stand and landscape-level charactistics on boundary structure and function. An understanding of the landscape patterns and processes is important as a context within which to assess the impact of forest management practices, hydroelectric development and climate change. This knowledge will greatly advance the field of landscape ecology which currently lacks specific information on natural edges. Canada will benefit from a greater understanding of landscape patterns and processes in the boreal forest, especially as it relates to sustainable forest management and climate change.","Advancement of knowledge","Evolution & Ecology"
"This research aims to substantially advance the understanding of energy conversion processes within cells of the body. Energy conversion processes in cells is far from perfect - though the mechanisms are very poorly understood. For example, it is known that the conversion of energy in the form of glucose to the 'universal energy currency of cells', adenosine triphosphate, is inefficient due to a process called mitochondrial proton leak. The mechanisms underlying proton leak are not well understood, but proton leak may account for up to 50% of the resting energy metabolism in muscle. Mitochondria are indeed the 'power-houses' of cells, responsible for a wide range of metabolic processes, including ATP synthesis. Over the last decade, it has been convincingly demonstrated that mitochondria are not the static oblong-shaped structures depicted in many textbooks. In fact, they are constantly undergoing fusion and fission cycles. Recent evidence suggests that mitochondrial structure impacts efficiency. Also affected is the production of free radicals/ reactive oxygen species. The proposed research will specifically examine the effects of mitochondrial fusion on efficiency and oxidative stress. Implications thus extend to obesity and aging.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Integrative Animal Biology"

"This research is to understand chemical reactions that take place at electrode surfaces. A knowledge of what is happening at the molecular level enables improvement of electrochemical devices such as fuel cells whose operation occurs via surface reactions. One part of this research involves looking at simple molecules adsorbed (attached) to the surface, finding out exactly where they are located, in what geometry and how strongly they are attached. In this work, we use single-crystal electrodes, in which the exact locations of the atoms in the surface are controlled and known. Therefore we can extract the maximum level of detail about how the molecules are bonded to the surface.

     In the second part of the research, we look at more complicated reactions, such as the electrochemical oxidation of ethanol. Ethanol is a fuel that can be produced from agricultural sources and then used in a fuel cell to generate electricity, thereby reducing our reliance on oil for our future energy needs. It is more complicated than the established fuel cell fuels such as hydrogen and methanol, and therefore requires development of new methods to understand the complicated ways in which it interacts with the surface. Looking at which molecules are on the surface is only part of the problem. The molecule splits up and makes many products, some of which are soluble and leave the surface. It is important to identify these and find out how to adjust the conditions of the surface to optimize the desired product.

     We will develop new microfluidic electrochemistry techniques to characterize the complex chemistry. In the simplest variation, the molecules are flowed down a very thin channel where they pass electrodes at different voltages. The first electrode carries out the reaction, and the downstream ones act as detectors, capturing and counting the molecules produced at the first electrode. Because the channel is very thin, the capture is very efficient and the detection process is very sensitive.

"One of the dominant areas of astrophysics now is to understand the era of galaxy formation:  how did the galaxies that we see in the universe around us today form and grow?  How is it continuing today?  The major part of my program is aimed at exploring the very oldest stellar populations in nearby galaxies.  These objects -- the globular clusters and halo field stars -- are the visible traces of the very earliest beginnings of their parent galaxies.  My program will use a combination of imaging and spectroscopy with a wide range of telescopes to probe features of these stellar populations that are the most sensitive indicators of the formation process:  their heavy-element enrichments, ages, and spatial distributions.  New collaborations with theoreticians will run in parallel to generate formation models specially tuned to these features of galaxies.



A new part of my research program will also be directed toward studying the medium-redshift universe within which a large fraction of the cosmological structure we see around us in today's universe were formed, especially clusters of galaxies.  Deep imaging will be used to probe further into these galaxy cluster populations, concentrating on search and characterization of the dwarf galaxies that are the building blocks of the larger structures.



All of these areas are ones in which Canadian leadership has been traditionally strong and continues to be so.  Many of the new observations and measurements that are part of my new program are targetted to Canadian-partnered observatories (Gemini and CFHT).

"Natural products have an enormous impact on all of our lives: they include, or form the basis of, many of the antibiotics, cholesterol-lowering statins, immunosuppressants, and other therapeutic agents in use today.  Our research program aims to understand how these small organic compounds are made by the producing organisms, be they bacteria, fungi, or plants.  Knowledge of the assembly of these metabolites in vivo aids not only in the control of pharmaceutical production, but also holds promise for creating new structures not found before in nature: these have potential as the drugs of tomorrow.  Another important aspect of generating novel chemical entities as potential drugs is to explore their chemical synthesis.  Our program aims to learn from the natural assembly process how to perform more effective chemistry.  Thus, we have developed a novel method that allows the fatty acid and polyketide classes of natural products to be assembled in the test tube by following the same sequence of events that occurs in nature.  We are developing this method for the general synthesis of polyketide structures.  In another area, we are mimicking the natural formation of beta-lactone natural products; these are relatives of the penicillin antibiotics. A third aspect of natural products that is also being explored in our lab is the mode of action of these compounds.  We are exploring how two classes of compound work; understanding this mechanism of action will allow the development of better drugs.  One class of compound induces apoptosis, i.e. programmed cell death, an area of enormous interest in cancer chemotherapy.  The other class, the beta-lactones, is being investigated as novel anti-fungal agents; there is a great need for improved anti-fungal drugs due to the development of drug-resistant fungal strains.  Our collaborator at McMaster has identified a novel cellular target for attack, a promising result since resistance is rare when new cellular pathways are targeted.  We are providing the natural products and analogues to inactivate this target.","Human pharmaceuticals","Inorganic & Organic Chemistry"
"The distribution, function and survival of cells is dependent on the extracellular matrix (ECM) in multicellular organisms.  The cells that synthesize and deposit ECM, primarily collagen, are the fibroblasts.  Osteoblasts are fibroblasts which are chiefly responsible for creating the bone matrix.  Osteoblasts once differentiated, secrete one hundred times more collagen then other ECM-making fibroblasts.  Enormous collagen intracellular trafficking must occur within the osteoblast to accomplish this task, yet this area remains largely unexplored.   Our lab is specialized in studying vesicle trafficking of proteins in living cells using fluorescent microscopy.  We aim to examine early collagen (procollagen) delivery through the endomembrane compartments to the cell surface where it is deposited extracellularly.  Our goal is to understand the molecular mechanism behind procollagen trafficking, particularly which Rab GTPases, specify delivery and secretion of procollagen in osteoblasts.  Rab GTPases act as molecular switches and dictate where vesicles are delivered in the cell.  These proteins have never been studied in osteoblasts and we will first screen which Rab GTPases are expressed in differentiated osteoblasts using mass spectrometry coupled with proteomics and microarray analysis for gene expression profiling.  Expressed Rabs and procollagen will then be monitored in vivo by expressing fluorescent-chimeric proteins in osteoblasts and live confocal imaging.  Candidate Rab proteins will be down-regulated by expression of mutant Rab constructs and procollagen trafficking will be visualized using immunofluorescence.  We will also use scanning and transmission electron microscopy to see the effect of mutant Rab expression on procollagen processing in osteoblasts.  These studies will reveal molecular insight into osteoblast function, and given its critical role in ECM production, will be of broad interest to cell biologists.

"We now know that traditional antibiotics are losing their effectiveness against ever-evolving bacteria. This fact is because traditional antibiotics work against specific targets within the bacterial cell, and with bacterial mutations over time, the antibiotic no longer works as well.



Now, researchers are looking at other areas of nature for help, including antimicrobial peptides. These are short proteins that are part of the immune systems of many animals, and some of the peptides attack bacteria directly at the membrane of the cell, causing the bacterium to rupture and die. Since the membranes of most bacteria share common structural features, and these features are unlikely to evolve much, these peptides should effectively kill many types of bacteria without so much evolved resistance.



But why do these peptides kill bacterial cells, but not the cells of the host animal? For Gram-negative bacteria, the most likely reason is that their outer membrane is made of lipopolysaccharides, which is very different from an animal cell membrane.



At this point, what we know about how these peptides work was likely done with models of animal cell membranes, and not with the more complex lipopolysaccharides. If we want to make better peptides, ones that we can use to fight all types of infection, we need a more accurate molecular picture of how they work. This research applies neutron diffraction to measure the structure of lipopolysaccharides and antimicrobial peptides together in action, the result of which will be a 3D atomic model of how these peptides work. We can then compare our picture with what biochemists have come to understand makes for a good antibiotic peptide, and hopefully design better treatments for bacterial infections.

I study this relationship between sex and genetics in a group of sea stars (called asterinids or cushion stars) that have evolved an astounding variety of reproductive traits such as high-risk sexual behaviour involving the release of vast numbers of tiny eggs and sperm; brood protection and live birth; sibling cannibalism; sex-change; and self-fertilization. Some cushion stars have combinations of these traits that should allow them to avoid inbreeding (and its bad consequences for fitness), but might also subject them to intense sexual selection due to competition among males to fertilize the eggs of females. Other cushion stars have other combinations of these traits that should relax this kind of sexual selection (because males are also females, and fertilize their own eggs), but also predispose them to very strong inbreeding (because the parents mate with themselves, and their offspring rarely move between populations). My research is designed to understand how these sexual differences among species affect both inbreeding and sexual selection by looking at different classes of genes that are expected to mainly respond to one or the other process. Because both sexual selection and inbreeding can cause population differences that lead to the formation of new species, an understanding of the role of these two processes can help us understand speciation and the origins of biodiversity. The results are also interesting and important for other areas of research, including animal breeding and human population biology, in which both inbreeding and sexual selection are important (sometimes competing) evolutionary processes.

"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are important root symbionts that confer many benefits to plants and ecosystems.  Although these fungi are spread by humans, little is known about their ability to establish and persist in novel ecosystems.  This is a problem because not only do they move as a consequence of human movement and land use, but they are also being applied to managed nd disturbed ecosystems as 'biofertilizer'.  To understand the consequences of this movement, we need to learn more about the basic biology of AMF, including their response to disturbance, their competitive interactions and their ability to invade different systems.  I propose to classify the invasion success of AMF based on differences in their life history strategies, that is, their traits that allow them to colonize, grow and spread.  In addition, the characteristics of the site to be invaded will also be used to predict invasion success.  This knowledge can be used to augment current agricultural/restoration practices, and also to manage landscapes where AMF have been introduced accidentally.

"In central and northern British Columbia (BC), over 1 million hectares of standing timber was submerged during the flooding of land following hydro dam construction. This occurred in the mid-1950s and, for the most part, the timber remains standing in three reservoirs: Ootsa Lake, Williston Lake and Kinbasket Lake. The 'trees' in these lakes are harvested using specialized underwater equipment; the logs are processed as usual by local sawmills. There has been little work on the acoustic properties of wood from BC and around the world. 

  Since there are successful instrument makers in BC, submerged timber may be considered as a source of materials. A current study underway at UNBC has shown submerged timber from Ootsa Lake has similar densities to non-submerged wood; however, the acoustic properties were considerably lower than acceptable for non-submerged wood and wood from Europe and it has been attributed to drying of the wood. It has been recognized in Europe that slower drying (over years) at room temperatures produce an acceptable acoustic property. In this recent study, it appears that the short drying time used reduced the overall acoustic property; a more detailed study is needed to determine why that is the case with submerged wood.

  Therefore, the main objective of this project is to examine the properties of submerged wood that impact the acoustic properties. The acoustic properties are determined by sound wave speed (i.e., by a stress-wave tester) and are mainly influenced by density and anatomical difference (if any). However, since drying may be a contributor to overall acoustic properties, the proposed study will examine the acoustic properties of wood from the three lakes based on drying methods: convection drying, air-drying and vacuum drying with terms of laboratory conditions of 2 months, 9 to 12 months, and longer terms 18 to 24 months. The woods to be considered are spruce, pine and Douglas-fir. 

  This work will ascertain the suitability of submerged wood for use in making musical instruments thereby potentially developing a local secondary wood manufacturing industry.

"The nuclear industry is undergoing a renaissance in Canada with the life extension of the Bruce A and Point Lepreau plants as well as potential new builds in Ontario and Alberta.  A key objective of a nuclear utility is to optimize electricity production and maintain a safety first operation.  Yet nuclear power plants age just as people do and phenomena such as erosion, corrosion, and deformation can affect the performance of components used in the safe production of electricity.  The utilities are required to perform additional maintenance work and safety analyses to correct the ageing problems or reduce reactor power to maintain safety margins.

     The main purpose of this research program is to study the impact of ageing phenomena upon two-phase flow.  Existing ageing phenomena such as flow accelerated corrosion and pressure tube diametral creep is affecting the flow rates, pressure drop, and heat transfer capability of the nuclear power plant.  The flow accelerated corrosion is eroding the walls of the feeder pipes making the surface conditions rougher which inhibits the flow.  Experiments will be performed that will allow the study of the surface roughness ageing effect upon two-phase flow.  Additional work will be done using Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) forces to improve the heat transfer and fluid flow allowing for future development of improved safety devices.

     The information derived in this work can be used as a building block for mechanistic models to improve the performance and safety margins.  The key to this work is the development of advanced neutron radiography and ultrasonic techniques which allow us to visualize two-phase flow inside metal structures.  

     The undergraduate and graduate students studying this work will be trained with a better understanding of nuclear power plants, ageing phenomena, two-phase flow measurement techniques, and modelling techniques.

"My current and future research has two primary goals. The first goal is applications of combinatorial mathematics to practical problems, particularly those involving communication networks. My coauthors and I have worked on several such projects, developing novel results in the areas of peer-to-peer sytems and network coding. The second goal is understanding fundamental problems in combinatorial optimization, particularly those relating to matchings and matroids. My research has developed the fastest known algorithm for several of these classical problems, and made progress on long-standing open problems.



My future research continues to focus on intriguing questions in networking, especially the interaction between network coding and combinatorial optimization. I am also working on several challenging, fundamental optimization problems, including matroid intersection and the traveling salesman problem.

"Plants and photosynthetic bacteria (like the currently well-publicized cyanobacteria) have perfected complex and ingenious molecular machines capable of harvesting light and convert this green, renewable and free energy into chemical energy (energy under the form of complex molecules) that sustains all life on earth with the exception of some bacteria that live at the bottom of oceans. Nature does this with an amazing efficiency and control. Humans too try to build new and ever more efficient solar panels to collect this light and to convert it into electrical energy, instead of burning fossil fuels contributing to the green house effect by releasing the undesired carbon dioxide. This proposal aims at designing new polymeric materials that exploit new units in their backbone with the aim at finding thermally stable materials that will not age too rapidly and are capable to conduct or photoconduct electricity for photovoltalic cell applications (device that convert light into electricity). Similarly, the same investigated materials can also be examined for potential applications for LED (light emitting diodes). A new concept that is exposed in this proposal is that knowing the high efficiency with which nature collects and transports luminous energy, and more importantly why it is efficient, one can now mimic nature with organometallic molecular systems (molecules that contain one or many metals). These target molecules and polymers are reasonably accessible for students enrolled in the MSc and PhD programs or for postdoctoral fellows to prepare and investigate them in a reasonable length of time. This ""organometallic biomimicry"" is a totally new concept that we shall exploit.

"This proposal is an extension of an ongoing program of research on the physiology of GH secretion and action. In postnatal development, GH is secreted from the pituitary gland (at the base of the brain) into the bloodstream, through which it gains access to every tissue in the body. These tissues express receptors that mediate the actions of pituitary GH on cellular growth and differentiation. However, while these 'endocrine' actions of pituitary GH are obligatory for postnatal development, embryonic or fetal growth is thought to be a 'growth-without-GH-syndrome', since it occurs prior to the development of the circulatory system and the differentiation of the pituitary gland. Embryonic or fetal growth is thus thought to be induced locally by tissue growth factors. Growth in the embryo may not, however, be 'paradoxical' since it may be mediated by local actions of GH produced in early embryonic tissues.

    The applicant has recently discovered that GH gene expression is not confined to the pituitary gland and occurs almost ubiquitously in tissues of the chick embryo. 'Autocrine' or 'paracrine' actions of GH (actions in GH-producing cells or neighboring cells, respectively) may therefore regulate embryonic growth.

    In the studies proposed, the applicant will increase or decrease GH status in the neural retina and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of early chick embryos and determine its effects on retinal function and retinal development. Specifically, the effects of retinal GH excess and deficiency on cell survival, proliferation, migration, neurite outgrowth, angiogenesis and synaptogenesis will be determined. The possibility that these actions may be direct or mediated via insulin-like-growth factor (IGF)-1, another tissue growth factor implicated in the 'endocrine' actions of pituitary GH, will also be assessed. The factors regulating retinal GH production or secretion will also be determined. These studies will provide a model for understanding the secretion and action of GH during embryonic or fetal growth, particularly in retinal and neural development.

"When drilling for oil and gas, one of the steps that can be employed is well fracturing. During this procedure, a

fluid is pumped into the ground at high pressure. The high pressure causes fractures to develop deep

underground. The fractures then provide channels through which material can flow relatively quickly and

efficiently to the wellhead. For some geologies, particularly those is western Canada and the northwestern

United States, alkyl phosphates are required as additives to the fracture fluid. Though most of these compounds

are removed after the fracturing process, a portion remains and can contaminate the oil that is produced from

the well.

The presence of these phosphates in crude oils causes problems at refineries, including fouling of distillation

equipment and poisoning of catalysts. These compounds have been implicated in numerous refinery fouling

events, having impacts measured in the millions of dollars due to unplanned shut-downs and/or decreased

lifetimes of components.

Currently, there is no effective technique to quantify individual alkyl phosphates at trace levels in complex

petrochemical samples. In the first phase of this research, analytical tools that are capable of providing detailed

information pertaining to the abundance and the identities of the alkyl phosphates will be developed.

Subsequent phases of the research will exploit this methodology to study species of alkyl phosphates that are

present in crude oils, establish correlations between abundances of individual volatile alkyl phosphates and

equipment fouling rates, and study other aspects of this phosphorus problem.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","RPP Internal Decision Cttee"
"Gas Chromatography (GC) is a crucial analytical tool for identifying and quantifying small organic chemicals. It is widely applied in a diversity of fields including petrochemical, environmental, food, health, fragrances, and forensics. However, new questions in these fields present samples that often have hundreds or thousands of individual compounds (e.g. cigarette smoke analysis). These surpass what GC can deliver. Recently ""multidimensional"" gas-phased separations have emerged as powerful tools for tackling these challenges. Of the multidimensional GC techniques, the single most powerful one is comprehensive two-dimensional GC (GC�GC) which can routinely separate and measure thousands of compounds in a single analysis. 

This technique emerged in the early 1990s, and has allowed for many advances in fields such as environmental assessment and monitoring, forensic sciences, petrochemicals, and health research. However there are still some hurdles that must be overcome before the technique can be exploited to its fullest. The proposed research will advance the frontier of multidimensional separations science instrumentation and theory. We will develop new understanding of molecular separations, allowing us to better identify the components of our sample. Presently, new computational tools are needed to sift through the vast quantities of data that are collected (up to 110 000 000 data points per hour in some cases). We will apply novel statistical techniques to explore this data and convert it into meaningful and useful information. Finally, new commercially-viable instrumentation will be developed for the rapid analysis of target molecules in highly complex mixtures.","Advancement of knowledge","Anal. & Phys. Chemistry"
"In the context of computing and communication devices, platforms are laptops, personal computers (PCs), servers, mobile and smart phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), etc. These are hardware devices, commonly equipped with one or more processors, multiple types of memories, and input-out interfaces. Operating systems and application programs are executed on these platforms to provide computing and/or communication capabilities in various forms. The increasing use and value of the information or data processed by or stored into today's computer and communication platforms has put the latter at the center of many security breaches. In a networked environment, an infected platform can quickly impact devices and systems across the network or a platform compromised through a back-door can be used by an attacker to mine for confidential information or lunch attacks on other platforms connected to the network. Existing solutions such as firewalls and on-device data encryption software typically protect the data as long as the device itself is not compromised, but do little to ensure the integrity of the platform. To this end, we propose to conduct research by jointly considering the integrity of platforms and the protection of data processed by or stored into them. Our work will include the development of efficient and unified crypto-engines, formulation of algorithms for underlying computations, and investigation of hash functions which are all crucial for a platform's integrity and its content protection.","Information and communication services","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Communications and Information"

"Under the general theme of transport phenomena in microelectronics and metals processing, the applicant wishes to carry out fundamental research in two areas of direct industrial importance. These are concerned with: (a) Mathematical and physical modeling of co-deposition of SiO2 and GeO2 in Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition (MCVD) reactors, and (b) ultrasonic de-agglomeration and dispersion of particles in liquid metals and fluids. (a) MCVD reactors are used to commercially manufacture high quality optical fibers. A MCVD reactor consists of a slowly rotating, fire polished, heated silica tube wherein a mixture of gaseous silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4), germanium tetrachloride (GeCl4) and oxygen is introduced. The reaction products of interest are fine particles of SiO2 and GeO2 which deposit onto the inner surface of the tube. After a sufficient number of layers are deposited, the tube is collapsed into a solid preform rod and then drawn into a long thin fiber. The first objective of this work is to develop a transient 3D transport model which will provide temperature, velocity and concentration profiles as well as deposition rates of SiO2 and GeO2 inside the reactor. The second objective is to perform MCVD experiments in an arranged experimental research facility in China. Experimental results will be used to verify modeling results and the model will be appropriately tuned and/or modify to provide satisfactory results. (b) Dispersion and de-agglomeration of powders are required in many processes in the metals, pharmaceutical, chemical, paint and ink industries. Powder of any particle size tends to form agglomerates when being mixed into a liquid. Therefore, effective means of de-agglomerating and dispersing are required to overcome the bonding forces after wetting the micron- or nano-powders. Mathematical and physical models will be developed to explain the ultrasonic dispersion phenomenon of fine particles in fluids.

"I seek NSERC funds to study chromosomes during meiosis. Higher organisms such as humans are diploids.  This means human adults have two complete sets of chromosomes; one set received from the mother and one set is received from the father. The counterpart chromosomes received from each parent are called homologous chromosomes.  For example an individual gets a chromosome #1 from mom and another copy of chromosome #1 from dad.  These two copies of chromosome #1 are called homologous chromosomes.  An individual gets a chromosome #2 from mom and another copy of chromosome #2 from dad, etc.  Diploid organisms therefore have two versions of each of its different chromosomes. 

     Even though diploid organisms have two complete sets of chromosomes, they must only give one complete set (called a haploid set) to their offspring.  Diploid adults produce haploid sets for their gametes.  Gametes from each parent can combine during fertilization to form diploid zygotes.  Meiosis is the specialized nuclear division whereby the chromosome number is reduced (from diploid to haploid number) in anticipation of fertilization. 

     During meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange homologous segments.  The exchanges are vital to the production of functional gametes. I propose to study chromosome organization for the pairing up and exchange processes in the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and to characterize the meiotic function of individual genes. 

     The work can further our understanding of the processes of chromosome pairing and reciprocal genetic exchange. Because these processes are vital to normal sexual reproduction, they are highly conserved.  Understanding meiosis in Arabidopsis can lead to a better understanding of meiosis in both plants and animals.  Errors in meiosis lead to the production of genetically imbalanced gametes that can lead to birth defects or death.  Understanding meiosis can also lead to better strategies for plant and livestock breeding programs.  Thus the proposed research on meiosis could impact upon such diverse problems as crop and livestock improvement, and understanding birth defects in humans.

"Although age and individual differences in cognition are often attributed to differences in capacity (sometimes measured as working memory capacity), this proposal suggests, by contrast, that age, time of day (peak versus off peak), and individual differences in a variety of cognitive domains and especially of retrieving old information are largely the result of the ability to select target information.  We propose that the critical component of selection is actually the down regulation of nonrelevant items rather than the up regulation of target items; the latter we presume to be automatic and so differ little among individuals. We address these assumptions (and competing views) in three streams of research, including in basic attention tasks (project 1), in episodic retrieval (project 2), and in working memory tasks (project 3).  We compare older and younger adults on these processes (and people tested at peak and off peak times of day) with an eye to examining the relative contributions of up and down regulation of distraction to a range of cognitive tasks.  The significance of this work lies in its potential recasting of the nature of memory failures which are popularly seen as failures at encoding (via uploading too little information, or the wrong information - as in only the gist rather than details, or using poor strategies) and as failures of retrieval (via poor cues, low levels of self initiation, poor strategies). This research tests the suggestion that memory failures are, ironically, the product of encoding and subsequently retrieving too much information rather than too little information, with the burden of these effects lying with the failure of an attentional mechanism.

"Adsorbents are commonly used in air and water quality control as well as in gas separation and purification. The capacity and kinetics of an adsorbent to adsorb pollutants and impurities depend on the specific surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution of the adsorbent. Hence the importance of these microstructural properties when developing and testing novel adsorbents. A Surface Analyzer uses physical adsorption of gases to determine specific surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution of materials. The instrument's versatility allows for characterizing a wide variety of porous materials and adsorbents such as, activated carbon, coke, coal, concrete, catalysts, carbon nanotubes, zeolites, and polymers, hence the instrument will be an extremely useful tool for our groups as well as to researchers in many engineering and science disciplines at the University of Alberta. Examples of current research projects that necessitate the Surface Analyzer include: 1) developing novel adsorbents for control of organic vapour emissions, purification of natural gas, and carbon capture; 2) converting oil sands coke into a useful adsorbent for the removal of Naphthenic Acids from oil sands process affected tailings water, and 3) characterising the effect of mercury adsorbents in coal-fired power plants fly ash on properties of concrete. These research projects are of strategic importance to Canada because they help reducing the water and air quality impacts of industrial activities such as the oil sands development, provide lower greenhouse gas emissions through more energy efficient natural gas purification, as well as provide a safe disposal for coal-fired power plants fly ash. The requested Surface Analyzer is essential to proceed with these research projects as it will provide input parameters that are required for determining the performance of adsorption and regeneration processes and will allow assessing the effectiveness of the activation or modification of the adsorbent on its structural and adsorption properties, and the potential for using the adsorbent for air and water treatment applications.

"The emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a serious environmental issue. VOCs react in the atmosphere to form ground-level ozone which causes eye irritation and respiratory problems. In addition, many VOCs may be carcinogenic and/or neurotoxic to humans. Major sources of these emissions include the gas and oil industry and processes using organic solvents, such as surface coatings. In Canada, more than 2.5 million tonnes of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were emitted to the atmosphere in 2005. These emissions are expected to increase to 2.8 million tonnes in 2010 (Environment Canada, 2007). Hence, technologies need to be developed to more efficiently control those emissions, at lower cost and with lower energy consumption. Technologies need also to promote sustainable development through the recycle and reuse of the resources, whenever feasible. 

     Adsorption with regeneration is a desirable means to control the emissions of VOCs as it allows for capture, recovery and reuse of those VOCs. Adsorption with regeneration can be further improved by developing novel adsorbents with higher adsorption capacity, faster adsorption and desorption kinetics, and more energy efficient regeneration.

     This research will decrease the emissions of VOCs in Canada by 1) developing novel adsorbents for use in air pollution control; 2) developing a system that captures and recovers VOCs for recycle; 3) developing a system that stabilize and concentrate VOCs for efficient conversion with incinerators or biofilters, 4) evaluating the performance of the two  systems; and 5) optimizing the design of the two systems.

     Four graduate students will be trained in these areas which are of strategic importance to Canada. Not only ambient air quality will be improved but also the pollutants will be recovered and reused, whenever feasible, to allow for a more sustainable development.

"The proposed research aims at developing advanced control methods for robotic teleoperation systems that are employed to project users' sensing and manipulation abilities to remote or dangerous locations. Telerobotic systems are composed of a force feedback hand-held mechanism (master) with which a local operator interacts, a robot (slave) that is commanded to perform a desired task on a remote environment, and a communication channel through which commands are transmitted. The fundamental challenges in the design of teleoperation control systems reside in dynamic variations and uncertainties in the human arm and unstructured environments, as well as communication delays that significantly compromise performance versus stability. 

   This research involves design, implementation, and evaluation of adaptive and predictive controllers that will incorporate real-time estimates of the operator arm and unknown environment dynamics. Towards this goal, fast model-based algorithms will be developed for online estimation of environment dynamics. In addition, novel computationally feasible algorithms will be devised for online estimation of human arm dynamics. These algorithms use biological and kinematic sensory data collected from the human arm. The advanced impedance reflecting controllers utilizing the online estimates will provide stable operation for a large range of operator and environment dynamics and communication delays of up to the order of seconds.

   The use of the resulting reliable and stable teleoperation systems for dangerous operations such as space extravehicular activities, underwater repairs, mine wall-blasting, or nuclear waste disposal will save lives, and reduce bodily injuries and operational costs. The human arm model will also be used to design novel controllers for upper-arm prostheses and can be employed for the analysis of the human motor system. The fast environment identification algorithms have potential use for fault detection and dynamic payload monitoring in manufacturing and service industry. The proposed research will offer training opportunities in mechatronics and biomedical engineering to four PhD, three Master's, and three summer undergraduate students.

"It is now 40 years since Steven Weinberg published his seminal paper linking ElectroMagnetism and the Weak Interaction which led to the development of the ""Standard Model"" of particle physics. All the data from accelerators, aside from neutrino oscillations, can be explained by the SM but most physicists believe that there is a more fundamental theory beyond the SM since it contains more than 20 arbitrary parameters and it also predicts too small a value for the baryon number resulting from the big bang.    

     The search for the Higgs boson, the fundamental particle which is supposedly responsible for the mass of all the other particles, is currently underway at FNAL and will be soon undertaken at the new 1B$ LHC at CERN. Some new physics is almost certain to be discovered during the next 5 years at this ""high energy"" frontier.

     However, there is another frontier, namely the ""precision"" frontier, which is also being actively pursued for new physics beyond the SM. Such precision experiments are complementary to the production experiments at the high energy colliders. The proposed experiment, which is searching for a T-Violating transverse muon polarization (P_T) in K+ decay, is one such experiment. This process is forbidden in 1st order in the SM and so a non-zero measurement would immediately indicate the presence of some new physics. Indeed, there are predictions from the triplet Higgs model and various SUSY models which come close to reaching the current upper bounds on P_T from our earlier experiment at KEK. We note that P_T is linearly sensitive to the amplitude of any new interaction which could interfere with the higher order SM processes rather than the square of the amplitude (which is the situation in the production experiments). Our proposal is to upgrade our existing detector and use the increased beam intensity at J-PARC to gain at least a factor of 20 improvement in our measurement sensitivity which will validate one of the non-SM theories or at least significantly constrain the parameter space for such extended SM theories.

"The objectives of the proposed research program are to exploit new time-based, rather than conventional voltage based, circuits that we have invented and patented, in a variety of applications. The main building block is a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) that provides a digital output each clock cycle with no delay between input and output. The initial TDC circuits that we have designed, tested and published are dramatically better than existing TDC's used, for example, in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging for medical diagnosis. 



The TDC's have direct application in serializer-deserializer (SerDes) circuits for ""on chip"", chip-to-chip and board-to-board data links in high speed data communication networks. A completely new SerDes system based on the circuits will have many advantages over exisiting systems, including reduced crosstalk, better interference rejection, and reduced clock speed requirements for given data rates. 



When combined with a voltage-to-time front end (VTC), the TDC's can be used to build GigaSample-per-second (GS/s) ADC's whose performance will improve as semiconductor fabrication process feature sizes scale downward, unlike many circuits that suffer from scaling. Another major advantage is that circuit complexity increases only linearly with an increased number of bits n, unlike existing systems whose complexity increases exponentially with n. This saves silicon chip area, which is becoming very expensive, and also reduces dc power consumption, which is important for reducing heat dissipation and extending battery life in mobile applications. The ability to use these types of high speed low power ADC's in wireless receivers will enable ""software radios"", for applications such as multi-standard cell phones that are fully programmable and will work worldwide.

"Software repositories, such as source control and defect tracking systems, represent a detailed historical record of a system. These repositories are no longer used simply for record-keeping activities such as maintaining code versions or tracking defects. Practitioners often examine historical repositories, in an ad hoc fashion, to improve their understanding of a system, or to gauge the state of a project. For example, managers often examine historical changes to estimate the reliability of a project or to determine the need for testing resources. Few researchers investigate enriching their methods with the valuable information in historical repositories. 

            The long term goal of this research program is to systematically uncover the benefits of information in software repositories by empirical exploration. Over the next five years, we will conduct research along the following two dimensions: (1) the recovery and representation of historical information in a simple format to ease access to this information throughout software research and practice and, (2) the development of methodologies and approaches that explore and demonstrate the benefits of such information. 

            We will develop a formal model and language, as opposed to conventional ad hoc methods, to manipulate the historical information. We will use this model to understand and predict code change patterns, such as refactorings, in large projects over the short and long term. We will perform user studies to understand the side effects of adopting mining techniques, as their adoption is likely to affect the historical information on which they are based. We will study the effect of various development activities, such as code browsing and reuse on code expertise, instead of only using historical code change information as done by prior research. 

            This program will directly train three PhD and three MSc students. Students will gain an appreciation of the challenges facing practitioners on a daily basis and the potential of repository data in helping address those challenges. Students will also gain proficiency in validating their research hypotheses using statistical and empirical methods, knowledge valued by both academic and industrial sectors.

"Capacity engineering is concerned with selecting the most appropriate configurations for deploying an application while satisfying performance requirements and financial constraints. When deploying enterprise applications, customers must determine whether their current deployment infrastructure, is over-engineered (then they can reduce deployment costs) or under-engineered (then they can invest more to improve the user's experience). However, customers are given little help when conducting capacity analysis; instead customers often uncover limitations through critical crashes and service degradations of already deployed applications. 



        Capacity analysis is an important yet costly and labor intensive task that is given a cursory focus at the end of a project. A capacity analysis for a given software application requires the execution of a large number of experiments, requiring a lengthy process, on a variety of hardware configurations, requiring a costly lab setup.



        This research project aims to minimize the cost and time associated with capacity engineering efforts by reducing the number of experiments that must conducted and by reducing the number of hardware configurations that should be explored in the experiments. With fewer experiments, capacity analysis activities can be performed within days instead of weeks. With a reduced number of configurations, capacity labs are easier to manage and cheaper to run, due to lower hardware costs and cooling requirements. The results of this research will help companies, like RIM, create and evolve tools, such as capacity calculators, with minimal effort and cost. These tools will assist customers of enterprise applications in their capacity analysis activities and will lead to higher satisfaction for users. The research will train 10 HQP in capacity engineering, an important area of software engineering, for which there is a clear and documented worldwide lack of HQP.

"Tube-and-shell heat exchangers are the workhorse of many industries, including the power, petrochemical, and process industries. These devices contain thousands of tubes and through their walls heat is exchanged between two fluids at different temperatures. Significant amount of kinetic energy arises due to high-speed flow circulating in the shell-side (outside the tubes) of the heat exchanger.  The structural integrity of the tubes can be compromised if only a small fraction of this energy is converted into vibrations. 

The integrity of tube bundles represents a major concern when dealing with high risk industries; a specific case being nuclear steam generators in which one of the fluids is radioactive, and the rupture of a tube or tubes will contaminate the other fluid. The tubes are therefore stiffened by means of supports to avoid vibrations known as fluidelastic instability. Because the tube material expands when heated, spaces known as clearances must be allowed between the tubes and their supports. As the clearances between the tubes and their supports get larger due to progressive tube wear or chemical cleaning, the tubes may begin to hit their supports more frequently. These increased impacts can lead to breakage due to tube fatigue and/or wear at the support locations. 

This research aims to develop computer models that can simulate the flow around tubes under various conditions.  By utilizing these models one will be able to calculate the amount of impact that will occur between the tubes and their supports under different fluid flow conditions. The amount of wear on the tubes can therefore be predicted, which will help in devising guidelines for future designs. Moreover, the models will provide the ability to assess tube wear of in-service heat exchangers, avoiding potentially costly and dangerous breakdowns.

"The objective is to better understand the factors controlling channel stability, sediment transport, sediment storage, channel morphology and bed surface structures of steep mountain streams by integrating field observations, laboratory experiments, and numerical simulation. The proposed work is not only relevant for fluvial geomorphological research, but also for research on river ecology. This coincides with the important provincial goal of land management in British Columbia, which is to minimize the impact of land use on sediment and debris production and delivery to streams.  An understanding of drainage basin dynamics and the origins of channel morphology is a prerequisite for improving river management practices, channel restoration guidelines, and drainage basin management practices.  Firstly, spatial and temporal variability and the shape of the sediment transport-storage relation will be explored in complex field settings (East and Carnation creeks).  Secondly, experiments will be conducted on bed surface structures and channel stability under episodic sediment supply and variable flow hydrographs.  Thirdly, sediment transport will be numerically simulated to reproduce the observations in East Creek and to explore the sensitivity of various controlling factors (e.g., channel storage, bed armouring, sediment supply, hydrologic conditions). The final outcome is a model that incorporates adequate physical description of the process of sediment transport and storage under a wide range of sediment supply regimes, bed compositions (texture and structure), and varying flow regimes.","Earth sciences","Environmental Earth Sciences"
"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have recently been receiving a growing amount of interest, both within the research and the commercial communities. Their applications exist across residential, commercial, not-for-profit and public sectors. They have paved the way to new monitoring and control possibilities. Since WSNs have displayed great versatility, emerging applications are demanding the use of WSNs in harsher environments. This harshness can be either due to inaccessible terrain, to the practicality of traditional installments, to hazardous and life threatening consequences, or to other conditions such as extreme levels or variations of temperature, humidity, mobility or vibration. The reliability of the communication medium is also a factor when heavy rain or sand storms occur, or when the network is deployed in certain soil structures such as oil sands, volcanoes or sliding mud. Network operations for WSNs in harsh environments need to be maintained despite faults affecting either single or multiple sensors. The objective of this research is to design WSNs that are inherently robust and reliable, able to withstand the unpredictable and faulty nature of harsh environments. Our approach will also maximize the benefit of sensors where they can still be used despite partial failure. Network functions, such as routing and task allocation, will also be able to sustain various forms of failures imposed by the loss of nodes in the harsh environment. This research will provide benefits to academic and industrial technology and environmental sectors, particularly those where mission-critical deployments in harsh environments were previously impossible. Increasing the reliability and range of WSNs will directly benefit the Canadian WSN manufacturing, programming and deployment industrial sector, providing them with a unique ability to install robust WSNs that are sustainable in harsh environments and maintain network objectives.We anticipate that five graduate students will be trained throught this project: three PhD students and two Master's students. The practical, state-of-the art network design experience gained by students involved in this research is in high demand in the industrial sector.

"Internet users are increasingly using interactive services such as multimedia messaging, social networks (e.g., facebook, myspace), sharing (e.g., torrents) and collaborative applications (e.g., wiki pages). Emerging services (e.g. telemedicine or telepresence) are also gaining popularity. Simultaneously, Internet users are becoming more and more mobile, and are growingly interested in maintaining full access to their services mix while on the go. Together, these developments are straining current architectures for service delivery in wireless and mobile networks, which were not designed to handle large and highly variable information transfer, accommodate dynamic mobility and employ isolated service management platform. They are also mostly static and impersonal in their management as they do not adapt to individual user requirements, habits or surroundings. The objective of this proposed research is to promptly provide the Canadian telecommunications sector (service providers, service developers, vendors) with wireless and mobile networks that enable the realization of future mobile Internet. The project, involving collaboration with Nortel Networks, comprises three complementary components. The first aims at establishing means to seamlessly combine different wireless access technologies and structures, in addition to different service deployment and management platforms. The second component aims at establishing design and operation guidelines of robust and opportunistic networks that can handle the highly dynamic requirements of future services and their QoS while exploiting variations in network and medium conditions. The third component is to instill - by design - adaptability in wireless and mobile service delivery by increasing awareness to user's context, location and environment, and facilitating collaborative and peer-to-peer applications over wireless. The research will result in cost-efficient, profitable and capable architectures for service deployment, management and delivery that will ensure and consumer satisfaction.","Information and communication services","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Communications and Information B"

Together, these developments are straining current architectures for service delivery in wireless and mobile networks.

   Our long-term goal will be to establish a foundation that will integrate disparate access technologies, infrastructure modes and service management platforms in a seamless and transparent manner to enable seamless and ubiquitous quality of service (QoS) based communication.

The research will result in cost-efficient, profitable and capable architectures for service deployment, management and delivery that will ensure consumer satisfaction. 

   Training of highly qualified personnel involved in this program will include experience in broadband multimedia support, QoS support and resource management, software-defined radios, multi-hop networking and heterogeneous networks. I expect that seven PhD and seven Master's students will receive training through in this research program. There is a strong demand for these HQP in the information technology and telecommunications sectors and their future employment will accelerate disseminating next-generation communications technology to Canadian industry.

"One of the most challenging problems of managing supply chains is dealing with variability in demand and supply. At heart is the task of matching supply to demand so as to avoid having excess inventory or shortages. The cost of the latter can be extreme to the point that it could mean temporary closure of plants and potentially

managers layoffs. To address this problem the research community has, historically, adopted a two-pronged approach for matching supply to demand: The first is in the field of operations research where the focus is mainly on managing inventory while assuming prices are exogenously determined and the second is in the fields of economics and marketing where the emphasis is on controlling prices, independently of inventory. Likewise in the practitioner's world, pricing and inventory decisions are taken independently each by the marketing and operations department, respectively. Nowadays, with the possibility brought by information technology and the advent of integrated supply chain management practices, there is a recognition, by researchers and practitioners alike, of the need to jointly optimize prices and inventory decisions.

Thus, the goal of this proposed research is to study the role that pricing plays in managing supply and demand in a supply chain. From the supply side we will focus on procurement  auctions where we will view auctions as one extreme of pricing in which the bidder (supplier) has ample flexibility in setting the price. From the demand side we will focus on how a retailer can manage customers demand by jointly setting optimal pricing and stocking decisions. 

In addition to training graduate students, it is hoped that this research will contribute to the competitiveness of Canadian companies by efficiently managing their spending and aligning their demand with their supply. The importance of studying these issues becomes evident when we know that the cost of procured goods and services is estimated to be about 80% of the cost of manufacturing. This importance is further emphasized by the recent trend in outsourcing: it is expected that 50% of manufacturing activities will be outsourced by 2010.

"Anthropogenic activity is increasing the atmospheric loading of particulate matter.  This shows up in a number of environmental issues.  Particles degrade visibility, which has aesthetic, economic (tourism) and aircraft safety implications.  They have an impact on climate but the exact impact is not well understood.  Since the particles can penetrate into the bronchial tract and lungs they also have an effect on human health.  Studies from a variety of countries reveal significant correlations between particulate matter loading and mortality, cardiorespiratory hospitalisation, bronchitis, and decreased lung function. 



As part of the effort to understand the sources of particulate matter to the atmosphere, I will undertake laboratory studies on the production of atmospheric particles from the reactions of hydrocarbons.  Reactions of atmospheric importance will be performed in a 9 cubic meter smog chamber. The yield of particulate, the equilibrium between the gas and particulate phases, and the chemical composition of the particulate will be followed. These results would be invaluable in producing particulate modules for inclusion in climate and air quality models.

"The goal of this research is to understand the evolution and function of an important but imperfectly-understood gene expression mechanism - SL trans-splicing.  SL trans-splicing is a form of RNA splicing, which is an important step in the expression of most genes in complex organisms or cells.  However, unlike conventional RNA splicing, which cuts out segments from a single RNA molecule and joins them back together, in trans-splicing segments of two entirely independent RNA molecules are joined together.  Conventional RNA splicing is universal among complex organisms, but SL trans-splicing, though widespread, is not found in every group.  The distribution indicates that SL trans-splicing either arose independently several times during evolution, or it has been lost several different times.  One of the goals of this research program is to determine which of these hypothetical scenarios is correct. These studies will be focussed on the major branch of the animals that includes humans, because, although humans and other higher vertebrates do not carry out SL trans-splicing, we recently discovered that SL trans-splicing does occur in our closest non-vertebrate chordate relatives, the tunicates.  We will assess the distribution of SL trans-splicing among the major groups of vertebrates/chordates, and also in several other phyla that, along with the chordates, make up the major animal division termed the deuterostomes.  The results will enable us to determine whether SL trans-splicing arose within the tunicates, or was lost within the vertebrates.  We will also carry out experimental studies in tunicates to clarify the genetic functions of trans-splicing in the chordates.  The information from this research will provide useful insight into the evolutionary dynamics of gene expression mechanisms and on the impact of evolutionary change in gene expression mechanisms on the evolution of the genome.

"I will investigate the behaviour of chalcophile (copper-like) elements in subduction zones where arc volcanoes form. Such elements have an affinity for sulphur in shallow crustal rocks, and include many metals that are necessary for our society, such as copper.  Most rocks consist largely of silicates, and the chalcophile elements are present in only trace concentrations. Metal deposits that are economic to mine occur in volcanic arcs that are formed where oceanic rocks are subducted. This spatial association between metal deposits and subduction zones indicates a linkage; however, metal behaviour at great depths, where subduction causes melting of rocks that leads to arc volcanism, is little known. In past research, my team has shown that oxidized magmas contain high concentrations of sulphur and metals, and that the oxidation state reflects the nature of the underlying mantle. The discharge of huge amounts of SO2 from Mt. Pinatubo, Philippines, was a consequence of the highly oxidized mantle below the volcano. We have also shown from work in the Himalayas and S. America that the mantle oxidation condition is affected by the subducted material. The mantle has low sulfur, requiring the large discharge of sulfur from volcanoes to be supplied from the subducted plates. My research will help to answer several questions: How are sulfur and metals transferred from the subducting plate to the mantle, then to magmas that may erupt, and how do these metals occur in the S-poor mantle? For our research, we will study three types of rocks; those that have been deeply subducted and brought back to the surface, pieces of mantle that were uplifted during mountain building, and mantle fragments that were brought to the surface by explosive volcanoes.

     The project will contribute to targeting the regions that may contain major metal deposits, and volcanoic regions that dangerously discharge SO2. Students participating to this project gain valuable research experience and theoretical and practical knowledge in geoscience that are not available in classrooms and useful in their career advances.

"The main objective of this proposal is to develop novel, sustainable, environmentally-friendly, polymer based nanocomposites by combining controlled-microstructure biodegradable polymers with chemically treated (kraft) pulp fibers, and fluff pulp fibers (precursor to regenerated cellulose fibers like Lyocell) produced by Papprican. The biodegradable polymers of controlled microstructure will be synthesized using novel techniques recently developed and others under development at the department of Chemistry at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and these are poly(caprolactone), poly(lactic acid), and poly(hydroxybutyrate). Existing biodegradable polymer products suffer from a limited scope of physical properties, which could be enhanced with novel polymer formulations, including the combination of biodegradable polymers and/or block co-polymers with wood fibers to result in completely compostable polymers with a wide range of mechanical characteristics. Enhancing these mechanical properties of bio-polymers to make them comparable to those of many petroleum-based plastics and developing innovative technologies to make their production cheaper would be a first and important step for developing the next generation of green materials. Additives known as processing aids should be designed to enhance their processabilitiy to high production levels. This study also points to the need of studying the structure-property relationship from the rheological point of view in order to better understand relationships between molecular structure-rheology-processing and compostability for a better design of the final products. The significance of this research points in multiple directions. Firstly, it aims to protect the environment by addressing the synthesis and modification of new biodegradable polymers for the preparation of compostable plastics (sustainability). Secondly, it points to energy savings by reducing the demand for the production of new polymers, at least petroleum-based plastics. Finally, it is an integral study of the full life cycle of a class of materials beginning from their synthesis/genesis to processing and applications and finally their full decomposition/composting.","Polymers, rubber and plastics","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Manufacturing"

The main focus will be on polylactic acid (PLA) polymers which can be produced naturally from starch in corn, wheat and potatoes. There is a large number of commercially available biopolymer and the demand is expected to rise nearly 20% through 2010. Various types of naturally derived PLAs will be studied derived from various renewable resources. In addition their performance will be compared with chemically synthesized PLAs (collaboration with the department of chemistry at UBC). Starches are used as fillers in the paper making industry and are massively produced and thus readily available in Canada.

"A major objective of future generation communication networks is to provide high quality multimedia content to users. This demand necessitates more efficient utilization of fundamental, however often limited resources such as power and spectrum. While it is essentially to minimize consumption of limited resources, the conservation should not come at the cost of inferior quality of service (QoS). Thus, power and spectrum efficient strategies, which can also quarantee some level of QoS, are highly desirable.



We argue that, with the increasing scarcity of power and spectrum in communication networks, a paradigm shift is required in designing systems: adaptability and variability are implemented at each system level, which furthermore need to be coordinated appropriately between the various system levels for maximum efficiency. For example, we are interested in minimizing resource consumption, while not suffering from adverse delays. After all, if a proposed system is efficient but whose optimality requires long delays, then its advantages may not be appreciated by the end users. Indeed, for many multimedia communication applications, e.g. real time video, delay requirements are usually stringent and need to be a high-priority QoS consideration.



We propose a generalized framework of resource allocation, which enables efficient integration of various adaptation methods and  strategies: efficient use of  available bandwidth and power, adaptive modulation and coding coping with highly varying wireless channel conditions, as well as an integrated and multilayer design paradigm for overall performance gain. Depending on the envisioned application, a pre-selected level of QoS can be guaranteed while keeping resource consumption to a minimum. Together, these strategies offer an attractive communication framework of increased power and spectral efficiency, which in turn enable high-data-rate  wireless multimedia communication to be an affordable  and practical reality.

"Understanding the evolution of cooperation represents a core challenge to evolutionary biology and was recently selected among the 25 most important unresolved scientific questions published in Science. Cooperation is ubiquitous in nature, ranging from bacterial colonies to human societies. However, cooperation is a conundrum, whereas exploitation is not. Cooperators incur costs and provide benefits to others, whereas cheaters reap the benefits but avoid the costs. Hence, Darwinian selection should favour cheaters, despite the fact that groups of cooperators are better off than groups of cheaters. The problem of cooperation reduces to a conflict of interest between the group and the individual. Much theoretical and experimental effort has been expended to investigate mechanisms capable of resolving the dilemma and supporting the evolution of cooperation. Based on the mathematical framework of evolutionary game theory, this proposal aims at extending our understanding of three distinct mechanisms. First, investigating the interplay between ecological and evolutionary dynamics will enhance our theoretical understanding of evolutionary processes. In spatial settings, the feedback between ecology and evolution appears to support cooperation by initiating stable spatial heterogeneity in population densities and suggests a possible mechanism for spontaneous habitat diversification. Second, the concept of spatial extension is readily generalized to arbitrary population structures and, in particular, to social networks. Social interaction patterns are not static but change over time. Understanding the dynamics and the emerging structures of social networks creates promising opportunities to study form and function, for example, of virtual communities, such as eBay, Wikipedia or public forums. Third, the role of punishment, reward and reputation in enforcing or encouraging cooperation is modeled and related to human and animal populations. In a human context, this provides an evolutionary perspective on the establishment of sanctioning institutions as well as on the reasons for building most human societies on punishment instead of on socially more appealing rewarding mechanisms.

"Human beings act in and interact with their social environment.  Accordingly, it is of special importance not only to understand other individuals' actions, goals, and desires, but also to be able to perform one's own actions, to achieve goals, and to express desires.  Understanding other people's actions and knowing how those actions can be linked to our own actions is crucial to our social interaction.  Infants are more interactive than one might think.  They have intense exchanges with their environment long before they can ever talk; and it seems that infants are especially interested in learning about actions - others', their own and the outcomes of them.  In their first year of life, they learn about actions while watching others and their own actions affect how interested they are in those made by others.  Understanding this two-way relationship is a key to more advanced understanding of actions, goals and communication.  The proposed research program will focus on this relationship.  Especially, it will look at how infants' perceptual and motor development affects how they perform their own actions and how they learn to understand the actions others make.  Actions are something special for humans and, above all, infants are interested in biological partners.  This research program will look at infants' knowledge about biological movements, like grasping, crawling, and walking.  How is this knowledge related to what they are able to do on their own?  When infants start to move on their own, they discover new possibilities and new features of their surroundings.  Research will concentrate on the relationship of new motor skills to more general capacities.  Use of eye-tracking and video technology will enable research of how features of action understanding, motor development, and body knowledge are linked to infants' cognitive development.

"Canada is a world leader in the production of the two key oilseed crops Canola and linseed flax. Despite their significant contributions to the Canadian economy, the processing of both crops demonstrates sub-optimal use of the biological material: oil is produced through the crushing of seeds with the remaining seed hulls being largely disposed of as waste by-products. We propose to enhance the economic value of these key oilseed crops by converting these waste hulls to valuable co-products through the production of novel bioproducts in the seed coat epidermal ceils. These mucilage secretory cells (MSCs) produce massive quantities of pectinaceous mucilage that is released following hydration, making these cells excellent biofactories from which novel products can be easily isolated. In order to harness these biofactories, we will first test and optimize chromoprotein targeting to the MSCs in Arabidopsis, then express the proteins in Canola and linseed flax in collaboration with Performance Plants and Agriculture and Agri-Foods Canada, respectively. These chromoprotein constructs will have direct application as an easily visible marker for detecing adventitious presence of transgenic seeds in non-transgenic lots, an important biosafety concern. Our experiments will include the identification and construction of seed coat-specific promoters that will serve as a resource for the research community for tissue-specific expression and containment of products within the seed coat. Our work will support the bioeconomy and Canada's current research priorities through providing a platform for the production of novel co-products in key biorefinery crops. Finally, this collaboration between academic, industrial and government research laboratories will lead to the training of personnel who will be well-poised to make significant contributions to the bioeconomy through the pursuit of jobs in research, industry or public policy.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Food and Bioproducts"
"During differentiation of the Arabidopsis seed coat epidermis, a large amount of mucilage, comprised primarily of pectin, is produced and secreted from the cells.  Subsequently an extensive secondary cell wall is synthesized.  Upon exposure of mature seed to water, the mucilage expands to envelop the seed providing protection and moisture prior to germination. Unlike many specialized cell types the seed coat epidermis is not essential for viability, allowing for the isolation of mutants defective in various aspects of its differentiation. Thus, the Arabidopsis seed coat represents an excellent model system for genetic dissection of cell wall biogenesis, especially with respect to pectin. We have been using this system to identify and clone genes encoding proteins needed for mucilage structure and function.  Three of these genes, MUM1, MUM2 and FLY are all required for proper mucilage extrusion from the seed coat when exposed to water.  We believe that investigating the role of these genes will contribute to understanding how plants modulate pectin to produce different physical properties required during growth and development.  Our recent cloning of the MUM2 gene indicates that it encodes a hydrolytic enzyme that modifies the mucilage outside the cell following secretion and may be analogous to processes involved in fruit ripening. MUM1 encodes a transcription factor that may control mucilage extrusion by regulating genes like MUM2 needed to modify mucilage structure.  We are close to cloning the FLY gene. We propose here to 1) continue our analysis of the role of all three of the genes and their protein products, 2) study the biochemical structure of the seed coat mucilage in more detail and 3) isolate and characterize a new generation of seed coat mutants. Upon completion of this work we hope to better understand pectin structure and how it can be modified to alter its physical properties.  This work should generate information and tools needed to manipulate pectin structure and function in vivo.

"The long-term objective of the proposed research program is to develop knowledge, technologies, and highly qualified personnel to foster optimal safety and sustainability of new and ageing civil infrastructure. Public safety - including economic security - depends strongly on civil infrastructure, such as bridges and buildings. In the proposed research, the probability of damage due to deterioration and dramatic loading events enter into total loss curves that are used in decision making. While traditional research has focused on individual structural members, this proposal builds upon recent progress in simulation of global structural performance. In a synergistic endeavor, the emerging BIM-technology in the building industry is utilized to generate sophisticated structural models, including damage to non-structural components. The communication is carried out by extending the Industry Foundation Classes; an ISO standard for interoperability in the building industry. By means of a novel unified reliability approach, these models are considered in conjunction with multiple hazards, including earthquakes and deterioration due to ageing. In one reliability analysis, a regional loss probability is obtained, with identification of critical infrastructure as a valuable by-product. An ""adaptive fidelity"" strategy is put forward to gradually refine the structural models by balancing computational cost and epistemic model uncertainty. In a coordinated effort, probabilistic models for structural performance are calibrated with a Bayesian methodology to explicitly identify the epistemic uncertainty. This work utilizes the extensive structural testing programs that have been undertaken worldwide in recent years. Towards the ultimate objective of allocating resources in a manner that balances cost, safety, and sustainability; existing utility metrics for sustainability are extended in the context of structural engineering.

"Long-distance flight is a very energy-consuming task that relies on lipids as fuel.  Migratory insects and birds have adapted to these demands and developed special mechanisms that assure efficient storage and transport of lipids and fatty acids.  Blood lipoproteins deliver lipids towards storage in fat tissue or oxidation in muscles, while intracellular lipid binding proteins are responsible for the transport of fatty acids within the tissues. The synthesis of these proteins reflects the metabolic demands, and changes depending on the physiological needs (flight, reproduction, growth and development).  We are studying such proteins in both insects and birds, with specific interest in unraveling the mechanisms by which their genes are regulated.  For the extracellular carriers, we focus on members of the large lipid transfer protein (LLTP) superfamily, while the intracellular transporters include fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) and nuclear transcription factors that are activated by lipids.  We have cloned various FABP genes, and identified elements in their promoters that respond to elevated fatty acid levels. This response is mediated by nuclear receptors that bind fatty acids or related compounds. We will identify and characterize these receptors in cell culture. We will determine the DNA sequences they bind to, and search for other genes that are similarly regulated. With respect to extracellular lipid carriers, we will study insect vitellogenin and a related lipoprotein (VHDL). VHDL is a larval specific storage protein that is suppressible by juvenile hormone  (JH), while vitellogenin is an adult, female specific yolk protein precursor that is expressed only in the presence of JH.  Insect larvae and cell lines will be treated with hormone analogs, and gene expression and protein synthesis measured. The regulatory sequences for these genes will be cloned, and receptor binding sites that confer the opposite sensitivity to JH identified. Further research is directed toward the transcription factors involved in this regulation.  Taken together, our research program will shed light on the molecular mechanisms that control the expression of the transport proteins essential for allocation of lipids toward storage, long distance flight, or reproduction in migrating animals.

"As traditional energy supplies become diminished, there is an increasing need for a sustainable production of useful renewable energy. Biological conversion of a plentiful source of energy, plant biomass, to organic fuels, hydrogen, electricity and other useful products, is a viable alternative to fossil fuels. Cellulose, a major component of plant biomass and of cellulosic wastes, can be decomposed by a wide variety of cellulolytic aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and mixed cultures. Microbial cellulose-degrading consortia are complex communities and the contributions of individual consortium members to the functioning of the consortium as a whole are not well understood. Specifically, the carbon flow from the cellulose substrate to various end products is not well elucidated. Previous studies have shown that especially anaerobic microorganisms degrade cellulose most efficiently, when they grow attached to cellulose fibers. We propose to investigate the link between structure and function of complex cellulose degrading communities. Our working hypothesis is that attached microbial growth in the form of a biofilm will facilitate niche formation which can be exploited by microorganisms with different physiological requirements, ultimately leading to a greater metabolic diversity and thus effective cellulose degradation. The long-term objective of the proposed research is to obtain well characterized mixed cultures with the ability to rapidly hydrolyse cellulose and to synthesize value-added products. Strains isolated from such communities will be used to produce ""designer consortia"" which will efficiently degrade cellulose. The results will be relevant both for fundamental research on microbe-substrate

interactions as well as for potential application for the bioconversion of plant biomass to biofuels and other value-added products.","Alternative energy resources","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Energy"
"The overall objective for the proposed research program is to elucidate the complex interactions of biofilms with their environment and the effect of these interactions on catabolic plasmid transfer, maintenance, dissemination and consequent contaminant biodegradation. To initially focus the project scope, subsurface-derived biofilms will be investigated. The knowledge generated by the proposed research will be crucial not only for the assessment of the success of natural attenuation and biodegradation in the subsurface but can be applied to other environments, such as benthic communities, drinking water biofilms, intestinal biofilms or biofilm reactors. The exchange of genetic information between cells is a common phenomenon in both natural and engineered environments and may significantly contribute to accelerated adjustment of microbial communities. Biofilms, accumulations of microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances, represent environmental niches characterized by high cell densities and thus provide ideal environments for gene transfer to occur. Catabolic genes or those coding for antibiotic or metal resistance are often carried on plasmids. Plasmid transfer via conjugation (the exchange of genetic information from one cell to another mediated by cell to cell contact) can be viewed as a bioaugmentation strategy and has been shown to contribute to the spread of catabolic genes in various ecosystems. Despite the fact that plasmid transfer is known to play a critical role in biofilms, little is known about the exact way in which the surrounding environment influences conjugation frequencies and fate of plasmids in biofilms. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that subsurface biofilms facilitate plasmid transfer and consequently contribute to an increased biodegradation potential in aquifers by conducting a very careful set of experiments in continuous flow-through chambers and lab scale microcosms simulating ""real world"" conditions using well characterized catabolic plasmids. The findings from the proposed work will span a bridge to clinical and public health microbiology (spread of antibiotic resistance plasmids in biofilms) and bioremediation strategies.",Environment,"Cell Biology"
"Economic equilibrium is an implicit assumption underlying free market economies: there exist prices, interest rates, etc. (macroeconomic variables) such that if every individual and corporation acts in their own best interest, then resources are allocated and goods are produced efficiently. In this project mathematical models of economies in a random environment are developed. The individuals have multiple decisions to make: how much to work, to consume, to save, to invest. The aim is to show that even in such complex settings economic equilibrium exists.



Another problem to be investigated concerns portfolio optimization. How should a portfolio of assets be chosen if the personal preferences depend on a random regime, e.g. in a bull market we may want to maximize wealth, but in a bear market we are concerned with preserving wealth?

"Thiosalts are sulphur oxides produced in the processing of sulphide ores. During the milling, grinding, and floatation of the ore or in the hydrometallurgical processing of the mineral to recover metals, partial oxidation occurs forming thiosalts. Thiosalts can pass through traditional effluent treatment systems relatively unaffected and oxidize to sulphuric acid in receiving ponds or other water bodies. Studies indicate that thiosalts themselves are not toxic but, rather, the pH depression in the water bodies is their negative impact on the environment. It is, therefore, important to accurately determine the behaviour of thiosalts in the receiving water body. 

The short term objectives of this proposal are to determine thiosalt behaviour in an aqueous environment independent of other factors that may be present in the mining/metals processing treatment ponds and develop accurate methods to measure thiosalts. 

The long term objective is the development of an overall thiosalt management plan where the location, wastewater composition, and available treatment options would be integrated into a risk assessment approach to decrease the overall impact of the mining/metals processing operations.

Although not currently regulated, thiosalts represent a significant challenge to both the mining and metals processing. The ability to predict behaviour in the ponds will have a significant impact on both costs and the environmental impact on discharge. This research will allow for better predictions of thiosalts and begin the incorporation of risk assessment into their management. This, as previously mentioned, will result in lower management costs, more directed treatment systems, and mitigate environmental impacts of pH depression.

"The research will combine  laboratory based measurements and observations using 'night vision' (image intensifiers) and charge coupled device (CCD) digital cameras to study how meteors ablate and produce light in the Earth's atmosphere.  The laboratory based research will employ a pulsed laser to vaporize small regions of meteorites.  The short duration light produced following ablation will be studied using synchronized digital cameras, digital spectroscopes and photometers. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) will be used to precisely measure the mass of meteorite material vaporized.  By relating this mass to the light and laser energies, we will obtain an estimate of the luminous efficiency factor.  The luminous efficiency factor is the ratio of the light produced to the  kinetic energy of impinging atmospheric molecules. Since most meteoroid masses are estimated by integrating the light produced by the meteor and assuming a value for the luminous efficiency value, mass flux estimates, and the associated space risk, depends critically on this value.  We will use energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to measure the abundance of elements before and after laser ablation.  We will determine if meteors ablate in a chemically differential manner, that is do more volatile elements such as sodium or carbon ablate first. Meteoroids from comets are believed to have been little altered since the formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago.  Most meteoroids are dustballs, collections of thousands of individual dust grains held together by a more volatile 'glue'.  Our differential ablation work will test the premise that carbon may be this 'glue'.  We will use telescopic optics with the CCD cameras and spectrometers to search for evidence of dustball fragmentation.  We will continue to explore this question of contamination of cometary nuclei by deep impact of high velocity meteoroids.  We will use dual telescopes and CCD detectors and spectrometers in order to search for meteoroid impacts on the moon, and develop models for the risk of secondary ejecta to space operations on the surface of the moon.

"Lack of available nitrogen (N) limits plant growth in most Canadian forests.  Many woody plants are well adapted to tolerate low-N soils having slow growth rates, long-lived tissues, low nutrient concentrations and low rates of nutrient loss. In addition, most woody plant roots are associated with mycorrhizal fungi which assist in nutrient acquisition.  Many forest plants can take up N in organic and inorganic forms which raises the possibility of niche partitioning where species are adapted to take up and use particular N forms.  My lab seeks to understand the physiological mechanisms of adaptation and acclimation to N form and availability.  With this information we can  evaluate root competitive strength and response in forest plants which, in turn,  influence species diversity, primary productivity and community stability.

     Proposed studies will use woody species predicted to differ in their N-form preference; and explore the species' nutritional characteristics in the simplified environments of solution culture and artificial media, as well as in complex native forest soils.  Uptake of ammonium, nitrate and amino acids will be measured in roots of different ages with and without mycorrhizal association.  The effects of root zone pH and temperature on rates of N uptake will be quantified.  Species' competitiveness for different forms of N will be assessed in inter- and intra-specific plantings.  

     Fluxes of ammonium, nitrate and protons will be measured at the root cell level with ion-specific microelectrodes.  Uptake of inorganic N and amino acids by whole root systems will be measured from solution, and in artificial media and soil by applying stable isotopes.  The combination of tools to assess N uptake at several levels allows us to answer a number of important questions, including: ""How do roots of different ages contribute to nutrient uptake in woody root systems?  Do forest plant species have different N-form preferences and do they compete for different forms of N? Do mycorrhizae affect N-form preference and N competition in forest plants?""

"My lab is interesting in identifying and understanding the function of genes required for a specialized type of cell division called asymmetric cell division.  Asymmetric cell division is defined simply as the process by which a mother cell divides to produce two daughter cells that become different (i.e. a skin cell and a gut cell). This process is essential in all multicellular organisms, including humans, to generate different cell types. However, we study this problem in a very simple model system, the small soil worm C. elegans.  We use C. elegans because it is comprised of only 959 cells and because scientists have watched every cell division from the fertilized egg to the adult we know where every cell comes from.  From this analysis, we know that there are exactly 302 nerve cells in the worm and they all arise from asymmetric cell divisions.  My lab has identified two very exciting genes that control asymmetric cell divisions necessary to produce neurons.  One of these genes is part of a pathway that allows cells to communicate with each other and this gene is part of a pathway that is also found in humans.  In humans disruption of this pathway is contributes to many diseases including cancer.  My lab is taking advantage of all the genetic and molecular experiments that can be done in the worm to identify new and novel genes that participate in this pathway.  We also study a protein that is specifically localized to one side of a cell before division, and as a result, after division only becomes inherited by one of the two daughter cells.  We are performing further experiments to determine how inheritance of this protein can make two daughter cells develop differently.  Addressing this question has implications for every organism that is comprised of more than one cell type.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Molec. & Develop. Genetics"
"An electron has charge and spin. Exploiting the electron's charge in semiconductor devices led to the 20th century information revolution. This program aims at contributing toward global efforts in exploiting electron spin at the nanoscale.  Electron spin is a quantum object and has potential use in devices operating according to quantum, instead of classical, mechanics. These quantum devices require localising, controlling and manipulating electron spins at the nanoscale. This can be accomplished using nanoscale semiconductor structures, semiconductor quantum dots. Two main avenues will be pursued. In the first approach the theory of lateral quantum dots (field effect transistors so small that each transistor contains just one electron spin) will be developed. Such theory will allow the exploration of these artificial molecules with a single spin each as small quantum processors, precursors of solid state computers. Once such processors are constructed and information is processed, it will need to be stored. This requires development of nanoscale memory elements embedded in a semiconductor. The smallest memory element we can imagine is a single magnetic ion. In the second part of the project we will focus on developing a theory of semiconductor nanostructures containing a controlled number of magnetic ions. The development of control over individual spins at the nanoscale, nano-spintronics, may potentially lead to low power devices, to quantum information devices, and to memory devices based on magnetic moments of individual magnetic ions.","Physical sciences","Condensed Matter Physics"
"Cichlid fishes in the East African Rift Valley lakes provide an excellent natural laboratory for the study of sexual selection. Lake Malawi has more than 1,000 endemic species with a striking diversity in trophic adaptations and behaviours. What makes this example of adaptive radiation so exciting is that it evolved in a notably short time. Critical behavioural decisions such as choosing a mate profoundly affect an individual's fitness. Sexual selection can depend heavily on visual cues that must be rapidly translated into appropriate behavioural actions that eventually maximize fitness. Female cichlids are able to visually discriminate between males of their own species and closely related species, using body color and possibly other visual cues. Mate choice based on intraspecific color signaling plays a critical role in maintaining biodiversity when species are sympatric and not ecologically differentiated. Furthermore, successful mate choice in these cichlids necessitates acute visual discrimination in a temporally and spatially dynamic light environment. The role of color in cichlids is thus considered central to cichlid diversification in the great lakes of Africa, yet our understanding of the basis for body color and polarization patterns and the functional characteristics of cichlid visual systems remain quite limited.

    Central to the success of all research programs is the recruitment of highly qualified personnel with a suite of skills and talent to tackle cutting-edge research questions. There are several promising young scholars that have expressed a keen interest in working on this research question. My laboratory has the depth of experience in visual neurobiology and behaviour and unique infrastructure to explore the topic of how vision guides mate choice in African cichlids. This is a behaviour that maintains biodiversity in some of the world's most diverse ecosystems. Our research will investigate visual sensitivity, the physical characteristics of and regulatory mechanisms for optical signals in cichlids, and how female cichlids use visual information to choose mates.

"In the past 5 years a new technique, resonant soft x-ray scattering, has emerged as a powerful new tool to study electronic ordering in materials like the high temperature superconductors or the colossal magneto resistance manganite materials.  My proposal is to develop and make use of this technique at the Canadian Light Source, the new 3rd generation synchrotron in Saskatoon.



The power of this technique is to combine x-ray scattering, which probes spatial order, with x-ray spectroscopy, which probes electronic structure and is sensitive to different atomic species, as well as different valence, magnetic and orbital states within an atomic species.  This combination allows one to probe very directly and considerable detail a variety of exotic magnetic (spin), charge, orbital or structural order phenomena.  



Planned projects will include use of RSXS to investigate: 

-    )	stripe-like charge ordering in high temperature superconductors, in an effort to understand the relationship between this ordering phenomena and superconductivity.  

-    )	ordered states of matter in materials such as the manganites, that occur with complex mixtures of spin, charge, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom.  Here the use of RSXS can be used to distinguish between these different degrees of freedom and their relative influence on the ordering.



In addition to RSXS, I will also develop a research program incorporating other complementary experimental and theoretical techniques, including Fourier transform holography studies of electronic disorder, x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), inverse photoemission spectroscopy and calculations of electronic structure.

"Objectives: The long-term objective is to predict the dynamic adjustment of the mobile seabed to combined wave-current forcing. The focus of this proposal is the role of bottom stress, and non-linear wave-wave and wave-current interactions, in the adjustment process. Primary objectives are improved knowledge and understanding of: (1) the relationships between wave energy, near-bed fluid turbulence, bottom stress and bed state occurrence; (2) the vertical sediment flux balance and sediment entrainment; (3) the role of higher-order velocity moments in the horizontal sediment flux; and (4) bedform genesis, growth, migration and decay. 

     Approach: Acoustic and optical remote sensing technologies are used to obtain comprehensive seabed imagery and velocity, turbulence and suspended sediment concentration profiles spanning the bottom boundary layer. New initiatives include: a newly-developed multi-frequency acoustic Doppler system for remotely measuring velocity, turbulence and sediment flux profiles within the thin wave bottom boundary layer; a laboratory facility for oscillatory-flow boundary layer studies above both fixed-grain and mobile sediment beds; and the use of these sensors in deep-ocean observing systems.    

     Significance: The adjustment of mobile seabed sediments to fluid forcing variability is one of the important challenges in modern ocean science. The importance resides in the applied science and societal needs for more accurate predictions of seabed change, in the effects of seabed adjustment on the predictability of ocean dynamics, and in the potential for improved interpretation of paleo-environmental conditions through the sedimentary record. The challenge resides in the observational difficulties, in the responses of the mobile sediments and the fluid motions being both mutual and non-linear, and in the fundamental connections to fluid turbulence, one of the great unsolved problems in modern physics. Particular to the coastal and shelf regions of the ocean, relative to other mobile bed environments (rivers, deserts, snow fields), is the central role of forcing by surface gravity waves.

"New Polymeric Structures Synthesized by N-C Coupling Reactions via Nucleophilic Polycondensation Reactions

  Poly(aryl ether)s are commercially important high performance polymers that are synthesized principally by reaction of bisphenols with activated dihalocompounds in solvents  at elevated temperatures in the presence of bases. The reactions proceed via a nucleophilic condensation reaction.

   Several years ago we found that high molecular weight polymers could be prepared from

4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)phthalazin-1(2H)-one by reaction with activated halides. The phthalazinone molecule contains an OH as well as an NH group. The N-C coupling reaction was unexpected and indicated that the NH group behaves like a phenolic OH group in this reaction. The resulting polymers are high performance engineering thermoplastics (Tgs up to 310°C) that are currently under commercial development.

   We recently found that the potentially very inexpensive bisbenzimidazoles can also form high molecular weight linear polymers by reaction with activated dihalides under conditions similar to those required for poly(aryl ether) formation except for higher reaction temperatures. Preliminary studies indicate that copolymers with biphenols are of particular interest since they give high Tg, moldable materials in which the Tg can be modified (ca 220-290 �C) by changing the copolymer ratio.The polymers are highly fluorescent.

   Poly[arylene ether(N-arylenebenzimidazole)]s  have been extensively studied at NASA.These high performance polymers have excellent properties, however, the synthesis utilized is very arduous and the resulting polymers, therefore, would be extremely expensive and they have not been pursued further.

   We have also recently demonstrated a polymerization of the 9H,9'H-3,3'-bicarbazole 5 and copolymerization with activated halides under similar conditions.(10) These are high Tg film-forming materials that are also highly fluorescent in the blue region.

   We expect that other monomers can be developed incorporating less basic NH groups, e.g., bisacridones, bisamines and bisamides. We propose an extensive study on the synthesis of NH-containing monomers for the synthesis and characterization of polymers containing N-C linkages and we will identify specific structures (polymers and copolymers) for further study as materials that may have the potential for commercial development as high performance thermoplastics.

"The long-term goal of this study is to advance our understanding of alpine hydrological processes, develop mathematical algorithms representing these processes, and incorporate the algorithms into large-scale basin models for the prediction of river flow in the warming climate. Most of the rivers in western Canada have their headwaters in the alpine region. The hydrology of alpine headwaters is strongly influenced by the processes involving snow and ice, which in turn are sensitive to the climate warming. An increase in air temperature is expected to result in more rain and less snow, earlier snowmelt and later freeze-up, and the retreat of alpine glaciers. While the wastage of glaciers and the shift in the timing of snowmelt and freeze-up are well documented, their effects on river flow regime are not well understood. This is largely due to the lack of field-based hydrological process studies focusing on storage mechanisms and flow pathways in the alpine headwaters. Without a sound understanding of the hydrological processes, it is difficult to build reliable hydrological models of mountain river basins. Literature review and preliminary studies in the Canadian Rockies have identified critical knowledge gaps in groundwater processes and surface-groundwater interaction. Therefore, the short-term objectives within the next five years will include: 1) characterization of the storage and routing of glacier melt, snowmelt, and rain water in streams, lakes, and groundwater aquifers, 2) development of small-scale (1-10 km2) models of surface and subsurface processes, and 3) linking the small-scale models to large-scale river basin models.",Water,"Environmental Earth Sciences"

"Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are techniques that enable scientists, engineers, and doctors to study diverse problems, ranging from subtle atomic, molecular, and chemical processes to the structure and function of the human body. Ordinarily, they require the use of powerful magnets that polarize the sample or subject. This amounts to aligning the nuclei of atoms in the sample; as a rule of thumb, the larger the magnetic field is, the better the signal or image will be. 

     The research described in this proposal seeks to explore the other extreme: NMR and MRI in very-weak magnetic fields. While this might seem counter-productive, methods do exist for polarizing certain atoms without resorting to a large magnetic field.  For example, I use lasers to polarize the nuclei of certain members of the noble gas family of elements, such as helium. Once polarized, I am able to image this gas using a low-field MRI system that was developed in my laboratory - one of only a handful of such devices worldwide. If this gas is inhaled, an image of the lungs can be generated. We have already shown that there are good reasons for pursuing this technology, but it is not yet ready for commercialization or clinical use. 

     The research that we will undertake to perform falls into two categories that are intimately related, yet have radically different motivations and outcomes. In the first category, we will investigate new ways of manipulating atoms and detecting signals as images or other forms of NMR data are acquired. This will help us to understand, quantify, and optimize the information that we extract from low-field - and in some cases high field - NMR/MRI experiments; in effect, to realize practical applications.  In the second category, we will collaborate with other physicists to perform a very complex magnetic resonance experiment in which the sample is a gaseous mixture of polarized neutrons (a subatomic particle) and polarized helium atoms at temperatures close to absolute zero. This experiment will probe the structure of the neutron with exquisite sensitivity, and is expected to challenge theories that describe the nature of matter.

"Quantum information theory lies squarely in the intersection of computer science, mathematics and theoretical physics. The field has advanced at a tremendous rate over the past ten years, motivated by the development of cryptographic techniques based on quantum mechanics and Shor's celebrated factoring algorithm. This research project will push the boundaries of the field on three fronts. First, the many suprising simplifications and equivalences of the asymptotic theory will be rigorously developed. This area provides the conceptual scaffolding for our understanding of the nature of information in a quantum mechanical world. Simultaneously, the project will pursue the development of the tools needed to take the ideas from the asymptotic theory and make them useful in future quantum computers, specifically polynomial time quantum algorithms for the computations required in the protocols. These efforts, in addition to helping to sharpen our understanding of the basic information resources known as bits, qubits and ebits, will lead to new cryptographic protocols with security based on the laws of physics. The third front in the project will consist of bringing to bear the analytical tools of quantum information theory on problems in physics such as fate of information falling into a black hole and, more prosaically, the design of optimal measurement strategies in mesoscopic detectors.","Advancement of knowledge","Computing and Information Sciences - B"

"Research in the Hayes group focuses on the preparation and study of high-energy and reactive molecules for application in new chemical transformations and catalysis. Specifically, we are interested in the development of catalytic systems for directly converting inexpensive and abundant hydrocarbons into useful organic compounds. Such derivitization is especially desirable for smaller hydrocarbons, such as methane, which are produced as undesirable side products in the petrochemical industry and contribute significantly to greenhouse gases. We use molecules known as phosphido ligands to stabilize high oxidation state late transition metal complexes with unusual geometries and unique electronic properties to promote the activation of chemically inert small molecules. The isolation of this class of compound should also provide insight into fundamental questions regarding bonding and structure  and contribute to the knowledge base used by chemists to design new catalytic reactions.  This additional knowledge will ultimately allow for rational improvements to current catalytic systems and the development of entirely novel reactions.



The second component of my research program tackles the challenge of preparing new materials that are both biodegradable and biocompatible. A particularly attractive alternative to conventional polyolefin materials is polylactide, PLA, which exhibits useful processability and macroscopic properties. In addition, the synthetic precursors to PLA can be found in inexpensive renewable resources, such as beets and corn, and the resultant polymers are both environmentally friendly and biologically compatible. Despite these benefits, current technologies have limited activity and offer very little control over key features of the polymer. Unlike these systems, which are neutral, our strategy focuses upon the development of positively charged magnesium and calcium, alkoxide and amido species, which, due to increased electrophilicity and coordinative unsaturation, should be highly active lactide polymerization catalysts.

"Haptic technology aims at the artificial creation of the sensation of touching objects. By way of analogy, computer graphics aims at artificially creating the sensation of seeing objects. For example in the medical field, there are numerous instances where haptic technologies can contribute greatly. It can be used to teach and train, or to perform medicine remotely, and be applied to rehabilitation and therapy.  In manufacturing, haptic technologies are now applied to enable the assessment of products before physical mockups are made. One application which we will be pursuing is develop technology that will enable the blind and visually impaired access graphical information.



The research to be carried out is aimed at the development of techniques that make it possible to build systems that can create haptic simulations having a great deal of realism. We will aim at expanding the techniques of haptic synthesis to create haptic signals that result from the dynamics of solid interaction (viscosity, plasticity, creep) since, to date, our techniques apply to quasi-static cases only. Another aim of the research will be the development of techniques that can provide cutaneous sensations which are similar to those arising when scanning surfaces, a specific example being reading Braille characters.



In parallel, we will seek progress toward the development of a computational theory of haptic perception. We will consider the information that is available to recover the properties of the touched object and deduce the problems that must be solved by the brain to recover the relevant information. It will then be possible to pose the corresponding computational problems. From this,  predictions will be made and behavioral experiments will be designed to test them by systematic manipulation of the cues that participate in the solution of the original problem.

"Complexins constitute a family of cytosolic proteins that are involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. Complexin I is considered a marker of inhibitory synapses, while complexin II (Cpx II) labels predominantly excitatory nerve terminals. Although it is clear that neurotransmitter release occurs at the presynaptic terminal, recent evidence suggest that astrocytes possess the same neuronal machinery used for synaptic vesiclar release. Since Cpx II is an integral part of this neuronal machinery, we plan to study its role in the release of glutamate from these glial cells. The research project will address hypotheses that consider 1) Cpx II is present in astrocytes and regulates the release of glutamate from these cells, 2) Cpx II II modulates synaptic neurotransmission, 3) Oxidative stress influences Cpx II-mediated glutamate release, and 4) Cpx II regulates a novel and distinct form of astrocytic glutamate release that is different to other types of glutamate release operating under conditions of pathology. These issues will be addressed using primary cultures of astrocytes and neurons, in which knockdown of Cpx II gene expression will be produced and consequential genomic effects of altered Cpx II function will be identified in astrocytes and neurons along with energy metabolism changes. We are confident this research project will not only increase our understanding of the role of complexins in astrocyte function, but will also provide new insight into the significance of glutamate release from these cells, the influence of this process on excitatory neurotransmission, and its vulnerability under pathological conditions.

"My research is primarily concerned with developing solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SSNMR) methods to study the structure of, and molecular motion in, materials that contain fluorine. The ultimate objective is to establish the University of Lethbridge as a center for characterization of a wide range of fluorine containing materials.  The repertoire of structural and dynamic experiments, as well as simulations tools, will be continually expanded to meet new challenges posed by emerging fluorine technologies. Materials of interest include organic and inorganic fluoropolymers, highly reactive inorganic fluorides, inclusion compounds, biological macromolecules, and pharmaceuticals, where most sample materials will be sourced through a network of local and international collaborators. Collaborations will be continually sought with industrial and academic researchers to provide them with valuable characterization capabilities and expertise thereby aiding innovation in the development of new technologies.

Fluoropolymers of particular commercial interest are used in membranes of Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC), which are essential in the development of Direct Alcohol Fuel Cells.  Ethanol is proposed as an alternative energy vector to hydrogen, suggesting an 'Ethanol Economy'.  Ethanol is much easier to obtain from biological sources, however posses a challenge from a catalysis perspective. Success would bring considerable benefit from ease of integration into the currently globally-expanding bio-ethanol production, raising the prospect of a sustainable, non-fossil fuel energy economy. 

The development of a methodology to assess which polymer properties, at the molecular level, are crucial to the efficient operation as PEMFC membrane is the ultimate objective.  Insights will also be sought into the role of the fuel in affecting changes, over the long term, in the polymer's physical characteristics, and hence efficiency.  This program involves collaborations with a synthetic polymer chemist in Montpellier, France, and two material scientists at University of St. Andrews, Scotland.

"The surface of cells and proteins is decorated with a large variety of complex carbohydrate molecules. These carbohydrates play important roles in cell-cell recognition events, immunity, tumors, and development. Fucosyltransferases are enzymes that add fucose sugar molecules to carbohydrates that form the human ""Lewis"" blood group antigens. The bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori has been found to make the same Lewis antigens, which may help it to hide from the immune system. The bacterial and human fucosyltransferase enzymes share many properties but seem to be only very distantly related by evolution. A better understanding of the properties and molecular mechanisms of enzyme function for the bacterial enzymes will also increase our knowledge of the mammalian enzymes. Moreover, the bacterial enzymes can be produced at lower cost and may be suitable as reagents to produce blood group antigens for medical purposes.

"Item nonresponse occurs in most, if not all surveys. Nonresponse is an important problem in surveys because response rates have been decreasing over time.  In most cases, item nonresponse is treated by using some form of imputation. Another difficulty that occurs frequently in surveys (especially in business surveys) is the presence of outliers. Nonresponse generally leads to biased estimators if the respondents and nonrespondents have different characteristics with respect to the variables measured by the survey, whereas outliers potentially lead to very unstable estimators. It becomes necessary to develop techniques that reduce the nonresponse bias in the context of nonresponse and the variance in the context of outliers. Among the possible applications, the developed techniques play a central role in evaluating existing theories and they allow the survey statisticians to provide better estimators.



This project will study several aspects of inference in the presence of imputed data and outliers. First, we study the use of the conditional bias of a unit as a systematic way to derive robust estimators in the presence of outliers. Also, the properties of calibrated robust imputation methods will be established. We will propose a new class of imputation methods, called balanced random imputation methods which will lead to efficient estimators because the imputation variance will be reduced, while the distribution of the variables being imputed will be preserved. Other themes of the proposal are the inference in multi-stage sampling and the estimation of relationships in the presence of imputed data.

"Macroecology is a newly emerging ecological discipline aiming to search for a parsimonious set of general patterns with respect to species coexistence and biodiversity distribution and to understand the rules that underlie those patterns observed in nature. This subject has never been so exciting as it is now. The recent progress on several fronts of macroecology has greatly stimulated the debate and has substantially advanced the area. This progress includes the development of the neutral theory of biodiversity, the renewed interest in connecting community ecology to functional traits, the search for phylogenetic (evolutionary) footprints in species assemblages, and application of statistical mechanics to modeling biodiversity patterns. Based on these advances, I propose to develop and test models to explain and predict global biodiversity patterns from tropical, temperate to boreal forests. The proposed work will contribute to (1) relaxing the neutral theory by incorporating differential birth and death rates among species so that to make the neutral theory more realistic, (2) understanding the significance of phylogenetic (evolutionary) footprints in promoting biodiversity through developing phylogenetically-based biodiversity indices and genus-species models, and (3) integrating community ecology, autoecology and physiology for understanding the importance of tradeoff in functional traits to biodiversity maintenance. Theories and models developed from this study should enhance our ability to explain and predict macrecological patterns and thus build our capacity of conserving and managing biodiversity in landscapes.

"Performance analysis and optimal design of stochastic systems whose state space has a large number of states can be challenging problems. This is known as the ""curse of dimensionality"" problem common to queueing models, inventory models, and supply chains. The main issue at stake is computational efficiency. A number of approaches such as the state space reduction, approximation, and decomposition have been introduced to solve the problems.  However, there is no universally effective method. Thus, there is a need to look for new solution methods. Following the state space reduction approach, we propose to study PH-representations of phase-type (PH) distributions and to develop efficient algorithms for computing minimal, simple, or specially structured PH-representations for PH-distributions. 

    PH-distributions were introduced by Marcel Neuts in 1975.  Since then, PH-distributions have been used in various branches of science and engineering, including operations research, management science, telecommunications, risk and insurance analysis, and biostatistics.  In particular, PH-distributions are used in our studies of queueing models, inventory models, and supply chains.  A fundamental problem of PH-distributions is to find a PH-representation with the minimum number of states for a PH-distribution.  If minimal PH-representations are available, the state space of stochastic systems with a given structure can be kept as small as possible.  Thus, finding minimal PH-representations has far-reaching impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of the performance analysis of stochastic systems.  Closely related to the minimal representation problem are problems of finding simple or specially structured PH-representations for PH-distributions.  Likewise, if simple or specially structured PH-representations are available, performance analysis of stochastic systems can be done more efficiently. The results of the proposed research have applications in solving the positive realization problem in control theory and in parameter estimation and fitting of PH-distributions as well.

"Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology has been penetrating life science, medicine, information and communication, transportation, environmental monitoring and consumer electronics applications. Micro actuators are important building blocks of MEMS devices. Conventional micro actuators cannot well satisfy the requirements of many MEMS applications due to their limited stroke and low reliability.

      This program is to develop novel micro actuators with the performance far exceeding that of existing designs, which will not only enhance the performance of many existing MEMS applications, but also open new fields of applications for MEMS technology. Novel micro actuators developed in this program will benefit many industrial applications such as optical and wireless communications, biomedical imaging, drug delivery, lab-on-chip systems, MEMS display technology, micro scanning imaging for environmental and agriculture monitoring and barcode scanning for retail, manufacturing, transportation and logistics. These applications are significant to both improving the quality of life and Canadian high-tech industry. 

      Another outcome of this program is the development of deformable micromirrors for improving the image quality of ophthalmic imaging systems to help early diagnosis and treatment of eye disease such as glaucoma, which is the second most common cause of blindness in Canada and is affecting 300,000 Canadians. The micro robotic arm developed in this program will be a potential tool for manipulation of single cells, which is of importance for the rapidly growing area of genomics and proteomics. 

      MEMS have become an enabling technology in a wide range of fields. Both Canadian academia and industry require access to researchers and engineers trained in the area of MEMS. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this program. Students will be trained and be developing skills in MEMS design and multi-physics simulation, micro fabrication and experimental characterization of MEMS devices over this five-year program.

"The goal of this research is to develop novel and rigorous statistical methods to handle complex models that are required to characterize various disease progression processes. The proposed methodology will lead to valuable new insights into many aspects of medical research and will be of great interest to medical and biostatistical researchers. Specific areas to which I intend to contribute are outlined as follows.



1. MULTIVARIATE SURVIVAL DATA: Characterizing associated survival times is typically challenging. Various multiple level structures of survival require different modeling strategies for association structures. An important problem is to assess various model assumptions so that valid inference procedures may be chosen. Standard survival analysis often assumes that covariates appear as a linear form, but this assumption is not adequate enough for many problems. In this research I plan to continue my efforts to explore those challenging problems and develop innovative analysis methods.

2. MICROARRAY DATA: Microarray technology becomes a popular tool for investigation of biological features of a variety of medical problems, and statistical methods for characterizing specific features of microarray studies are in great demand. I intend to devote my efforts to develop powerful statistical methods to address various challenging problems arising from a variety of microarray experiments.

3. MEASUREMENT ERROR: In medical studies it often happens that some collected data are subject to measurement error. When carrying out statistical inference, it is important to account for the effects of mismeasured covariates; otherwise, erroneous or even misleading results may be produced. I intend to develop valid inference methods to account for covariate measurement error for multivariate survival data as well as microarray data.

"A test-bed is requested to develop Active Safety Systems (ASSs) for Multi-Trailer Articulated Vehicles (MTAVs). Compared with articulated vehicles with a single trailer, MTAVs not only improve fuel economy, but also reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. However, due to MTAVs' large sizes and high centre of gravity, they have poor low-speed maneuverability and low high-speed stability. MTAVs' poor maneuverability and low stability may lead to fatal accidents. To increase the operating safety of MTAVs, development of ASSs is critical. The proposed test-bed is an essential tool for developing ASSs.

      The applicant's on-going research program has been developing an Integrated Control System (ICS), including the subsystems of Active Steering Control (ASC), Differential Braking Control (DBC), and Active Roll Moment Control (ARMC), in order to improve the safety of road vehicles and MTAVs in particular. In the program, the control, mechanical, and other relevant subsystems in a vehicle system are simultaneously optimized. To validate the resultant design and evaluate whether there are significant effects neglected in the analysis, especially those relating to interactions between the control subsystems, the optimized system will be tested and verified using the proposed test-bed. The device consists of four main elements: 1) vehicle and control system modeling software; 2) real-time model generation tool; 3) distributed target processors; and 4) real-time interface tool. The vehicle and control system modeling software will develop the corresponding models. Then, the real-time model generation tool converts these models into the real-time models. Finally, the real-time models will be loaded and distributed over a cluster of target processors for real-time simulations. The application of real-time simulations to the verification of design synthesis of MTAVs with ASSs will reduce expensive field tests, facilitate the examination of subsystem interactions, and resolve critical safety issues prior to in-vehicle testing. This research will lead to a systematic approach that designs and evaluates active safety systems for MTAVs.

"The goal of the project is to develop an integrated design method for Multi-Trailer Articulated Vehicles (MTAVs) with Active Trailer Steering (ATS) systems. MTAVs have poor maneuverability when traveling at low speeds on local roads and city streets. On the other hand, MTAVs exhibit unstable motion modes at high speeds, including roll-over. These unstable modes may lead to fatal accidents. To address the problem of poor maneuverability, 'passive' trailer steering systems have been developed. These systems improve low-speed performance, but exhibit low stability at high speeds. Some active trailer steering systems have been proposed to improve high-speed stability. However, these ATS systems typically degrade maneuverability when applied at low speeds. To tackle this complex trade-off design problem, a systematic design method is proposed.

      In order to consider the closed-loop dynamic feature of MTAVs' realistic operations, the proposed method incorporates the modeling and simulation of essential vehicle subsystems, including the mechanical assembles, driver, ATS controllers, and typical test maneuvers. With multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO), these strongly coupled subsystems are integrated as a synergistic system and the mechanical vehicle and ATS subsystems are optimized simultaneously. The resulting ATS system will greatly increase safety of MTAVs with two operational control modes, one for improving high-speed stability and the other for enhancing low-speed maneuverability. To validate the resultant design, it will be tested using driver-software-in-the-loop real-time simulations. In collaboration with Genist Systems Inc. (GSI), this method will be applied to the design of a MTAV with ATS systems. The proposed method will be capable of identifying desired design variables and predicting optimal performance envelopes in the early design stages of MTAVs.

      The project will contribute to the advancement of scientific research in the field of MDO for complex mechatronic systems. The project will also contribute to the training of highly qualified personnel in vehicle design. Finally, this project will result in technology transfer with benefits to GSI and the Canadian society.",Engineering,"RPP Internal Decision Cttee"
"This research aims at developing an improved method for the automated design synthesis of mechatronic vehicles with integrated control systems (ICSs), involving differential braking control, active steering control and active roll moment control. The method will be used for automating the design synthesis of vehicles so that the mechanical and control subsystems will be simultaneously optimized. This proposed new approach will build upon the applicant's previous research in design methodologies of mechatronic vehicles. In the existing methodology, an original design problem is decomposed into a two-level optimization. However, this methodology is not suitable for the design synthesis of mechatronic vehicles with ICSs. The reasons for this are twofold:  firstly, the optimization algorithm at the system level has difficulties coordinating a large number of design criteria and constraints, resulting from the decomposition of the original system design into the many subsystem designs at the only subsystem level; secondly, from the perspective of functional design, the integrated control systems are frequently decomposed into multi-level architectures. 

    In order to extend the existing methodology, the proposed research will focus on the following three original investigations: (1) Decomposition of vehicle design targets: the research will derive a systematic design target decomposition approach considering both mechanical and control subsystems. (2) Automated dynamic modeling: multibody dynamics, symbolic formulations and modular modelling techniques will be integrated to generate various models for design evaluations at various levels in the multi-level optimizations. The models will include vehicle-level and sub-level models, which will retain the corresponding mechanical and control properties. (3) Design framework: a novel design framework will be developed for integrating multi-level optimization formulation methods, dynamic modelling techniques and search algorithms.  

    Overall, this research is expected to yield valuable techniques and guidelines for automated design syntheses of complex mechatronic systems consisting of mechanical, control and other related subsystems.

Geometric morphometric and histological analytical techniques are applied to recent and fossil squamate osteology to examine the phylogenetic history of regulatory gene expression in the evolution of squamate body plans, the role of heterochronic disassociation in cranial evolution of squamates, the evolution of body size and feeding ecology in snake origins and the environmental influences on these innovations, and the evolution of derived physiology (including evenomation) in advanced snakes and the relationship of physiological adaptations to climate change during the Neogene diversification of derived taxa.

"The North Atlantic Current is an important conveyor of heat and moisture to the high northern latitudes.  The proposed research aims to reconstruct sea-surface conditions numerically in the North Atlantic for the past 4.9 million years as means of assessing the fluctuating influence of the North Atlantic Current over time.  Such reconstructions are critical for understanding the ocean-climate system and validating computer-generated climate simulations.

     Described as the ""dancing dust of the sea"", dinoflagellates are mostly free-swimming cells and rank among the most important primary producers in today's oceans.  Their organic-walled cysts, ""dinocysts"", are now routinely used in quantitative reconstructions of later Quaternary marine environments, especially at higher latitudes.  The analysis of their fossil record allows us to reconstruct both summer and winter sea-surface temperature and salinity, the duration of sea-ice cover, and even levels of nutrient enrichment.

     The proposed research examines dinocysts at very high temporal resolution across seven time intervals (each about 100 thousand years duration or less) of critical paleoclimatic interest for the Pliocene through Holocene.  Material will be examined from across the North Atlantic region based on existing deep-sea core material.  Assemblages will be calibrated using a novel method that obtains stable isotopes and Mg/Ca ratios to serve as fully independent proxies for climate change, allowing precise tuning to an orbital timescale.  Results will provide new insights into the timing and causes of Northern Hemisphere glaciations, past episides of global warming, and indeed the very mechanisms of climate change.

Personal social networking websites such as MySpace, FaceBook and Friendster have matured from 'kid-connection' sites to a normalized part of society.  Facebook membership more than doubled to 47 million within the first six months of 2007 and the majority of the 110 million MySpace users are over the age of 35.  Similarly, professional social networks such as LinkedIn had grown to 12 million registered users spanning 150 industries as of July 2007.

Existing interfaces will be examined via experimental comparison of various attitudinal antecedents.  Based on these results and building from extant literature on individual differences, a model will be developed that explains the outcomes of existing OSN interface and predicts the usability of new designs.  This model will be the basis for developing an adaptive and adaptable interface that matches the unique preferences of user groups (as appropriately determined by age, gender and culture) across personal or professional objectives. Further usability studies will be conducted to evaluate and refine the proposed model and interface.  The novel expected contributions of this research will be: (i) the development of a new theoretical model that will help explain users' preferences for existing OSN interfaces (for diverse user groups across personal and professional contexts) and predict the appropriateness and usability of new designs; (ii) the design and evaluation of an adaptive and adaptable OSN interface that reflects the diverse preferences of various user groups across personal and professional contexts; and (iii) the provision of explicit design guidelines for OSN interfaces.

"Life on Earth has evolved spectacular diversity, with millions of living species. Some lineages, though, have diversified much more than others - among birds, for instance, the perching birds are far more diverse than the penguins, despite being of similar age.  I seek to understand connections between contemporary ecology and the historical origins of biodiversity.  I take a two-pronged approach to understanding these connections.  First, I ask how ecology has controlled the origin of new species, working with the community of insect herbivores attacking two species of goldenrod.  Second, I ask how biodiversity is packaged into regional faunas and local communities, using data from the reconstructed evolutionary histories of living organisms.  

    The centrepiece of my work is a search for factors controlling dietary specialization and the origin of new species among herbivorous insects.  Some insects (e.g., the meadow spittlebug) are generalists, feeding on many plant species.  Others (e.g., the monarch butterfly) are tight specialists feeding on just one or two plants.  Such specialists often evolve complexes of closely related species, each feeding on a different plant host.  However, we know little about why a particular insect might have evolved one feeding strategy or the other.

    My past work has shown the evolution of specialist complexes to be remarkably common in insects.  Next, I will explore the influence of plant variability (in morphology and chemistry) on the evolution of specialization in goldenrod herbivores.  When an insect attacks two plant species, whether it evolves a pair of host-specific specialists or remains a generalist may depend on its response to plant variation within each species.  

    Understanding insect specialization will be a crucial piece of the puzzle, if we are to understand the reasons for the astonishing diversity of the insects (at least a million species on Earth today).  Furthermore, the ability to predict insect diets - and especially, when those diets will expand to include plant species previously unattacked - is extremely important to Canada's agricultural and forestry sectors, where unanticipated insect attack leads to enormous economic losses.

"During the next five years, my research group at UBC will continue to investigate how faults work below the brittle upper crust.  Our main goal is to explain how fault zones connect the steady relative moton of tectonic plates to episodic earthquakes along faults in the brittle upper crust. If we can understand this, we can estimate forces along faults, and calculate the probability of damaging earthquakes.



To do our research, we develop numerical computer models that represent major fault systems, and the lithosphere in which they are embedded.  We test whether we can make a model accurate enough to reproduce data from the Earth - for example, ultra-precise GPS measurements of motion of the Earth's surface around faults.  Some models assume that a plane of 'gooey' material connects the fault to the mantle and the tectonic plates slide past each other along this surface.  Other models hypothesize that everything below the brittle upper crust (within hundreds of kilometers of an active fault) can flow, so the tectonic plate is actually just the brittle upper crust.  There are many other ideas to test as well.



My group develops models of deformation around the San Andreas fault, the Cascadia Subduction Zone, and the fault in Turkey that produced the deadly 1999 Izmit earthquake.  For each of these faults, we develop a master model which represents our best possible hypothesis about how it works. Understanding how faults work is fundamentally important for fully explaining plate tectonics, but it is also a prerequisite for calculating absolute crustal stresses and how these stresses vary with time.  Both are required for doing accurate physics-based seismic hazard assessments.

The requested equipment will provide high through-put DNA/RNA extraction capabilities for large-scale parentage analysis, gene flow and migration estimation, invasive species identification, population divergence analysis, hybridization identification, and gene transcription analyses targeting the effects of environmental change on homeostasis.

However, the extraction of such target molecules from tissue or blood samples is typically labour-intensive.  Automation of the process will allow the applicants to increase sample size and thus resolution in their ecological and environmental studies.

"Canadian aquatic environments are increasingly stressed as a result of contaminant loads from industry, agriculture and urbanization. Chemicals eventually end up in aquatic environments where biological availability is high. The high level of stress in contaminated aquatic habitats will elicit an adaptive response in the resident fauna: either short-term physiological change (acclimation), genetic change driven by selection (evolution), or both. Such adaptive responses are not considered when we look for population- or ecosystem-level effects of contaminant exposure and may explain the rarity of negative population-level effects. This project examines the response of brown bullhead from contaminated and clean sites to contaminant (PAH) challenges. We propose that the energetic and survival costs of living in contaminated environments drive physiological and genetic changes that maximize the survival of the stressed fish; however, acclimation has high energetic costs and is thus a short-term solution, while evolutionary responses are longer-term solutions that drive other life history changes. Using novel methodologies developed for quantifying contaminant response across levels of biological organization (molecular, cellular, physiological, behavioural, and population) in this model catfish species, we will partition the toxicological stress response into physiological and genetic adaptive components. The goal of the project is to quantify and integrate stress response measures, and generalize our results by estimating the energetic costs of adaptive contaminant responses to explicitly incorporate such costs into a bioenergetic model.

We will use integrated interdisciplinary approaches to evaluating population-level effects of contaminated environments to provide regulatory recommendations for contaminated aquatic ecosystems: for example, ecosystems exhibiting primarily acclimation are likely not stable, and immediate intervention would be indicated, while ecosystems exhibiting adaptive genetic change are more stable, and longer term action plans would be appropriate.

"Salmon are often thought to be locally adapted due to their natal homing and remarkable life history variation; yet little empirical evidence exists to support this. Additive genetic variance is an important component of adaptation, yet environment, epigenetics, non-additive genetics, and phenotypic plasticity also have roles in rapid evolution and local adaptation. I propose to use molecular, population, and quantitative genetic methods combined with field measurements to quantify the various genetic, epigenetic and environmental effects on maturation and migration life history traits in Pacific salmon. Pacific salmon are ideal model organisms for my research as they exhibit extreme life history variation and experience strong selection (since they die after spawning); my proposed research will capitalize on my experience in salmon genetics, ecology and physiology to assess rapid evolution and local adaptation in Pacific salmon.

     A key prerequisite for local adaptation is reproductive isolation, thus I will measure both genetic and life history divergence among populations: The comparison of the two will determine whether trait differences are due to drift or are adaptive. This will provide compelling evidence for local adaptation, but it is essentially correlative. Thus I will also use breeding experiments, molecular marker-based quantitative genetics (QTLs), and reaction norm analyses to estimate additive and non-additive genetic effects, gene number, and phenotypic plasticity for reproductive and migratory traits. In a parallel research program, I will quantify gene transcription variation among populations. I believe that epigenetic and non-additive genetic effects on transcription may provide a unified mechanistic explanation for rapid evolution and phenotypic plasticity. Such a novel finding would represent a revolutionary conceptual advance in our understanding of local adaptation.

     The integration of genetic and transcriptional analyses with field measures will test the link between life history variation and local adaptation, addressing a question central to our understanding of the evolution of life history variation in salmon: are salmon runs locally adapted or are they simply highly plastic?","Conservation and preservation","Evolution & Ecology"

Moreover, these resources continually seek out new and optimal ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our movements.  Hence, the projects associated with this grant seek to understand the sensory, cognitive and motor mechanisms that contribute to our ability to regulate skilled actions.  For example, what information from our visual world is used to control reaching and grasping movements, and what regions of the brain process this information?  Do anatomical properties of the human eye impact the production of fast and accurate movements to different regions of visual space?  How does our sense of body position contribute to the successful planning and control of skilled movement?

"Canadian researchers, joined by colleagues in 25 nations, are working to activate the International Barcode of Life Project (iBOL) which will employ DNA barcodes as a tool for the identification of known species and the discovery of new ones. The overall task of iBOL lies in collecting and curating specimens, gathering barcode records from them and building the informatics platform needed to store these records and to enable their use in species identification. In addition, iBOL participants will apply DNA barcoding to real world problems, such as forensics, conservation, marketplace regulation and ecosystem monitoring. Within 5 years, iBOL researchers will gather DNA barcode records from 5M specimens, representing at least 500K species, producing a highly effective identification system for those species that are regularly encountered by humanity.



Although iBOL's work will involve a broad research alliance, Canada will have a leadership role. Research involvements will span the nation, but the Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding (CCDB) at the University of Guelph will be iBOL's scientific hub, operating its high-volume sequencing facility, maintaining its central informatics platform and hosting its largest scientific team. With a staff of 100 genomicists, informaticians, and taxonomists, the CCDB will provide leadership to the iBOL community. In particular, the CCDB-LAB will represent the largest barcode analytical facility in iBOL, while its informatics team will sustain  development of BOLD, the Barcode of Life Data System, which is the primary repository and analytical vehicle for barcode data. The present application requests funding for key supervisory positions linked to the oversight of BOLD and the LAB. It also requests support to ensure that sequencing infrastructure is well maintained and to enable the continuation of a highly successful scientific exchange program at the CCDB.

"Over the past 250 years, more than 1.7 million species of eukaryotes have been described. Despite this substantial effort, the task of species recognition remains complex. Many species (perhaps 90%) remain undescribed and formal descriptions do not ensure subsequent recognition because the morphological nuances that separate closely allied species ordinarily require a specialist for interpretation. The barcode of life initiative aims to revolutionize both the discovery and identification of life by exploiting sequence diversity in a standardized gene region as a basis for sequence recognition. Although this approach remains controversial in some circles, the Consortium for the Barcode of Life now includes more than 120 member organizations in 40 nations. The rapid growth of interest in DNA barcoding reflects both the scientific promise of this approach and the need for a newly sophisticated capacity for species recognition to curb invasives, to better manage agricultural and forestry pests and to advance biological research at large. Most prior DNA barcoding studies have been modest in taxonomic and geographic scope. However, because of my lab's deep involvements in DNA barcoding, we are able to execute substantive projects. Over the next 5 years, I will direct my NSERC Discovery research to the assembly of a comprehensive DNA barcode library for 35,000 species of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) that occur in North America and Australia. The progress of this work will be aided by collaborations with taxonomists and ecologists on each continent. By coupling an 'industrial-scale' collection capability with our capacity for barcode analysis, we will make rapid progress. Our work will demonstrate the feasibility of developing barcode libraries for even the most diverse insect groups.  The resultant barcode library will be an important enabling tool for much biological research; it will certainly also aid taxonomic work by speeding species discovery. Finally, our work will reveal much about species ages and origins. The contrast between patterns of diversity in Australia and North America, two continents with divergent histories of climate and biogeography, promises intriguing new insights into speciation.

"Normal brain function critically depends on the integrity of biological networks that regulate the expression of genes.  Discovered recently from studies in worms, microRNAs constitute a novel class of key regulators of gene expression regulation at the posttranscriptional level in the cell. Studies in animal models lacking all microRNAs have shown that they are essential for life as well as proper brain development. At this moment, fundamental questions such as how microRNAs interact and how they are globally implicated in neurobiology remain unanswered. Furthermore, the number and identity of microRNAs (and genes they regulate) implicated in neuronal development, particularly in a mammalian system, are unknown. In the current project we want to make use of the very well defined primary hippocampal neuron system to address these questions. As almost all the cells in culture follow in a synchronized way the different differentiation steps as seen in brain, from a neuronal round precursor cell towards fully polarized neurons with clear axon and dendritic subdomains and synaptic activity, it is possible to follow in a quantitative and qualitative way gradual changes in gene expression. We propose to investigate the role of microRNAs, first at a global level and then individually, in modulating the neuronal phenotype. These experiments will allow a first systematic investigation of how microRNAs contribute to the complexity of the neuronal network.

"Who has never experienced a song getting ""stuck"" in the mind, repeating itself over and over? This phenomenon, called ""earworm"" or ""obsessive songs"", has received little scientific attention, perhaps because of its private, benign and unexpected nature. In this proposal we propose that obsessive songs represent an invaluable opportunity to investigate the mind's functioning through the interplay between perception, emotional drive, cognitive function, memory and behavioural mechanisms. The proposal has four objectives. The first objective is to establish the characteristics of obsessive songs and examine if they can be recorded and analyzed. The second objective is to investigate the possibility that obsessive songs can be elicited in the laboratory by exposure to catchy popular tunes (e.g. the Hockey Night in Canada anthem, Jingle Bells, etc.). The third objective will test the hypothesis that obsessive songs activate specific brain areas similar but also distinct from the ones involved in musical imagery and perception. More specifically, we will examine the role of brain structures that are involved in feedback signals that make the difference between imagery and real sounds from the environment, and brain structures that are involved in the inability to perform switching between tasks. The fourth objective is to test the hypothesis that obsessive songs can be modulated by inhibiting specific brain region activity by applying targeted transcranial magnetic stimulation.

"Soils are complex and dynamic components of the ecosystem in which they occur. The many properties and behavior of soil, can exhibit considerable variability in space (laterally and vertically) and over time. An understanding of the relation between soil variability, and the factors that control it, is fundamental to refining management systems, so as to minimize potential soil degradation, as well as guide soil rehabilitation. On-going advancements in instrumentation are allowing us to acquire increasingly-detailed information about intact soils; specifically, high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT) can reveal the intricate configuration of the various soil components at the microscopic level. This information provides the opportunity for researchers to develop computer models to help understand the complex functioning of soils, including biological activity, from which it may be possible to predict the impact of changes in environmental conditions and/or management regimes. Through support of the Canadian Foundation for Innovation-New Opportunities and the Ontario Innovation Trust, a microCT laboratory, dedicated to the study of soil, was established at the University of Guelph (in 2002) - it is the only one in Canada and among only a few in the world primarily at the service of soil science. Consequently, it has attracted the attention of soil researchers and students world-wide and has become a node for such research. The refurbishment of the X-ray source, will result in a globally unique imaging system. This will allow the University of Guelph, and by extension Canada, to remain in the international forefront of research in X-ray computed tomography of soils.

Ourresearch will focus on soils located at 23 benchmark sites, established in the late 1980's and early 1990's, for which considerable background information have been gather, and on which other studies have since been conducted. Key to this research will be the utilization of high-resolution computed tomography (CT scanning), which can provide detailed information about the internal configuration of the soil components, including the pore network.",Environment,"Environmental Earth Sciences"
"In this information age, we often collect continuous time data:  at least conceptually our data sets consist of functions, rather than just real numbers and vectors.   For instance, in lab experiments with wheel-running mice, we can continuously monitor the activity level of each mouse as a function of time.  So for each mouse we observe a function that describes wheel-running.  We may be interested in the wheel-running speed, or how it relates to, e.g., body mass.  The challenges of statistical analyses of such data are the realm of functional data analysis (FDA).



Some questions in evolutionary biology are best answered via the FDA approach.  For instance, suppose the above-mentioned wheel-running mice were bred for fast wheel-running at age 8 weeks. We would expect that their progeny would also be fast wheel runners at age 8 weeks. But what about at other ages? Perhaps their progeny would be fast wheel runners at all ages.  Or perhaps being fast when young goes with being slow when old - that is, there is a trade-off for fastness in youth.   One must look at the entire life history of wheel running to understand the effects of  selection, and one should take into account other factors such as body mass and food consumption.

"The fundamental goal of ecology is to understand the factors that determine the abundance, distribution and diversity of organisms in nature.  The urgency of this task is increasing because of mounting losses of species due to degradation and destruction of natural habitats.  Human alterations of landscapes have fragmented many habitats resulting in direct area loss and reduced distribution of species.  As human populations grow, more natural habitat is converted to agriculture, forestry and urban use, and expanding road networks act as sources of mortality and barriers to many organisms.  This artificial patchiness impedes movements of individuals among populations and less habitat results in smaller populations carrying increased risk of extinction. The ultimate result of fragmentation is loss of biodiversity.  Human actions are also accelerating global warming which is altering precipitation patterns and the frequency and severity of natural disturbances such as wildfire.  Human actions also place increased importance on the efficacy of our protected area systems for conservation. My research program explores how landscape features, habitat fragmentation and habitat degradation affect the movements and diversity of amphibians. Amphibians play a vital role in nature because they act as both important predators and prey in many food webs, and they use habitats on both land and in water.  Amphibians often constitute a major portion of total biomass and they play a major role in energy transfer between land and water.  Amphibians are also sensitive to environmental change because of biological characteristics such as their skin and dependence on water.  These attributes make amphibians excellent indicators of ecosystem health because they act as proverbial 'canaries in coalmines.' My research provides valuable insights into amphibian ecology and conservation when about one third of all amphibians are threatened with extinction. I endeavour to expedite the transfer of knowledge from my research for effective conservation and I use my program as a vehicle to train Canada's next generation of ecologists.  This research also contributes to Canada's obligations as a signatory of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.","Advancement of knowledge","Evolution & Ecology"

"The Holy Grail of muscle biochemistry is to understand how muscle works. The operational components of a muscle can be likened to parts in an automobile. Automobiles have: an engine, an ignition, fuel delivery and brakes. Muscles have molecules called proteins, which can do all of these things. They produce a 'cool' system of movement; coordinated motion without having to resort to combustion. The biochemist's prime directive is to 'open the hood' of the muscle and look inside.



Each glimpse constitutes one experiment. The combined results of many experiments enable researchers to draw up a blueprint of the inner-machinery, of what each protein is doing. Only when we know the role of each working component, will it be possible to make modifications to a muscle or repair one when it malfunctions.



The experiments described in the application are expected to generate new knowledge on one of the key proteins in muscle, actin. We have discovered a new form of actin in certain bony fishes such as salmon and herring, which we propose helps these migratory species to swim in a particular way. By understanding how one protein - actin - can make a muscle work differently, we will understand more about what this protein is actually doing.  This is the aim of my application for a Discovery grant.

"The proposed work aims at establishing quantitative biophysical rules describing the interaction of drugs and other small molecules with biological and liposomal membranes. These are of fundamental interest since virtually all drugs have to interact with membranes; they may bind to membrane receptors, act by changing membrane properties, or need to cross membranes to reach their target. Furthermore, artificial membranes (liposomes) are loaded with drugs for targeted drug delivery and optimized release.

We plan to determine and model which and how key properties of the membrane and the additive govern the uptake of the additive, its permeation through the membrane, and changes of membrane properties induced by the additive. The results will shed light on the mechanisms of action of pharmaceutically relevant molecules (e.g., antibiotic peptides, penetration enhancers, anaesthetics) and they will provide rules for the optimization of drugs and drug formulations (including liposomal drug delivery vehicles) regarding their efficacy, selectivity, and pharmacokinetics. 

To achieve this goal, we plan to apply a number of newly developed, biophysical techniques such as pressure perturbation calorimetry and new assays for titration calorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy along with established methods.

"Video streaming over the Internet is getting very popular. Many video objects are made available online and numerous users are streaming video everyday. In addition, the increasing processing power of personal computers and the availability of high speed Internet services encourage users to demand more and higher quality video content. This escalating demand for high-quality video content imposes significant costs on content providers, because they need to commensurately upgrade their streaming servers and purchase more network bandwidth to cope with the demand. The peer-to-peer (P2P) computing paradigm is a promising approach that can alleviate much of these costs, because it utilizes already-deployed resources and minimizes the need for expensive infrastructure. This research investigates the applicability of the P2P computing paradigm in designing large-scale content distribution systems. The focus of the research is on high-quality video streaming for on-demand and live systems. To provide high-quality, we address several research problems, including: modeling and analyzing the system streaming capacity, optimizing video quality for heterogeneous receivers, designing efficient transmission scheduling algorithms, and making the proposed P2P system ISP friendly. The proposed research has direct benefits to the industrial partner, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). It will enable CBC to reduce the cost of operating streaming services over the Internet, to offer these services to more users, and to enhance the quality of the offered video content. The results from this project can be used by other Canadian content providers to design and operate more efficient streaming services that can render the best quality to various clients. Better quality will motivate more people to participate in streaming services, which will create a larger customer base and more profit for the Canadian companies. Cost efficiency and ease of deployment will also motivate small-scale companies to adopt the P2P model to offer streaming services to their customers and employees.

"With an increasing fraction of the population having access to high-speed network connections and the abundance of low-cost powerful computing devices, more services are continually made possible over the Internet. One such service that has recently been in high demand is multimedia communication in various forms, including on-demand streaming, live broadcasting, video conferencing, and collaborative virtual environments. Participants in multimedia communication systems typically seek the highest possible quality. These participants, however, use quite heterogeneous computing resources. Heterogeneity arises from many sources, including network bandwidth, processing capacity, network delay, display resolution, and energy constraints. Supporting such heterogeneity is a challenging task. Current systems typically use nonscalable coding techniques for video streams. Therefore, they either degrade the quality for all participants to accommodate the least-powerful one, or they offer a very few versions of the same stream to provide limited scalability. This is clearly insufficient in increasingly heterogeneous environments. Furthermore, nonscalable coding systems cannot fully utilize client resources, nor can they maximize the quality for all clients. Unlike the case with nonscalable coders, various representations of the same video stream with different bit rates and qualities can be produced using scalable coders. Scalable coding techniques thus have the potential to support a wide range of clients. A number of research challenges, however, need to be addressed to realize this potential.  The goal of the proposed research is to analyze and understand scalable coding techniques, and to design several optimization and streaming algorithms to make the best possible use of them in real multimedia systems. Scalability is considered along several dimensions: client-perceived quality, power consumption, computation complexity, and multi-views (streams). The results of this research will enable faster and wider adoption of scalable coding techniques in various multimedia communication systems. This will, in turn, yield better quality for users, and more efficient utilization of network and server resources.","Information and communication services","Computing and Information Sciences - A"
"When a foreign substance - a virus or bacterium - invades the tissues of a higher vertebrate, the organism defends itself through the immune response.  The immune system is highly adaptive - it is able to ""learn"" to respond to an enormous variety of pathogens.  In order for a disease to infect a host, it must circumvent the immune system (i.e. mutation), grow at a faster rate than it is killed by the immune system or, as in the case of HIV, infect the immune system itself.

     Over the last several decades much time and effort has been spent on basic research related to immune system/pathogen dynamics.  These studies have led to major advances in our understanding of the immunology and molecular biology of pathogen infection and have aided in the development of vaccine/drug therapies that will best aid the immune system.  Despite this progress, many basic questions have remained unanswered as they have been difficult to discern from clinical trials or are, currently, impossible to quantify in-vivo. 

   Mathematical immunology, mathematical models of disease dynamics within an infected host, is currently the only technique that can address these questions.  Mathematical immunology is a relatively new field, but interest in this area has been increasing rapidly due in large part to an enhanced collaboration between mathematicians and experimental scientists, particularly in the area of HIV/AIDS.  The overriding objective of our work is to complement the ongoing work of experimentalists and clinicians by modeling in-host pathogenesis with a realistic level of biological detail.  

   To this end, we will drastically increase the level of biological detail in models predict the in-host dynamics of HIV.  We will also introduce immunological models for acute infections such as measles and influenza, aiming to elucidate the key immune system/pathogen interactions that enable the growth of the pathogen.  Finally, we will develop comprehensive models, which combine in-host and epidemiological models, since immunological processes can greatly influence epidemiological outcomes.

"We often neglect to appreciate that our daily work in a chemical laboratory critically depends on our ability to weigh chemical compounds, starting from reagents for chemical reactions to preparing highly sophisticated mixtures of components used in medical formulations or high-tech devices.

Research in our laboratory focuses on the development of liquid crystal nanocomposites, i.e. a combination of liquid crystalline (LC) materials and nanoparticles (NPs) with different core sizes, core materials, shapes and protective layers, for the next generation of energy-efficient liquid crystal displays (LCDs), holographic devices, or sensors. The development of LCs and LCDs has persuasively shown how large economic success can evolve from a pure research topic. Today, LC information displays enhance the quality of people's lives worldwide. The ever-growing market of mobile phones, flat panel PC monitors, high-resolution TVs, and other electronic consumer products is based on LC technology - that is, on the properties of specifically designed LC molecules or mixtures. My research group shares the opinion of industry leaders such as Merck (Germany) that new or improved display technologies will arise from new materials combinations based on LCs and nanomaterials, if stable suspensions of appropriately functionalized nanomaterials in the LC phase can be produced, and if the nanomaterial improves the optical and electro-optic response of the LC host material.

Our research, in collaboration with leading academic groups in Germany, the UK and the US as well as industry (Merck) requires that we pay particular attention to size, capping agent, and concentration dependencies for the final NP/LC mixtures, since these parameters affect many critical LC characteristics (electro-optic, optical, alignment) quite differently. With the current, fragile microbalance overused and out for repair, our research laboratory is in critical need for a reliable, high precision and state-of-the-art microbalance with real-time weight display that will eliminate weighing errors due to detrimental transfer of precious and expensive LC and NP materials from small weighing pans to final sample preparation vials.

Self-assembly of nanoparticles, a major goal for technological advances is essential for the integration and application of nanomaterials in high-tech devices. My laboratory is developing new approaches for the development of nanomaterials based on the combination of the unique properties of thermotropic (solvent-less) liquid crystals and nanoscale materials with the goal of producing liquid crystal nanocomposites that will respond to external stimuli such as temperature and applied electric fields. Liquid crystals, by their very nature, are perfect candidates for the self-assembly of nanoscale materials, as the liquid crystalline state combines order and mobility at the molecular (nanoscale) level. Composed of anisotropic molecules, liquid crystals interact with external fields and surfaces influencing structure and properties. Liquid crystals have gained great acceptance in many scientific communities; the concept of orientational order and collective molecular motion is recognized in bioscience, contributing to the understanding of cell membranes, muscles, and morphogenesis. In addition, liquid crystals have found widespread use in information displays, biological sensors, as drug delivery vehicles, in photonic band gap structures and in composite negative index materials, in flexible plastic displays, and in optical elements, from controllable lenses to laser beam steering. Liquid crystal science and technology is crossing the boundaries of many fundamental disciplines. Our design of functional liquid crystal nanocomposites will contribute to the nanotech revolution and likely to the discovery or improvement of many high-tech applications in areas such as nanoscale electronics, electro-optics, functional coatings, optical memories, and display devices with new switching modes, lower operating voltages, faster switching speeds, and higher contrast - an industry worth more than $60 billion/yr. - in a world with more LCDs than people.

"I propose to continue investigating the use of predicate logic as a semantics of standard programming constructs, and to advance our understanding of the relation between logic and programming. I have developed my own programming logic in several papers and a book, and I continue to improve it. It applies to both terminating and nonterminating computation, to both sequential and parallel computation, to both stand-alone and interactive computation. It has most recently been applied to probabilistic programming, and to quantum programming.  The logic includes time and space complexity. With the use of a theorem prover, it

is being developed into a practical programming aid.

My programming logic is also being used for deriving VLSI circuits. The circuits are neither synchronous (global clock) nor asynchronous (local feedback); instead, for timing they use the novel technique of calculated local delays. I give a formal semantics that works for both circuits and programs in order to prove that the circuits correctly implement the programs.

I propose an alternative to least fixpoint semantics, called refinement semantics, that is more useful for programming. From it I derive new loop rules that are simpler and more general than the old ones.

To help make logic more familiar and usable, I propose a unification of boolean algebra and number algebra. The laws of the unified algebra apply to both numbers and booleans. Calculation, which is commonly used for quantitative problems, can be used for logic problems also, including programming.

The logical foundation of programming is a question of great theoretical significance in computer science. Pursuit of a technology that aids programmers to write correct and efficient programs is of considerable practical importance.","Computer software","Computing and Information Sciences - A"

"Healthy cells require the synthesis and maintenance of correctly folded proteins. Environmental stresses and disease states can perturb this situation and if left unchecked could result in cell death. Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are a class of molecular chaperones that play important roles in cellular homeostasis and protein folding as well as protecting the cell against numerous stresses including heat shock and exposure to heavy metals, reactive oxygen species and arsenite. During cellular stress, sHsps, in their role as molecular chaperones, bind to denatured protein, inhibit their aggregation, and facilitate their refolding once favorable conditions have returned. Also, sHsp synthesis or mutations have been associated with various diseases such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, various neuropathologies and muscle myopathy. Over the past 23 years, the applicant's laboratory has been actively researching sHsp gene expression and function in the model frog system, Xenopus laevis. They have made significant progress in the characterization of expression and function of the sHsp family, Hsp30. Recently, they reported on the presence and molecular chaperone function of a second Xenopus sHsp, Hsp27, a human Hsp27 homolog. The long term goals of the applicant's research program are to understand the regulation and function of Xenopus sHsps. The specific aims of this grant proposal are to: 1) analyze the mechanism(s) associated with developmental regulation of Hsp30 gene expression, 2) characterize the molecular chaperone domains of Hsp30 and Hsp27, 3) determine the effect of Hsp30 and Hsp27 depletion in heat shocked Xenopus embryos, 4) examine the effect of proteasomal inhibition on sHsp gene expression in cultured cells and embryos, and 5) characterize the effect of cadmium on Hsp30 and Hsp27 gene expression in Xenopus cultured cells and embryos. This hypothesis-driven research proposal will build on previous work and explore new areas related to sHsp gene expression and function. Knowledge regarding sHsp structure and function will provide a better understanding of various disease states.

Studies in comparative planetology address the dynamical history of the Earth and planets, the nature of large scale planetary turbulence, the origins of the geomagnetic planetary magnetic fields, the origin of life on Earth and the possibility of life on Mars. We use numerical models of planetary convection along with observational and analytical methods in projects that range from integrated studies of global and regional seismology and the dynamics of solid-state convection in the Earth's mantle to  numerical simulations of winds and magnetic fields of the outer planets. The mantle dynamics and seismology study is aimed at understanding the fate of subducting slabs as they interact with the upper mantle transition zone and penetrate into the deep mantle. This work is being carried out with a PhD student and in collaboration with the global seismology group at U of A.   In the planetary dynamics models, numerical simulations are compared to models derived from previous and ongoing space missions (such as the Cassini spacecraft, currently orbiting Saturn). This work is in collaboration with researchers from UCLA and the Max Planck Institute for Solar System research in Lindau, Germany. Coupled models of convective dynamo action and solar wind - magnetosphere interaction are presently being developed to study the Earth, Mercury and Mars. These models help us to understand Mercury's intrinsic and relatively weak magnetic field, which will be mapped by the MESSENGER spacecraft, starting with a flyby through the magnetosphere in January, 2008 and orbit insertion in 2011. Collaborators include the Space Physics group at U of A, and the Carnegie Institution in Washington DC -- home of the MESSENGER mission.

"The main advances in materials science in the 21st century are going to be based on controlling nanostructured hybrid and composite systems. In magnetism this path started in the early eighties. UHV fabrication of complex heterogeneous magnetic multilayer structures and superlattices has allowed one to create unique magnetic materials. The success in this field has occurred very quickly and has led to new and revolutionary device applications.  The spin of the electron rather than its charge has created remarkable opportunities in electronics, coined spintronics. In fact the Nobel Prize for 2007 was awarded for the discovery of Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR) by Peter Gruenberg and Albert Fert. To continue the rapid progress in this field requires advances in the understanding of spin interactions in nanoscopic geometries. I use Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) for the deposition of ultrathin films and superlattices.  Radio frequency, Mossbauer, dc and pico second time resolved magneto-optical, electron transport techniques and electron microscope techniques  are employed to identify magnetic and spin dependent electron transport properties. Our studies involve spin dynamics with emphasis on the study of spin currents. Strong electron correlation effects at the ferromagnet-tunneling junction-normal metal interfaces can enhance spin pumping by a factor of ten. At this point one can start to think about developing information processing based on pure spin currents which are not accompanied by the net flow of electric charge. We are going to develop a spin battery using high power spin currents. We will test and optimize the spin injection between ferromagnetic metals and semiconductors giving us an opportunity to develop an efficient spin-transistor. This work will be done in a collaborative effort involving scientists at SFU, UBC, U. Edmonton, McGill U., Max-Planck Institute Halle,  U. Regensburg, and U. Delaware allowing us to cover a wide range of expertise in semiconductors, structural science, magneto-optics, device fabrication, and computer simulations.  The cooperation with UBC, TRIUMF, U. Edmonton, and McGill U. are a part of Canadian Institute For Advanced Research (CIFAR) program.

"Amphibian wildlife are sentinels of our environment and are used as indicators of ecosystem health. Due to their distinctive life history, they transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments and are particularly vulnerable to pollutants. Currently, the available impact assessment tools rely upon acute toxicological endpoints such as mortality. However, exposure to sublethal concentrations of deleterious substances at critical life stages can severely impact species survival. The short term objective of this project is to develop sensitive indicators for the determination of disruption of a critical life stage (metamorphosis) of a native frog species based upon transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses of target tissues in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we focus upon the effects of one of the most extensively-used nanoparticles, nanosilver, whose environmental impact via intentional and unintentional release is unknown. Synergistic effects of nanosilver with emerging chemicals of concern and municipal wastewater will also be evaluated to identify cellular processes that are most vulnerable. These studies set the foundation for the long term objective of developing better predictive and diagnostic tools for aquatic environmental protection.",Environment,"Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Environment"
"Thyroid hormones (THs) are important regulators of growth, development and cellular metabolism. Although important in all vertebrates including humans, a classic example of the diverse effects of THs is the normal postembryonic development of the frog where THs trigger tadpole metamorphosis. The major mechanism of TH action involves the regulation of genes by nuclear receptors (TRs) which change gene structure and this pathway is highly conserved in vertebrates. However, how tissues differentially respond to TH remains enigmatic and likely involves differences in tissue-specific modulators of TR complex action and post-translational modification of TR complex components. Moreover, these differences may render certain target tissues more susceptible to the actions of environmental pollutants at very low, environmentally-relevant concentrations. There is a great need to identify the regulators of TR action in normal cells as they represent key targets for the disruption of TH signaling by environmental contaminants. The long term objective of the proposed research program is aimed at identifying the molecular mechanisms whereby THs elicit multiple cellular outcomes and to discover how environmental contaminants disrupt TH action. We recently identified new regulators of TR action, the INhibitor of Growth (ING) tumor suppressor proteins, which are differentially influenced by TH depending upon tissue context. The overall short-term objectives of the research program are to 1) characterize the effects of ING proteins on cellular responses to TH, 2) elucidate the interactions between ING proteins and TRs, and 3) evaluate ING proteins as targets for environmental contaminant-induced disruption of TH signaling. This work will provide fundamental knowledge about how a tumor suppressor normally associated with cancer regulates hormonal processes and will shed light on the mechanisms of action of two common environmental contaminants that disrupt TH action.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Cell Biology"

"Constraint satisfaction problems model many problems in scheduling, logistics, databases, and artificial intelligence. It has been observed that when the constraint language (or the constraint 'template') is fixed, the problems seem to fall into only two categories - polynomial time solvable or NP-complete. On the other hand, it is known that (unless P=NP) there must exist problems which are not solvable in polynomial time, but which are not quite NP-complete. Whether or not there are such 'intermediate' constraint satisfaction problems (with a fixed template) has become a very important open problem in theoretical computer science, driving much research effort based on algebra, analysis, logic, and combinatorics. Graphs seem to have an important role to play. Our results in graph theory have motivated the original problem, as well as several subsequent developments. It now appears that they will continue to motivate the research efforts. In this proposal, we propose research in the complexity of certain variants of graph homomorphism problems which would have implications for (variants of) general constraint satisfaction problems. These include list homomorphism, minimum cost homomorphism, and matrix partition problems.

"The objective of the proposed research is to optimize the fermentation of waste or low cost substrates for the production of renewable fuels and chemicals, with an emphasis on the fermentation of difficult to ferment pentose (five carbon) sugars. The use of lignocellulosic biomass to produce renewable fuels results in large reductions in greenhouse gas emissions compared to using fossil fuels or even compared to using ethanol from corn. Examples of potential low cost substrates include waste lignocellulosic biomass from the forestry industry, various pulp mill streams, and mountain pine beetle killed wood. In addition to environmental benefits, using low value mountain pine beetle killed wood for biorefinery feedstock will help increase economic diversification in affected areas, and increasing the number of products produced at pulp mills would decrease sensitivity to changes in pulp prices. 

       Unlike conventional fermentation substrates, substrates produced from lignocellulosic biomass contain many inhibitors. Current fermentation obstacles include the need for pretreatment to detoxify the substrate, and the difficulty of fermenting pentose sugars. Pentose fermentation is generally slow, sensitive to inhibitors, and requires genetically modified organisms. One strategy to work with less than ideal fermentation substrates and the resulting low fermentation rates is to use continuous fermentations with cell recycle. The optimum yeast growth rate, aeration levels, nutrient addition, and reactor hydraulics will be found in order to eliminate the need for expensive hydrolysate detoxification, maximize product yield, and minimize by-product formation. Results will be directly applicable to current industrial fermentations of sulfite pulp mill wastewaters, and also to the fermentation of other difficult to ferment substrates projected to be a part of biomass refineries, such as hemicellulose streams from Kraft pulping and biomass hydrolysates from forestry waste.","Alternative energy resources","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng."

"The two main themes of the planned research are the tectonic settings of diamond deposits, in particular primary diamond deposits occurring in kimberlites and other igneous rocks, and problems of diamond storage in the Earth's lithosphere. The first theme involves studying the various hierarchies of tectonic controls on primary diamond deposits, including the formation of the diamond-bearing source rocks in the roots cratons, the preservation of diamonds until they are transported to the surface, and the regional and local structural controls of kimberlite formation and near-surface emplacement. This research will focus mainly on the kimberlites of the Slave and Superior Provinces of the Canadian Shield, where deep-crustal and upper mantle geophysical data were collected by the LITHOPROBE and POLARIS programs. The second theme involves laboratory studies of diamonds from the Slave Province and South Africa to investigate whether intracrystalline strain in brown diamonds indicates that these deformed diamonds were stored metastably in the lithosphere. The possibility of metastable storage is suggested by recent advances in high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) treatment of natural diamonds which have shown that brown diamonds can be transformed (annealed?) into yellow or white diamonds after a relatively short period (as little as 20 minutes) of treatment under conditions that only slightly overstep the minimum pressure and temperature of the diamond stability field. The proposed research is designed to test the annealing hypothesis and its implications for xenolith and xenocryst-based upper mantle models in which it is commonly assumed that diamond-bearing assemblages were transported from depths corresponding to the pressures of the diamond stability field. The results may have a profound impact on current models for area selection in diamond exploration.

"Pregnancy is accompanied by dramatic uterine adaptations to allow for development of a healthy placenta and to provide a safe environment in which to grow. This changes abruptly at the end of pregnancy when the uterus becomes activated and begins contracting to deliver the baby. Current research on the regulation of all these uterine changes focus primarily on the roles of proteins, hormones and prostaglandins. A well-known phospholipid which has recently been identified as an important factor within the reproductive field is sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). However, little is known about the role of S1P in uterine adaptations to pregnancy. The long-term objectives of my program of research are to define the role of S1P in pregnancy-induced events such as 1) implantation and control of trophoblast invasion; 2) uterine activation prior to labour and 3) stimulation of myometrial contractions. 

This grant proposal focuses on the second objective, the regulation and role of S1P in the decidua, particularly with respect to uterine activation. The short-term objectives are to 1) investigate the S1P signalling pathway in human decidua isolated from women in labour (activated; vaginal birth) or women not in labour (not activated; caesarean section); 2) study hormone or cytokines that regulate the expression of enzymes or receptors in the S1P signalling pathway in decidua; 3) measure production of uterine activation proteins in decidua in response to treatment with S1P; and 4) evaluate the effects of manipulation of the S1P signalling pathway on uterine activation and parturition in a mouse model. 

This research will increase our understanding of the basic physiology of the extensive changes that occur within the uterus to stimulate expulsion of the fetus. Establishing S1P as an important mediator of these changes will lead to further research into the interactions of S1P with other already established factors important during uterine activation. Importantly, a solid understanding of the factors and interactions involved in this normal human process is critical for future studies of abnormal situations.

"The proposed research program is directed towards the development of advanced and novel inorganic materials in thin film form (coatings). The focus of the research is on ternary titanium carbide and nitride phases. The phases belong to a relatively new class of materials and exhibit a unique set of properties due to their nano-layered structure. The research encompasses both fundamental and applied aspects of the materials. Fundamental investigations include rational design and selection, synthesis, processing, characterization, and testing of the coatings through analytical and computational means. The research is expected to result in important strides towards gaining a fundamental understanding of the ternary carbides and nitrides by addressing the intricate relationships between processing, structure, and properties.



The proposed research is quite interdisciplinary and we are expecting new research directions to arise in the mid- to long-term through collaborations with researchers and partners on campus and outside the university. The research offers excellent training opportunities by gaining transferable skills through first-hand experience with a variety of analytical tools and methods, involvement in computational work, and interaction with collaborators. It is expected that the proposed research will contribute to building research capacity of Laurentian Univ. in the area of Materials Science and Engineering



Beside advancing the state of knowledge, we strive to apply gained know-how in energy-intensive applications. These include coatings for high-temperature environments, separation, and energy storage of strategic importance to Laurentian Univ., the province, and Canada.

"Factors controlling the movement of trace elements from soil to plants



A series of experiments will be conducted to study the mechanisms that contribute to the accumulation of trace elements in plants such as Swiss chard, barley and beans. A combination of growth experiments in highly controlled environment, using pots in growth chambers, and less-well controlled environments in the field will be used. Soil samples with a wide range of properties (trace element contents, pH, and soil organic matter) will be collected and used in experiments designed to test different hypotheses concerning the different mechanisms of trace element uptake. From a human health perspective, the most common trace elements of concern in soils affected by anthropogenic contamination are arsenic, cadmium and lead, while the essential elements copper, nickel and zinc are very abundant in some soils near industrial sites. These six elements will receive the most attention in this research program but other, less common and less well understood elements (such as vanadium, chromium, cobalt, selenium, rubidium, molybdenum, silver, cerium, thallium and barium) will also be measured in the soils and plant tissues collected. Mathematical models will be developed from the research results so that uptake into plants can be estimated from the properties of the ecosystem. The results of our research could also have positive economic benefits through better use of micronutrients in soils and lead to more accurate site-specific soil quality criteria for agricultural (and garden) soils. The elucidation of the mechanisms that control soil to plant transfers of trace elements will contribute to the knowledge base needed to identify those aspects that we need to include in a model to predict how soil trace elements are incorporated into the food we eat.

"Demonstrating the time equivalence of events, or chronocorrelation, involves all available means including biostratigraphy, numerical dating, remanent magnetism and geochemical signatures. Chronocorrelation of the Late Paleozoic and Triassic (355 to 200 million years ago) has immediate relevance to changes we are witnessing today on Planet Earth, including climate change and dramatic changes in biodiversity.  Understanding the detailed dynamics that led to climate changes and biodiversity collapse will demand high resolution and temporal precision and the collaborative efforts of a community of geoscientists. This project is part of that effort and largely aimed at producing biostratigraphic (temporal) control using conodonts. Conodonts were an eel-like animal whose only hard parts included microscopic teeth. The rapid evolution of this extinct group is represented by distinct changes in form of the teeth. The relevance and significance of this research is indisputable; many of the changes we are experiencing or anticipating today are foreshadowed by events that occurred during the Late Paleozoic and Triassic.  The Pennsylvanian and Early Permian were witness to periods of glacial and interglacial events resulting in rapid sea-level changes, an issue particularly relevant in today's discussions of the consequences of potential global warming.  During the Early Permian plate tectonics brought a series of continental fragments together as a giant supercontinent (Pangea), resulting in the increase of aridity in much of the continental interior, another concern of modern climate change as we continue to see record temperatures over much of the planet. All of these factors contributed toward an ecologic collapse and major extinction, particularly near the end of the Permian - an extinction often referred to as the greatest extinction in Earth's history (95% of species).  The Triassic began as a desolate world nearly barren of life, but during a recovery interval, life began to diversify again in a series of pulses. Today we are living during an interglacial period that has seen profound changes in climate and biodiversity. What will the future bring? Better understanding the timing of past events may provide an answer.

"The physical and chemical behaviour of volcanoes depends to a great extend on the properties of the molten material or magma beneath the volcano. Magmas are mixtures of silicate melt, crystals and dissolved gases. The melt phase plays an important role because its structure influences properties such as rheology, diffusion and eruptive style. However, in situ studies of melts are technically difficult and it is easier to study the quenched melt or glass. Geological research into the structure of melts and glasses has been ongoing since the 30s and continues, with large research groups in the USA, Japan, and Europe actively in this area. In general, simple melt compositions are prepared and quenched to glass. The glasses produced have properties closely analogous to the corresponding melt. These glasses are then probed by sophisticated instrumentation and analysis of the spectroscopic data provides key information with which to interpret the speciation, structure and coordination of the glasses. By establishing how composition affects the structural properties of the synthetic glasses it is possible to establish a basis upon which to develop structural models of more complex natural systems. Here I propose to study the influence of composition on 1) the coordination of elements such as O, B, Al, Fe and Ti, 2) the influence of different alkalis (Li, Na, K, Rb) on the extended glass structure, 3) perform in-situ studies on melts and attempt to observe structural changes with changing temperature and, 4) the suitability of using synthetic glasses to host nuclear waste products. These projects address specific well-defined areas of current interest in geological glass/melt research. A significant portion of the research will be carried out at the Canadian Light Source (CLS), the recently opened national synchrotron radiation facility in Saskatoon. I have extensive experience with the instrumentation and techniques that will be employed and have developed an international reputation in their application to glass/melt research. In addition, some of the proposed research is collaborative with colleagues at IPGP (Paris) and IMPMC (Paris) and will utilise instrumentation and synchrotron facilities outside of Canada.","Materials sciences","Solid Earth Sciences"

"Darwin suggested that evolution proceeds very slowly, a view almost universally accepted for the next 140 years. Over the past dozen years, however, a dramatic shift has taken place toward the idea that ongoing evolution is occurring all around us, so-called ""rapid"" or ""contemporary"" evolution.  Some striking examples involve the evolution of antiobiotic resistance in bacteria, drug resistance in HIV, insecticide resistance in crop pests, herbicide resistance in weeds, body size in harvested cod, and horn size in hunted bighorn sheep. 



Now that contemporary evolution is considered commonplace, researchers have become interested in the consequences for ecological dynamics. That is, how do evolutionary changes influence (for example) population sizes, food web structure, and nutrient cycling? Answers to these questions will give us some indication as to how evolution might influence the response of biological diversity to environmental change, and the attendant influence on eco-system services. 



Research on these ""eco-evolutionary dynamics"" often requires determining the genetic basis for phenotypic differences between populations. This determination can be made by raising individuals from different populations under different conditions in the laboratory. The equipment requested here will greatly facilitate such experiments for small fishes. The equipment comprises an integrated water system that has three discrete and self-contained racks of fish tanks, with each rack having sixty 2.8 L tanks and six 6 L tanks. The water in each rack is re-circulating and so can be monitored, filtered, and manipulated as a unit. The presence of filters and automatic water replacement dramatically reduces operational costs, improves standardization, and improves water quality to the benefit of the fish and the experiment.",Environment,"Evolution and Ecology"

For guppies, I will consider how contemporary evolution influences the success of populations experiencing environmental change. For stickleback, I will consider how contemporary evolution influences the distributions of populations.  For Darwin's finches, I will consider reciprocal interactions between seed distributions (ecology) and beak sizes (evolution).

"My research seeks to understand the evolutionary forces that promote and constrain biological diversity. With respect to promoting forces, I focus on how ecological differences between populations drive divergent adaptations, and how these adaptations might then cause the split of one species into several (""ecological speciation""). With respect to constraining factors, I focus on how the dispersal of individuals between environments might constrain adaptive divergence, and thereby hamper ecological speciation. These investigations are conducted in three exemplary natural systems: threespine stickleback fish living in lakes versus streams, Trinidadian guppies living in high- versus low-predation environments, and Galapagos finches eating large versus small seeds. The use of three complementary systems is important because it enhances my ability to draw more general conclusions about the evolution of biological diversity.

    Most previous work has sought to simply demonstrate the plausibility and occurrence of ecological speciation. I will focus more systematically on the conditions that are required for ecological speciation to begin, and that influence how far it proceeds. These more general questions are important because many populations occupying divergent environments are clearly not splitting into separate species. I will address this topic with a variety of studies that include two major new initiatives. The first will examine how reductions in dispersal might promote ecological speciation. The second will test for the importance of competition in enhancing ecological speciation. Each question is important in its own right, and their intersection is particularly interesting. That is, two groups must mix if their competition is to drive their divergence, and yet too much mixing can constrain divergence. 

    My work should contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the forces that influence the evolution of biological diversity. It may also aid conservation efforts that use evolutionary considerations to help preserve biological diversity, and to perhaps even recover some of that which has been lost.",Environment,"Evolution & Ecology"

"In urban sensing, people, more specifically, their cell phones, become location-aware sensors. For example, a person traveling in a car has her cell phone transmit its current location and acceleration to a central server, which combines this data with data received from other cell phones to generate up-to-date traffic information, such as road congestion. There are many other possible types of applications that can be built on this kind of sensing model, considering that the sensing capabilities of cell phones have increased drastically. 

     For urban sensing to become a success, many privacy and security challenges need to be resolved first. In the example above, whereas sending location and acceleration data to the central server allows the server to provide traffic updates, it also enables the server to build a detailed location profile for the owner of the cell phone. In turn, this location profile will likely reveal sensitive information about the owner, which is not in the owner's interest. Therefore, the owner might refuse to let her cell phone participate in urban sensing, unless we guarantee to her that her privacy will not be violated. However, privacy guarantees alone are not sufficient, we also need security guarantees. Again, consider the traffic-update example. Here, a malicious cell phone owner could tamper with her device and have it report wrong location or acceleration data, in an effort to keep traffic away from the route that the owner is taking herself. Therefore, unless an application developer is guaranteed the integrity of the sensed data, he is unlikely to build urban-sensing applications.

     The goals of the proposed research are to bring privacy and security guarantees to urban sensing. In terms of privacy, the research will lead to 1) a privacy-aware architecture for urban sensing where individuals maintain computers that process and forward information and 2) user interfaces for mobile devices that allow individuals to manage their privacy preferences. In terms of security, the research will lead to new integrity mechanisms for urban sensing, where some of these mechanisms will take advantage of protection mechanisms that people (implicitly) already take advantage of in their daily lives.

"Surface flows and mixing in agitated tanks are studied by computational and laboratory methods. The main objective of the research program is to develop a novel numerical model to mimic the hydrodynamic in agitated tanks with a moving convex free surface for inelastic fluids in laminar, transition, and turbulent regime. The use of the fictitious domain technique, within the finite element framework, allows making model versatility irrespective to impeller geometry and kinematics. The developed model is used to describe the hydrodynamics conditions in agitated vessels with desired impeller shapes. Free surface vortex effect on the power draw, axial pumping and dispersive mixing criteria is numerically investigated. On the laboratory side, torque and free surface topography are measured, and coloration-discoloration technique is employed to quantify the degree of mixing homogeneity. The laboratory experiments are guided and complemented by the simulations for validation.

"One of the brain's main jobs is using information from the senses to control action. As physicists and engineers have long realized, information can be represented in different ways - e.g. an object's location can be described relative to the eyes, head or trunk - and a well-chosen representation can simplify computations. I have previously shown that spatial memory represents the locations of objects relative to the eye, and updates these locations whenever the eyes move. My ""conversion-on-demand"" model says this eye-fixed representation is the starting point for the complex geometric computations that lead to goal-directed movements.

    )	The aim of this proposal is to analyze how the brain represents and processes spatial information at various stages of motor control. I have designed behavioural and functional neuroimaging experiments to answer these questions: 1) At what stage in the action does spatial memory transform from an eye-fixed representation to an arm-fixed one?  Specifically, do pointing targets continue to be updated in an eye-fixed frame after the arm movement has been initiated? 2) How does spatial memory compute the changing locations of remembered objects relative to the eyes when the eyes move? How does this differ when objects are localized for perception compared to action, and when the same object is localized both for action and perception? 3) How does spatial memory compute the changing location of remembered objects relative to the hand when the hand moves? 4) In what reference frames and cortical regions does the brain represent spatial information from different senses, and how and where do different representations interact?

    )	These projects address some of the central issues in cognitive and sensorimotor neuroscience. The results will have implications for many common and debilitating neurological disorders, for motor-skills training, for teleoperations such as remote surgery, and possibly also for robotics.

"The growing demand for large amounts of biopharmaceuticals, the increasing number of mammalian cell products in development and the necessity to modernize and speed up the production of vaccines for pandemic readiness are driving the need to develop efficient, cost-effective and robust cell culture processes. Despite progress in mammalian cell technologies, significant challenges still remain; the complex behaviour of mammalian cells in culture is currently only partially understood because of the multitude of parameters governing cell growth, metabolism and productivity. In turn, this lack of knowledge has hindered the development of effective control strategies, which are vital for reducing production costs, ensuring high yields and maintaining product quality. Advancements in this area are thus needed and crucial to reduce the time-to-market and increase the supply of new and much needed therapeutic agents to the clinic and market.

The proposed research aims at understanding and characterising the cellular metabolism and physiology as a rational basis for the development and control of mammalian cell culture processes. The proposed research program will specifically investigate: A) the development of an accurate metabolic model able to provide a quantitative description of the cells' physiological state; B) the characterisation of the cellular physiological response to changes in process conditions and the ensuing effects on productivity; and C) the development of strategies to control the physiological state and productivity of cells in culture. This approach will be applied to two industrially relevant systems: the production of Intereferon-alpha and the production of adenovirus vaccine. The methodology will be based on mathematical modeling combined with mass spectrometry analysis. By addressing the need to accelerate process development, this research can contribute to alleviate the bottleneck in protein production and should impact positively on the health and welfare of Canadians. Due to its strong interdisciplinary nature, this study will additionally provide students with training in broad aspects of biotechnology and prepare them for diverse careers in biochemical engineering.

"It is generally agreed that primate brains and cognition are, in large measure, a product of social life. There is less agreement on both the particular nature of this social cognition and how we would recognise it if we were to observe wild primates for whom, after all, it has had the most evolutionary importance. We argue that primate cognition has not been selected to allow animals to plan ahead by shoring up valuable relationships. It is, instead, an ability to respond rapidly to changing circumstances, without regard for the future, and to make use of the structure of both the social and physical worlds to reduce the cognitive load of decision-making.



To assess the accuracy of this perspective, our research program sets out to observe two monkey species in the wild in order to test a range of predictions about how individuals tap into available information in the social and physical environments and the extent to which their behaviour accommodates it. It builds on earlier theoretical and empirical work by concentrating on three different questions: How monkeys decide where to go each day and how they coordinate their movement; how females use grooming as a commodity with which to trade and how its value is regulated; how females regulate the reproductive behaviour of males and other females and how their ability to do so is set by the local environment. This is essentially basic, academic research that has implications for the way we view human cognition.

"This proposal will focus on two major themes: 1) single particle aerosol studies using a newly constructed apparatus capable of doing mass spectrometry on size-selected individual sub-micron aerosol particles; and 2) coherent control using shaped femtosecond pulses. 

We have built a unique apparatus for single particle aerosol studies, which uses synthetic aerosols of known composition, which are reacted under defined conditions for specific periods of time with various oxidants in order to model tropospheric reactions on typical aerosol particles. A unique feature of our apparatus is that the laser evaporated single aerosol particles are analyzed by photoionization mass spec using a tuneable pulsed vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser. 

Our program in coherent control is based on using very broadband femtosecond laser pulses (pulses of 120fs or 40fs), which can be tuned from the infrared to the ultraviolet and shaped both with respect to phase and amplitude as a function of frequency. We have had significant success in two main areas: non-linear spectroscopy (specifically coherent anti-Stokes Raman, or CARS), and coherent quantum state manipulation through a new technique called piecewise adiabatic passage (PAP). We propose to use these newly developed methods for a number of experiments in control of excited state dynamics, microscopy, and ultracold molecules.

"The modern world, with its computers, mobile phones, navigation systems, etc. functions on basis of quantum mechanics, as applied to solid state physics. Just as the dicovery of semiconductors ushered this new era half a century ago, new materials such as high temperature superconductors or carbon based nanotubes and graphene promise spectacular new technological developments. However, basic physical mechanisms operating in these materails and governing their conductive properties are at the moment rather poorly understood, and seem completely different from the known ones. My research hopes to contribute to the understanding of the  physical problems posed by these new classes of materials. The goal is to, through discovery of new physical mechanisms, speed up the technological development, and at the same time use the new knowledge to understand some other relate fundamental problems in physics, such as some forms of the Bose - Einstein condensation, and the quark confinement.

"Until robots or humans are sent to Mars and bring back samples, martian meteorites are the only samples of Mars that we have available for study.  We know they are from Mars because gas trapped within them matches the composition of the martian atmosphere as measured by the Viking landers.  These meteorites provide us with an opportunity study the geology of another planet.  All of the martian meteorites are similar to basalts from the Earth.  By analogy with the Earth, we know that these rocks were formed by crystallization of magma that was melted out of the martian mantle.  This melt ascended to the surface of Mars, where it cooled and crystallized.  There are also minerals within the meteorites that are evidence for the activity of water percolating through the rocks.  In addition we have pockets of glass that formed when local areas within the rock were heated, as a result of the impact that lofted the rock into space and started its journey to Earth.  These pockets of glass are where the martian atmosphere is found.

My research program involves studying the martian meteorites in detail, to determine the conditions under which they formed and were modified throughout their geologic histories. This is done by using state-of-the-art tools that allow the chemical and isotopic analysis of individual mineral grains, and carrying out experiments using high-pressure apparatus and high-temperature furnaces to simulate the conditions of formation in the mantle and crystallization at the surface.  By doing so, we can unravel the geologic processes that have been active on Mars, and learn more about how Mars formed and evolved.  Earth and Mars are very similar in some ways, and different in others.  By comparing the geology of Mars to the geology of Earth, it provides a unique perspective on the Earth's origin and geologic evolution.

"Many of the modern applications of algebra in areas including physics, coding theory, and cryptology depend on a detailed understanding of algebraic structures we call groups, rings, and algebras.  In many of these applications, the algebraic structures were understood well before their potential for applications was realized.  ""Schur Indices and Representation Theory"" is a curiousity-driven research program that seeks to 

increase our understanding of how groups and algebras can be represented as matrices with entries in non-algebraically closed fields such as the field of rational numbers. The Schur index is the invariant which holds the key to a detailed understanding of these representations.  One of the goals of the program is the development of a computer software package that would make the difficult process of Schur index calculation for representations of finite groups accessible to the mathematical research community.  The theoretical research goals for this program include the study of a new theoretical tool in the area of Schur indices known as ""equivalence of G-algebras"", and investigations into a conjecture concerning the possible Schur indices for representations of Coxeter groups that are important in representation theory and discrete geometry.

"A the forefront of today's fastest man-made phenomena, ultrafast lasers drive highly nonlinear optical interactions that can induce absorption in transparent media, create flickering lights in wild spectral colour, or drive self-focusing or defocusing events that generate plasma mirrors or bright luminescent filaments.   These physical phenomena are of wide interest at the forefront of laser science today and underpin further significant practical interest to control powerful laser interactions that can transform materials or tissue through various states of matter from room to sun-like temperature.  In recent work, our research group discovered a significant enhancement of laser filamentation effect when laser bursts were applied at unusually high repetition rate.  The rapid sequence of pulses were observed to drive heat accumulation and other transient effects that temporarily modify the material and affect the interaction of subsequent laser pulses in surprisingly strong ways.  Two important discoveries on which patent disclosures were filed were (1) the role of laser filaments in guiding the formation of exceptional straight and deep microholes at extremely high aspect ratio in transparent glasses and (2) the crack-free cleaving of substrates modified internally with an array of laser filaments.  Both phenomena require substantial more research to unravel the underlying physics and better learn how to control highly nonlinear interactions inside materials.  Preliminary discoveries made with a purpose-built laser resonator show promising opportunities in manufacturing and diagnostic methods for making biomedical devices, sensors, and other microsystems and also for cutting delicate solar energy panels, flat panel displays, fiber optics and microelectronic wafers.  But the world`s laser technology has moved forward dramatically with 100-times more power that we now seek for our interactive research group.  The new equipment is essential to remain world leaders in an area we discovered, to pioneer the science and technology on a commercialization path in the new opportunities of burst-laser filamentation microprocessing.

"Nanoscience and nanotechnology define significant trends today that seek to exploit the new physical laws

encountered as the structures and devices we make become smaller and smaller. In this frenzied race to shrink

the world, nano-optics has evolved as a new discipline to exploit the novel optical phenomena in

nanostructures much smaller than the wavelength of light. Photonic bandgap crystals, metamaterials, and

plasmonics promise to guide light at dimensions below diffraction limits or precisely probe the electron

wavefunction of protein molecules with high optical resolution. Nanochemistry is an equally exciting frontier

of new capabilities for directed and conformal self-organization of molecular and other entities to fashion

nanomaterials with novel optical, biological, physical, chemical, electronic, and magnetic properties.

The proposed research seeks to combine such 'bottom up' nanochemistry with 'top down' laser

nanofabrication to interlace novel 3-D photonic and biophotonic sensor devices for cell-level diagnostic

applications. A multi-disciplinary team crossing the borders between material chemistry, biology, and optical

engineering aim to develop a micro-optofluidic laboratory based on nano-optical media embedded in small

microfluidic channels. The nanoporous structure serves multi-functions, including high-pressure

electro-osmotic pumping and capillary electrochromatography for efficacious separation of cellular content -

proteins, antibodies, metabolites and other nano-scale bioanalytes. The significant innovation lies in the

photonic stopband of the highly ordered dispersive media through which real-time in-situ sensing will reveal

the varying concentrations of bioanalytes as they locally shift the stopband. This interface of multi-disciplinary

nanoscience opens a new and unexplored technology base for greatly improving the functionality of biomedical

tools to benefit Canadian industry while defining new directions for less-invasive diagnoses in health care. The

nano-enabled optofluidic platform promises to transform the way Canadian biologists, security officials,

medical researchers, and health care professionals practice their field.","Medical and health sciences","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Biomedical Technologies"
"The flickering light generated during laser processing is a curse and an opportunity - the undulating light emissions are associated with poorly formed welding seams, non-uniform walls in laser-machined channels, and scattering defects in laser-written optical devices. Nevertheless, lasers serve in formidable ways today in manufacturing, defining the smallest nano-scale features in our most advanced microelectronic chips, carving out biomedical products such as stents (angioplasty) that save lives, and correcting manufacturing mistakes (defects) such as in memory chips and flat panel displays that would otherwise produce 'zero' product yield. Our program has generated a series of science and technology innovations in laser processing of optical materials on which promising new directions in photonics manufacturing and quality-control processes are proposed for development. We have exploited lasers at the edge of the fastest man-made events that strongly interact inside transparent materials. These ultrashort lasers promise facile means for three-dimensional (3-D) writing of a new generation of optical systems that is not available in conventional photonics manufacturing presently centered on fiber (1-D) or planar lightwave circuits (2-D). Our discovery of heat accumulation effects during 'burst' laser interactions has opened new directions for smoothing structures, mitigating crack formation, and annealing defects that offer a solution for reducing optical losses in laser fabricated devices. Finally, powerful ""5-D"" spectroscopic and imaging tools - now integrated with our 'burst' laser processing tool - uniquely permits us to harvest the rich spectroscopic signature of the underlying physics, evolving erratically as the laser cuts through optical materials, driving physical transformations at extreme sun-like temperatures. These innovations are at the centre of the present proposal for 'intelligent' laser processing that monitors optical devices as they take shape in real time and improves their fabrication precision, alignment, and functionality. A positive outcome of this project will be new quality control systems and practical manufacturing technology to create highly valued optical devices and systems for our Canadian partners in the optical and telecom sector.","Manufacturing processes and products","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Communications and Information"

"Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) are an attractive material for a host of fundamental and applied studies, and their chemical functionalization has become an area of great interest for applications such as the fabrication of novel composite materials and chemical sensors. The mechanisms of functionalization are an active field of research and the current literature on this topic is abundant. However, current methodology lacks control over the attachment site of the chemical functionality and, therefore, specific chemical attachment schemes required for functional devices employing SWNT have not been achieved. Additional complexity of SWNT-based devices can only be achieved by modification of the valuable strategies already reported, such that SWNT can be functionalized in a site-specific manner along the SWNT length or tip. This in turn will limit reactions and interactions to either one of those regions only and not both. The proposed research will develop a novel approach to such site-specific functionalization that combines catalyst-assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for synthesis of aligned SWNT forests over flat substrates, and the use of coating techniques to limit the functionalization of unprotected exposed regions of the aligned SWNT forests. The nanotube arrays will be directly functionalized after a protective layer has been deposited and etched along the array. Additionally, the CVD approach will allow tailoring of the nanotube diameters, and even chirality, by controlling the experimental parameters for synthesis such as feedstock composition, temperature, and catalyst composition. The final product obtained will be an extremely well designed SWNT material in which diameter, chirality, and site of the chemical functionality are well defined. In a fundamental sense, this approach will allow an enhancement of the current understanding of SWNT covalent functionalization, while in a practical sense, optimized derivatization procedures of a broad scope will be of value in the preparation of a wide range of SWNT hybrid materials. Funds requested will support 4MSC students and 3 PhD students to conduct an integrated design and experimental research program.

"The objectives of the research are to construct new types of microscopes and develop new methods of microscopy in order to make new measurements of the properties of materials. The microscopes use holography to interfere electrons, photons and acoustic beams. The material properties are being determined from the intensity and phase of beams having passed through the materials. One microscopy method, energy-filtered diffracted beam holography (DBH) is being used to measure the coherence properties of plasmons and phonons from degree of coherence and spatial coherence width measurements, which will enable researchers to understand nanoscience and to develop nanotechnology. Energy-filtered DBH should also be able to measure the coherence properties of interband charges (electrons, holes, dopants) in electronic materials and the magnetic potential and coherence of magnons in magnetic materials. A confocal holography (CH) microscope will non-intrusively measure the absolute three-dimensional temperatures, compositions, electrostatic and magnetic potentials existing in materials. Various types of CH microscopes have been designed, simulated and are now under construction. A laser CH microscope will measure temperatures and compositions in fluids and solids to help explain heat and mass transport mechanisms. An acoustic CH microscope will measure temperatures and compositions of objects representative of human tissue for medical diagnostic purposes. An electron CH microscope will measure electrostatic and magnetic potentials in materials at the nanoscale with the ultimate goal of knowing the electron density existing between the atoms.

"The objective of this research program is to exploit the unique potential of microfossils for reconstructing past environmental and evolutionary changes during major perturbations to the Earth system. The main focus is to assess the causes and consequences of periods of massive burial of marine organic carbon during the Mesozoic. These intervals, known as Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAEs), represent the main source rock of hydrocarbons that are exploited today. Central to the proposed research is the investigation of the four most prominent OAEs of the Mesozoic (Toarcian OAE and Cretaceous OAE1, 2, and 3). These events are associated with pronounced carbon isotope excursions of >1.5 per mille and elevated rates of biotic extinction and speciation indicating a broad impact on the evolution of Earth's ocean, climate, and biotic system. These OAEs will be studied in a mid- to high-latitude transect from the Canadian Western Interior Seaway (CWIS) to the Atlantic Ocean. These areas hold great potential to shed new light on the formation of OAEs because high latitude regions are so important for controlling the global ocean-atmospheric circulation system. A high resolution bio- and chemostratigraphy will be established, that allows the precise stratigraphic correlation between high and low latitudes sections, which are of utmost importance for the understanding of the processes, the timing, and the spatial extension of OAE formation. Furthermore, well established and new indicators for environmental changes (e.g., productivity) will be applied to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental conditions that led to OAEs. To develop new environmental indicators, the formation of organic rich sediments deposited in the Mediterranean Sea during the Holocene, the sapropel S1, will be analyzed. This sapropel may serve as an ideal example of how anoxic sediments have been formed and provides the potential to develop new paleontological indicators for the reconstruction of OAEs. Moreover, selected microfossil groups will be investigated to assess and quantify evolutionary changes connected with the formation of OAEs in a mid- to high latitudinal transect. This transect will allow to distinguish between evolutionary and ecological trends in microfossils through time.","Earth sciences","Solid Earth Sciences"

"Through computer simulations it is now feasible to determine the physics of the origin of the elements in the first generations of stars that formed in our Universe. All matter that we see has been formed in stars and stellar explosions, except hydrogen and most helium which  came out of the Big Bang. This stellar nuclear production started with the very first metal-free stars that had nothing but the Big Bang mix of protons and helium atoms to feed their nuclear engines. We now know both from observations and from theoretical considerations that stars in this early epoch of our Universe evolved differently than for example our sun which has significant amounts of heavier elements (which is obvious from all the matter on earth that is not hydrogen or helium). The first stars start the gradual build-up of complete distribution of elements that we observe today in the solar system, and to understand this beginning quantitatively is therefore of utmost importance if we aim to fully grasp where and how the elements originate. In order to fully understand the physics of nuclear production in these first stars we need to perform large-scale computer simulations that take into account all the relevant fundamental physical principles. In this project we will do exactly this. We develop theory and simulation based predictions of how these stars evolved, and what elements they produced in which quantities.

Astronomers will be able to compare these predictions with their observations of the oldest, and thus most metal-poor stars, as well as ponder upon questions like, where did those first stars form? and how did they end up in our galaxy? how did the galaxy form? 

This research project will enhance our insight in fundamental question about our origin in the Universe, and on the way give students the opportunity to develop cutting-edge and transferable capabilities in a fascinating field of the natural sciences and modern computer simulation.

"The long-term objective of our NSERC sponsored research is to solve the distribution problem in biomechanics. The distribution problem deals with identifying the muscular, ligamentous and bony contact forces that act in and around joints and allow us to perform a vast diversity of movements in a smooth and coordinated way. This problem is at the centre of biomechanics research as a solution would provide us simultaneously with an understanding of how human (and animal) movement is coordinated, and what forces act on the internal structures of the musculoskeletal system. The first is of utmost importance in the area of movement control and motor learning, while the latter represents a basic premise for most problems in biomechanics research. 

We have developed sophisticated tools to measure internal (muscle, tendinous and ligamentous) forces, muscle activation patterns, and internal strains directly for unrestrained movements, and furthermore are able to perform intricate assessments of the mechanical properties of musculoskeletal tissues. In this proposal, we combine this expertise to answer the following specific questions that are directly based on our previous work: (i) why are some muscles not used for specific movements when they could perfectly contribute to that movement? For example, the soleus, an ankle extensor muscle, has been thought to be always active during ankle extension, but recent results clearly demonstrate that this is not the case. (ii) Why is isometric force decreased following active muscle shortening and increased following stretch? This latter problem is not only important for understanding the mechanical properties of skeletal muscles, so that we can use them for solving the distribution problem, but it is also a problem that cannot be explained with the current paradigm of muscle contraction, the so-called cross-bridge theory. Therefore, solution of this problem might provide us with conceptual and new insight into the molecular mechanisms of muscle contraction.

"The goal of the CREATE program is to train and prepare 21st century biomedical engineers for the challenges of their academic and industrial jobs and provide them with the tools to become leaders in the field. This will be accomplished with an integrated programme crossing from the undergraduate to the postdoctoral level.

Key components of the program include experiential learning on the undergraduate level, the possibility for accelerated training from the undergraduate to the Master's degree, and multi-disciplinary training and exposure to leading national and international academic and industrial partners for trainees across all levels. Program components include three different routes on the graduate level aimed at preparing future academic, entrepreneurial or clinical leaders in the field of biomedical engineering.



The program is led by 11 world renowned scientists in the areas of musculoskeletal health, orthopaedics, cardiovascular engineering, imaging and biomedical modeling from five different faculties at the University of Calgary. The lead team has extensive experiences in technology development, collaborations with industrial and academic partners and in founding of biotechnology companies.



The training grant is supported by top priority strategic goals of the University of Calgary and associated faculties, and strategic diversification plans of the province of Alberta. It directly addresses the lack of qualified, multi-disciplinary biomedical engineers in a highly technological field that is expanding at an unprecedented rate and will require many more professionals than are presently produced in Canada.

"The purpose of this Research Tools and Instruments (RTI) Grant proposal is to obtain funding required to purchase, convert and upgrade a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system for the synthesis of novel metal chalcogenide quantum materials. The unique and exciting property of these quantum materials is the free flow of electrons across their surfaces with no loss of energy - while the bulk of the crystal remains an insulator. In the past months, theorists have predicted that several bismuth and antimony compounds behave like so-called topological insulators. First results, published in June of 2009 on bismuth telluride bulk crystals confirmed the theoretical predictions. It is now of great importance to be able to quickly grow epitaxial thin film materials with extremely high crystal quality in order to both study the properties of topological insulators in great detail and to enable applications. Particularly exciting is the prospect of being able to study an image magnetic monopole and to develop dramatically faster, almost powerless, and more efficient computer chips. MBE is the method of choice for the synthesis of tailored high-quality heterostructures that show the desired properties at room-temperature. The prime materials system of interest is the tetradymite group. Prominent examples are bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) and bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), which are group V/VI narrow bandgap semiconductors. Apart from being suitable for optical devices, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 are used as room-temperature thermoelectric materials. The MBE system to be converted was used for solid state physics research. This system is in excellent condition (the growth chamber reaches a base pressure of 1*10^{-11} Torr) and it can be easily adapted for the proposed V/VI work at minimal cost. The system is outfitted with arsenic and antimony sources, which are also needed for the proposed research (for GaAs buffer layers, As-capping and Sb-based compounds). Critical parts requested include cracker cells for selenium and tellurium, a control software upgrade, a hydrogen cleaning source, as well as analytical tools (RHEED, X-ray detector, line-of-sight mass spectrometer).

"Our research objective is to develop an improved chemical aging protocol to better predict the relative field performance of straight and modified asphalt cements. The current rolling thin film oven (RTFO) and pressure aging vessel (PAV) methods fail to create laboratory-aged samples that perform similarly to materials recovered from the field. 



The problem is best illustrated with a set of materials used in a 2003 trial on Highway 655 north of Timmins, Ontario. All materials in this trial are graded according to current standards in a narrow range between -34.6�C and -37�C. Hence, they were designed to survive and perform similarly with respect to thermal cracking during a cold spell of -34�C after 7-10 years of service. This has not happened: only two sections survived largely unscathed and the remaining five sections showed serious damage after a cold spell of -34�C in January 2004. Preliminary investigations of recovered asphalt cements from this trial have shown errors in the RTFO/PAV aging methods ranging from -2.8�C to +12�C. Such significant errors can help explain the observed variations in distress, with section 4 performing worst and section 1 performing best. 



A more realistic aging method will be developed using very thin films hardened through oxidation, volatilization and exudation in moderate temperature and pressure conditions. Accompanying nanoindentation tests, applied directly to the aged films at low and ambient temperatures, will be developed for specification grading to more accurately reflect true performance in service. Canada will benefit from this research because our roads continue to suffer from premature thermal and fatigue cracking distress. The application of these research products by user agencies will allow them to save the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.

"The short-term objective of our research will be to develop innovative additives and designs to prevent fracture in asphalt due to low temperature and fatigue distress. A secondary objective will be to develop new test methods to simulate chemical aging in service. The long-term objective will be to secure the acceptance of these improvements by government and industry to achieve a more sustainable infrastructure. Our research will focus on several new areas. Our primary interest is to design new copolymers that lower the asphalt yield stress at low temperatures. Today, no such additives exist for asphalt, although virtually all lubricants contain similar materials as pour point depressants. The imminent production of large quantities of lower-quality asphalt derived from oil sands projects means that there is a degree of urgency to this research. A second area will focus on the development of new routes to make styrene-butadiene polymers compatible in asphalt. Chemical methods will be designed to promote grafting of asphalt onto the polymer backbone rather than crosslinking the polymer, which is known to cause a deterioration of properties. A third area of our research will investigate how toughness, interfacial strength, and filler size affect the tertiary creep stage in asphalt. This deformation stage, which is predominant in old pavements, involves a fracture component. Our final area of research relates to the development of improved aging tests. Current laboratory protocols do not replicate the way in which binders chemically age in service; hence improvements are needed in these protocols. If we succeed in developing more failure-resistant asphalts the benefits to Canada are significant. With over 1.4 million two-lane equivalent kilometers of roads, current annual repair costs amount to over $10 billion. It is important that, with such an enormous investment, the full mechanical property potential (e.g., modulus, toughness, yield stress, deformation) of asphalt is better understood. Our research will continue to make important contributions toward this goal. Training obtained in my laboratory will allow students to find jobs in the asphalt materials sector or in closely related polymer, adhesives, and coatings industries.

"Antihydrogen:

The simplest antimatter atom consists of a positron (antielectron) orbiting an antiproton. It is our aim (in the context of the ATRAP collaboration led by G. Gabrielse of Harvard) to study these antimatter atoms and to determine if the properties of antihydrogen exactly mirror the properties of regular hydrogen. We have already been able to produce slow antihydrogen atoms at the CERN laboratory in Geneva using two different processes, including a dual-charge-exchange process developed at York. Our next step is to suspend them in a magnetic trap. We have made major steps towards these goals over the past five years, and expect that we will be able to trap and study antihydrogen atoms soon.

Positronic Atoms:

An exotic atom constructed of one proton, two electrons and one positron will be studied. We intend to create highly-excited (Rydberg) states of this positronic atom. The creation processes for these states is similar to the processes used for creating antihydrogen, and thus we will be able to study these processes in our laboratory at York, without need for the CERN laboratory. We also will use these exotic atoms to make very precise studies of the properties of the hydrogen minus ion and other negative ions. 

Helium Fine Structure:

We continue to make very-high-precision microwave measurements of the fine structure of helium in order to test quantum electrodynamics in this two-electron atom and to make a measurement of the fine-structure constant--the constant that determines the strength of all electromagnetic interactions. Our latest measurements use the Ramsey technique of separated oscillatory fields to achieve higher precision. In addition, a new series of measurement in the lighter helium-3 isotope will be made and used to shed light on the current discrepancy between theory and experiment for these intervals.

"The need to exploit novel ecological materials becomes essential as polymers not relying on petroleum resources are sought for, and as environmental concerns related to waste management becomes an issue. Marine by-products such as crab and shrimp shells are abandoned along the processing route. These shells consist of chitin, proteins and calcium carbonate as the main structural components, chitin being the most abundant organic material after cellulose. Chitin and its main industrial derivative, chitosan, constitute the principal biopolymers from marine feedstock available today and yet, their potential in terms of value-added products has not been exploited to fullness. Their use remains challenging to the scientific community and the industry due to a lack of understanding of the fundamental mechanisms dictating their behavior in different physical states and processes. This is mainly due to the large polydispersity in chain size and chemical composition intrinsic to natural polymers, in opposition to their synthetic counterparts.

The long term objective of this project is to develop deeper understanding of chitosan behavior in the solution and gel states, leading to tailored formulations of chitosan-based hydrogels and beads for novel food and non-food applications. We propose to take advantage of the attributes of various additives to improve the properties of chitosan gels and beads. By considering the chitosan properties such as molecular weight and degree of acetylation, the solutions properties such as pH and ionic force, and the nature of the additives, we plan to formulate a wide range of gel materials with tailored properties. Furthermore, the present proposal aims at formulating chitosan-based high value-added products with end uses that justify a higher cost.

Results form this work will greatly valorize this marine macromolecule which has been considered as a waste by the fishing industry for a long time. It should result in a significant scientific and socio-economic potential benefit to Canada. Training of researchers will provide a skilled work force that will be employable in various high technology sectors related to natural polymers.

"The construction waste management research program at the University of British Columbia - Okanagan (UBCO) is a new and emerging research and training facility. The main objective of the research program is to develop practical tools, technologies, and management solutions for Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste in construction projects, by considering the needs and expectations of the project stakeholders, environment, and general public. The most critical activity in achieving the goals of the research program is to observe current waste management practices in construction projects in all weather and site conditions without interruptions. The researchers at UBCO are currently conducting manual observations in active construction projects and landfills. They are experiencing several imitations related to weather, time, and accessibility to the work areas. 

This proposal focuses on developing a remote observation system for construction waste, which can be used in the construction project environment and landfills. The system consists of four high resolution field cameras, with zooming and panning capabilities, connected to a laboratory facility with high capacity computer stations. The transferred images from the on-site cameras will be observed in real time and archived for future use. The proposed laboratory facility consists of two high capacity computers with external hard drives and two 42"" LCD display panels. The camera network will be integrated with Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), where the field observers can upload manual observations to the system for data validations. The field observers will also be able to retrieve the camera images through PDAs to verify manual observations. The remote observation method has fewer disturbances to construction field operations and personnel; therefore more accurate data acquisition is possible. The rugged camera system can be operated in any weather and site conditions. The camera system will also be an invaluable tool in other collaborative research activities in the construction safety and productivity improvement.

"A general theme threads my research: how is our understanding of astrophysical phenomena and fundamental physics connected.  Compact objects provide a laboratory to test our knowledge of nature at the extreme.  The magnetic fields, densities and pressures of neutron stars exceed those produced on Earth more than a billion-fold. Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to extrapolate and verify our theories of matter, energy and their interaction. My research over the past few years has focused on the theoretical and observational understanding of these objects.



I propose several projects probing accreting and isolated neutron stars.  Specifically, detailed calculations of the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of neutron star crusts and the properties of atoms in strong magnetic fields will help us understand the recently discovered oscillations of the crusts of neutron stars and spectral lines from strongly magnetized neutron stars.  Simulations of high-energy processes in the magnetospheres of neutron stars will help us to understand the recently discovered (and unexpected) hard x-ray emission from magnetars and may shred interesting insights on pulsar emission.



This line of research has already led to important, surprising results such as the expectation that because of the effects of virtual particles the radiation from the surfaces of neutron stars should be strongly polarized, helping to spur the development of a Canadian x-ray polarimetry satellite at McGill, and the identification of Rossby waves in the surface layers of neutron stars.  Throughout the world high-energy astrophysics (in Canada neutron-star astrophysics in particular) lies at the forefront of astronomy in terms of achievements, funding for research and instrumentation as well as hiring of academic personnel.

"Significant gaps exist in our knowledge on mechanisms underlying larval development and metamorphosis, in many marine invertebrate phyla. My long term objective is to gain insights into the signaling architecture underlying larval development and metamorphosis with specific emphasis on thyroid hormone (TH) signaling in echinoids (sea urchins and sand dollars). Although THs are generally viewed as classic vertebrate hormones, my preliminary data strongly suggests a function in echinoid larval life histories. Furthermore, while developmental signaling molecules are generally considered to be strictly endogenously produced, my research provides evidence that THs in the marine environment have both internal and external sources. In this program I will therefore evaluate the role of both, exogenous and endogenous sources of THs in the context of marine larval life histories and their evolution. My specific aims for this 5 year granting period are to: Aim 1: Confirm presence and precise identity of TH related compounds in echinoid larvae and phytoplankton. Aim 2: Identify putative TH signaling and synthesis genes in the sea urchin S. purpuratus. Aim 3: Compare mechanisms of TH synthesis in two congeneric sand dollar species. This research will produce novel data on TH signaling in echinoid larval development and metamorphosis. More generally, it will expand our understanding of hormonal signaling systems in invertebrate phyla and elucidate their role in life history evolution.    Findings from this research program and specifically from the proposed project will elucidate 1) the extent of homoplasy (i.e. convergence, parallelism and reversal) in the mechanisms underlying the regulation of metamorphic life histories and 2) how these signaling systems may have been modified through evolution, leading to the extensive diversity of life history modes in these groups. In sum, by bridging the gap between classical larval life history and modern ontogenetic, cellular and genomic approaches, this program will exemplify the potential of multidisciplinary biological research to provide novel insights into animal development, evolution and ecology.

"The proposed research deals with the production of singlet oxygen and other derived radicals upon visible irradiation of proteins belonging to the family of the green fluorescent protein. Within this proposal, we will dedicate considerable effort to build synthetic compounds that mimic the different protein chromophores. The ability of these synthetic compounds to produce singlet oxygen will be followed and quantified in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems using state of the art spectroscopic techniques. Since these compounds are composed of well-known singlet oxygen inhibitors, a part of the proposed research will be dedicated to understanding and quantifying the interaction of singlet oxygen with the synthetic compounds mimicking the fluorescent protein chromophores. Another aspect of our work will also involve the characterization and quantification of the damage induced by singlet oxygen on the proteins themselves. Finally, the production of singlet oxygen by different proteins upon visible irradiation will be quantified and will be use to oxidize a model system (lipids) but also proteins that have received little or no attention. 



The large range of fluorescent proteins will allow us to develop a new class of photosensitizers that may find application in cells in the generation of oxidative stress with subcellular spatial resolution.

"Cryptography plays a fundamental role in providing security for computer and communication systems in a variety of applications. The objective of this research is to investigate the digital hardware design of symmetric-key encryption algorithms, such as stream ciphers and block ciphers, targeted to a range of application environments, but with a special focus on small, low power devices. These investigations will consider the resistance of the cipher designs to side-channel attacks, an increasingly important category of security vulnerabilities based on information leaked due to implementation factors.



The research will examine the following aspects of digital hardware implementation and related cryptographic theory: (1) general architectures and design techniques for low complexity and low power designs, (2) design methods to prevent or mitigate side-channel attacks, (3) modes of operation targeted to applications requiring hardware implementations of ciphers, and (4) the analysis of newly proposed ciphers with respect to side-channel attacks. The research will make extensive use of the digital hardware design tools provided by CMC Microsystems and practical realizations of designs will target field programmable gate array (FPGA) and application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) CMOS technologies. 



As an engineering research program, this work will contribute significantly to the aspects of cipher design which make practical applications secure and efficient, particularly in the increasingly important domain of small, embedded devices. It is anticipated that the research will contribute to the development of practices used for the application of security in a broad range of communication products. The training aspect of the proposal, in addition to potential intellectual property and scientific knowledge arising from the work, will contribute to the growth of the security sector in Canadian high tech industry.

"Computing infrastructure is sought to support research addressing the mining of rule sets in large network data repositories and the continuous evolution of models that provide an innovative approach to supporting this task. Specifically, the server system has the following properties:



1) Large data sets: Data sourced from network log files are generally measured in terms of terabytes to tens of terabytes. Pre-processing the data into formats appropriate for applying data mining/ machine learning paradigms generally multiplies the original size of the data set. Providing fast access to such data for the purposes of benchmarking multiple algorithms under real-world scenarios adds to the need to provide suitable computing infrastructure to support the research groups current international standing in this area. This is especially true in the case of traffic classification under encrypted protocols, where this is applicable to services with the most growth (e.g., Skype and Peer-to-peer applications).

2) Continuous coevolution: Genetic Programing (GP) is a form of Machine Learning in which genetically motivated processes for adaptation are the norm. GP provides a very effective metaphor for mining data sets care of competitive coevolution or an ""arms race"" between learners and  training scenarios. By operating under a framework of competitive coevolution, such models may operate under streaming data scenarios. Moreover, the addition of metaphors based on symbiosis provides a very effective scheme for scaling the process of model building to much larger problem domains than would otherwise be the case. This is particularly true in the case of behavioral modeling -- where this implies that feedback is not available on an instance by instance basis. Thus, much like playing chess, a definitive outcome is only available at the conclusion of the game. From a behavioral modeling perspective the availability of definitive feedback denoting an explicitly malicious behavior might only be available after a variable number of interactions with a computing system.

"Despite the large number of engineering materials, there are currently enormous gaps in material property space. This study addresses the significant need for lightweight structural metals that can withstand the high temperatures seen in aerospace and ground-based vehicle applications. Lightweight metal foams can be made by incorporating an internal void structure, providing good strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios at ultra-low density. However, these are typically made from lightweight metals such as aluminum and are unsuitable for high temperature applications. On the other hand, nickel-based superalloys have excellent high temperature stability but suffer from high density and intergranular failure mechanisms. This project will take the best of cellular materials design and the best of interfacial engineering to develop a new type of hybrid material that combines the high temperature stability of grain boundary engineered super-alloys with the lightweight structural performance of periodic cellular metals. It will enable efficiency improvements in both ground vehicle and aerospace applications by reducing component weight and allowing higher engine operating temperatures.

"The objective of this NSERC Discovery Grant is to design new types of hybrid cellular materials that can access previously unattainable regions of material property space.  This approach, in which hybrid materials are designed to target specific material property combinations, will become increasingly important given the world's growing demand for limited resources and energy.  



The first design aspect is of the internal cellular architecture.  Here we will be creating a hybrid of metal and open space in which the internal strut connectivity causes the applied stresses to be resolved axially along the constituent struts.  These micro-truss cellular architectures can be more than an order of magnitude more structurally efficient than conventional metal foams.  



The second design aspect is of the intercrystalline structure.  Here we will be manipulating the grain boundary density to produce the first nanocrystalline micro-truss materials and the grain boundary character distribution to produce the first grain boundary engineered micro-truss materials.  



This is a new approach to cellular materials design.  On the one hand we will address basic science questions concerning the interaction of architecture and microstructure, while on the other we will develop new types of materials for targeted applications.  The goal is to be able to tune the mechanical response through controlled manipulations of architecture and microstructure.  It will enable fundamental advances in Canadian manufacturing and pioneer the development of interfacially designed cellular materials.

The main focus of our research over the past five years was on ""genome dynamics"", i.e., the patterns of evolutionary change in genome structure and composition. More specifically, we surveyed the patterns of variation in the nucleotide contents of many completely sequenced genomes, and we then correlated these variations in genome composition with variations in synonymous codon usage and the amino acid composition of the corresponding proteomes. 



We also performed a series of bioinformatics analyses in order to infer the respective evolutionary effects of natural selection, mutational bias and genetic drift. Our goal was to answer, at least in part, the following question: are the variations in nucleotide content, both within and between genomes, mainly due to the effects of natural selection acting at the protein level, or are they instead due primarily to the effects of fluctuating mutational biases at the nucleotide level. Our published results, along with our current investigations indicate that the data can best be explained by a combination of both nucleotide-level mutational biases and proteome-level natural selection. Our proposed research will continue to dissect these evolutionary forces, while adding a new dimension - the effect of variations in genetic recombination rates.



This work is important because it provides a framework for evaluating the many recent reports of selection in the human genome, and in other genomes. These reports, which are generally based on comparative sequence data, often ignore many of the factors that can influence genome evolution in the absence of positive Darwinian selection (for a recent review, see Nielsen et al., 2007).

"New mineral occurrences at the earth's surface are rare. Future discoveries will depend on subsurface exploration and this requires the far-field detection of such ore deposits. Sedimentary rocks are important hosts for world-class deposits of Au, Pb, Zn & Cu in Canada and the world. They form at <4-6 km depth from the upwelling of hot fluids derived from hotter levels of the crust. Defining the far-field expression of these systems is challenging owing to their low temperature (<200-250 C) and subtle, spatially restricted and poorly constrained, alteration halos.

This project uses an integrated set of analytical techniques to derive a model of the thermo-chemical expression of hydrothermal fluid flow in sedimentary rock-hosted Au-deposits. Specifically we will apply detailed and geologically constrained geochemistry, mineral alteration, and stable isotope studies (H, O & C), with low temperature thermochronology (apatite fission-track, apatite & zircon (U-Th)/He). The former techniques provide chemical information that tracks the passage of the mineralizing fluids through the rocks. The low-temperature thermochronology provides a means to track the thermal effect of the hydrothermal fluids as they pass through the rocks. Together, these two approaches will enable us to understand the spatial-thermal-chemical evolution of sedimentary rock-hosted systems in a way not previously possible.

Having built such a model of the proximal to distal expression of such, we will develop a cost-effective

sampling and analysis strategy using the best combination of thermochronology, thermometry and geochemical

/ mineralogical tracers to provide reliable far-field vectors toward ore.

We will focus our study on Carlin-type sedimentary rock-hosted Au-deposits in Nevada; the third highest

Au-producing area in the world.

"This proposal comprises three distinct but complementary themes focused on improving our understanding of the processes that control the distribution of  mineral deposits in the Earth's crust:

a) Thermal evolution of hydrothermal ore systems:  Advective transfer of heat accompanies the hydrothermal fluid flow responsible for development of many of the world's mineral deposits. We will map the spatial and temporal pattern of heat transfer associated with such hydrothermal systems using a combination of thermochronology and thermometry. This data will be combined with numerical modeling to build a framework for understanding the thermal evolution of these systems. 

b) Paleogeographic and tectonic controls on the spatio-temporal patterns of fluid flow and ore-genesis:  Many base metal sedimentary-rock hosted mineral deposits exhibit a clear spatial and temporal relationship to the paleogeography and tectonic environment of the basin they formed in. We will study these relationships for a sedimentary rock hosted Cu-system in northern Canada to better define the genetic connection between basin architecture and hydrothermal fluid flow.

c) Toward a more objective analysis of ore textures:  The final research theme links structurally focused geological mapping and textural/microstructural analysis with modern micro-analytical and crystallographic imaging techniques to assess the extent to which sulfide mineral textures are reliable discriminators of primary or secondary ore formating processes.

"River ice jam floods present significant threats to human life and property, because of the speed with which they can occur.  We have measured water level rises approaching 1m per minute in our field studies during ice jam release events, and the flood levels associated with ice jam formation events frequently exceed summer flood levels in many communities across Canada. The fact that ice jams cause such dramatic water level rises, along with the congestion of river channels with massive amounts of ice, make them difficult to predict and extremely challenging to measure.  However, after more than a decade of focused research, my students and I have succeeded in developing techniques for predicting and measuring ice jam formation and release events, both in the lab and in the field.  This knowledge has formed the basis of our numerical models of ice jam floods, and has provided valuable validation data for our own, and others', models as well.  



The research field of ice jam dynamics is still in its infancy, in comparison to open channel hydraulics, and much research yet needs to be done if we are to be able to reliably forecast the floods associated with ice jam events, and to design river engineering structures (like bridges) to withstand them.  Furthermore, knowledge of ice jam dynamics is needed to predict the effects of wave releases from hydro-power dams, since uncontrolled hydro-power production in winter can result in severe ice jam floods. 



The objective of the proposed research program is to make significant contributions to our understanding of the dynamics of ice jam formation and release, in response to these pressing research needs.

"Each year during the spring, river breakup brings the threat of ice jam floods to many of the communities

across Canada which are situated around rivers. Breakup ice jams occur when snowmelt swells the stream, and

lifts and breaks the ice cover suddenly. The ice pieces may initially be carried along with the snowmelt flow,

but often become congested - perhaps at a bridge, at a tight bend in the river, or in amongst islands - and when

this happens an ice jam is formed. The streamflow is blocked by this dam of ice, and water levels can rise at

rates approaching two to three feet per minute, with virtually no advance warning. As a result, damages from

ice jam floods are usually extreme - averaging about $60M per year in Canada alone (in 1995 dollars).

The speed and scale of this fast rising water presents a very real threat to human safety as well, and this threat

can be expected to increase as our communities continue to grow and population density increases. If we are to

ensure safe and expedient evacuations from areas threatened by ice jam floods, then sufficient advanced

warning must be provided. Quite simply we do not yet have this warning capability for ice jam floods, and this

inadequacy in our flood forecasting systems results in the unnecessary threat of death each time an ice jam

occurs and untold stress to victims of ice jam floods.

To ensure the safety and security of people and property in the hundreds of communities across Canada that are

threatened by ice jams each spring, practical and reliable river ice jam flood forecasting tools are needed.

These must provide advance warning of the expected severity, timing, and magnitude of ice jam floods. In

addition, to ensure they are of practical value, the resulting flood forecasting system must be useable by local

Emergency Operations personnel, requiring no specialized knowledge of river ice dynamics. This research

project is aimed at developing this capability.","Inland waters","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Safety and Security"

    The Town of Hay River, situated on the south shore of Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories, is one such community; ice jams form there every spring.  The most extreme flood in recent decades occurred in 1963.  Local resident Roy Fabian (Chief of the K�tl`odeeche First Nation in 2005/06) was a boy at the time of the flood, and recounted for us a terrifying story of being rescued by boat from the second story window of his home.  They paddled furiously towards the bush, and as he looked back, he saw a wall of water surging from the channel.  He could not see 30 foot high trees on the opposite river bank - the ice had piled so high.  More recently, severe flooding occurred in 2003, and minor flooding twice since then.



To ensure the safety and security of people and property in the many communities across Canada that are threatened by ice jams each spring, practical and reliable river ice jam flood forecasting tools are needed.  To develop such models we need to study ice jam behaviour, both to understand its complexities, and to have the needed data to test our models.  With its propensity for ice jam occurrence, and its need for flood warning systems, Hay River represents an ideal location for such scientific studies.

"Whereas many important physical and chemical properties of transition metal complexes stem from metal-centered redox activity/chemistry, coordinated ligands may also be active electron-transfer participants.  Complexes of so-called redox active ligands (RALs) have been known for over 40 years but research on RAL complexes has been limited in scope and focused heavily on electronic structure elucidation. But in the past few years new kinds of RALs have been discovered and there have been reports of novel reactivity/catalysis using RAL complexes.

Much of the current and future activity worldwide in RAL complex chemistry will likely exploit the more well-known RALs such as dithiolenes, quinones, and phenoxyls. But at this early stage of development it is worth exploring the potential offered by less conventional RALs.   The central thrust of this proposal is the study and development of RAL complexes, with a particular focus on verdazyl radicals as the RAL. As stable radicals, verdazyls have been explored as components of magnetic materials but their redox activity has not been studied prior to some recent work from my group. A broad range of fundamental studies are proposed along with more targeted work with potential applications in catalysis, advanced materials, and energy research.

These telescopes, now being designed by astronomers and engineers worldwide, will achieve their power by a combination of large aperture and advanced technologies. One of these technologies, adaptive optics, is key to all future large ground-based telescopes because it can largely correct for the blurring effect of turbulence in the atmosphere. Next-generation AO systems will require high-powered lasers and sophisticated computer-controlled deformable mirrors. The lasers are used to illuminate sodium atoms, deposited by meteors in the upper atmosphere, in order to produce artificial ""reference stars"". The light from these sodium ""stars"" is needed to measure, and then correct for, the turbulence. To design these systems, we must first understand the structure of Earth's sodium layer. By combining a 6-metre liquid-mirror telescope with a sophisticated laser and detector system, my team has developed a sodium lidar (laser radar) that produces data of unsurpassed quality. My students and I will use this facility to study and better understand the structure and dynamics of this important region of the atmosphere, and provide knowledge essential for the development of extremely large telescopes. 



The Canadian arctic holds much promise as a location for future telescopes. This mountainous region is high and dry, has relatively little cloud cover, and could potentially have superb seeing conditions. My research group is developing a unique instrument, an Arctic Turbulence Profiler, that will be able to measure the strength and distribution of atmospheric turbulence. From this we can determine the seeing, at any height above the ground and thereby determine the quality of the site. We plan to deploy this instrument at a mountain site in northern Ellesmere Island and operate it throughout the winter months. If the results are as promising as we anticipate, this could lead to a Canadian telescope at possibly the best astronomical site in the world.

The process by which a detonation sweeps through these reactive materials (detonation waves) will be studied in this program.

The approach taken in this program is to study simpler, model systems both in the lab and in computer-based models.  The insight obtained may permit more accurate safety assessments of explosives.

"The ability of animals to accurately detect and respond to stimuli in their natural environment typically depends on integration of inputs from many different sensory systems.  Despite this reliance on multiple sensory inputs much of what we know about sensory function is based on studies of sensory systems in isolation.  We know much less about how animals actually integrate information to obtain an overall picture of their external environment.  The proposed research will attempt to address this inequity by examining responses of fish first to auditory stimuli and then to stimuli from other systems to see how other systems interact with hearing.  This will first be conducted in the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), a highly invasive fish in Canada.  We will test responses of gobies using behavioural and physiological approaches to ascertain how the brain processes information from many sensory channels and how this processing affects the ability of the goby to respond to the stimulus.  We will then assess how these multisensory responses change as gobies mature into reproductive adults to understand how hormones can remodel sensory systems and brain areas.  Assessment of these responses in the round goby will be interesting in its own right, explaining how vertebrates process multiple types of information, but will also be useful in designing mitigation strategies for this invasive species.  Upon successful completion of the work in the goby we will then ask similar questions in two other fish species to determine the generality of our observed responses.

"    )	We have come to take for granted the idea that organisms possess genomes. A huge scientific effort has been put into the sequencing the genomes of human and many other species. The field of genomics is the study of organisms at the level of whole sets of interacting genes and proteins. A cell is envisaged as a complex system in which chemical reactions happen, molecules are broken down and resynthesized, cellular components move about actively and passively, and structures assemble and disassemble. As a result, a cell lives, grows and multiplies. In contrast, the genome is somehow special. It remains in charge of the proceedings without doing anything directly. It is the molecular elite, attended to by a variety of other molecules designed to keep it undamaged and to allow it to be accurately passed on to the next generation with nothing but a few minor mutations here or there. How did the genome rise to this supreme position? 

    )	In this proposal, I want to ask how cells came to have genomes in the first place, and to consider how the genomes of current organisms evolved to be the way they are. I will consider three key stages of evolution that correspond to increasing levels of complexity of the genome.

(a) At the stage of chemical evolution, assemblies of molecules may have formed metabolic reaction networks that could grow and evolve without a genome at all. I will develop theories and computer simulations to show how such networks could have worked.

(b) At the RNA world stage, RNA sequences acted both as genes and catalysts. I want to understand how cells progressed from being bags of separate genes to organisms with large integrated genomes. 

(c) Translation is the process of making a protein using the information stored in a gene sequence. After translation evolved, protein sequences could be coded in the genome and organisms could begin to make use of the tremendous functional versatility offered by proteins. I wish to understand how the set of rules for translation between RNA and proteins evolved (this is known as the genetic code).

"My research aims for correct, robust and efficient solutions to problems that arise from systems that use many processing components simultaneously.  

     Asynchronous shared memory architectures use elaborate hardware and software to speed computation.  Message-passing architectures are similarly complicated by a variety of message delivery services, which provide differing constraints on message ordering.  These mechanisms cause subtle, unexpected behaviour that can differ dramatically from what algorithm designers expect.  Thus, without using synchronization primitives, ""natural"" solutions to ""simple"" problems are not correct.  The catch is: the elaborate speed-enhancing mechanisms complicate the programming task to such a degree that programmers add excessive synchronization, which, in turn, slows down computation.  Thus, the speed-up advantages intended by special components can be entirely defeated!  A major focus of my research is to construct algorithms that are correct given only the weak guarantees that come with these systems, and that still exploit their speed.  

     An exciting application of my research is to the new and emerging multi- and many-core computers.  Even commodity desktop and laptop computers these days have ""dual cores"".  The near horizon promises ""many-core"" architectures that place possibly hundreds of different processing units on one chip.  Scientists' knowledge of how to program these machines correctly while exploiting their available concurrency is far behind their knowledge of how to build them.  My research aims to define the behaviour of these machines so that they are easier to program.

     Even when individual components are very reliable, a failure somewhere in a large system is likely because there are so many components.  A related goal of my research is to design programs that continue to operate well in spite of some dead components, or that can automatically return our systems to correct behaviour after a burst of temporary faults.

"Quantun nano-electronics:



Single electron transistors and quantum phase interference devices are well understood and have given rise to new commercial devices based on the quantum nature of the current carriers and can be considered the building elements of quantum electronics as opposed to classical electronics, where the current is described as a continuous variable. These quantum devices typically work at low temperatures, though with the development of new devices based on high temperature superconductors or small quantum dots, some of these devices can be operated at substantially higher temperatures. In general, the crucial step for progress is not only the further miniaturization of the systems but the combination of small with quantum, i.e.,  quantum nano-electronics. This is the focus of this proposal, in which we propose to set important milestones in this area by pursuing an aggressive research agenda along the following two directions:



I) High mobility and high frequency quantum electronics



II) Quantum nano-sensors and quantum detectors



A large part of the research effort will be based on novel electronic systems such as graphene.

"My research program is focused on the membrane protein complexes of the respiratory electron transfer chain, and the accessory proteins that assist in the assembly of these complexes. Our present focus is on the enzyme complexes of the cytochrome oxidase family. We are interested in aspects of the cytochrome oxidase mechanism that results in the consumption of oxygen and storage of the resulting free energy that can be used for other cellular work. There are accessory proteins that help to construct proteins such as the cytochrome oxidase complex. Cytochrome oxidase consists of up to 13 protein subunits and these subunits have associated with them two iron ions and three copper ions. The metal ions play a direct role in the reactions catalyzed by cytochrome oxidase. In such metalloproteins the properties of the metal ions are modulated by the protein matrix and our approach to understand this subtle interplay begins with the purified protein. We use the purified oxidase to look at aspects of its reaction with oxygen, reductants and how these reactions are modulated by the interactions with membrane lipids. We are also exploring how the metal centers of the oxidase are assembled, and the protein molecules that are involved in this process. Each of our projects on the oxidase directly, or on the accessory proteins involved in its assembly begins with the purification of the protein from its biological source. These purifications involve a series of controlled steps that take place over 1-2 days, or up to one week in time. Our work relies heavily on the preparation of these proteins in large amounts in a highly purified state. Such demands require careful and controlled conditions to achieve reproducible, highly purified products in high yield. This outcome is most readily achieved through use of an automated chromatography system that affords the user a high degree of control over the purification process. The equipment requested here will allow personnel in my group to obtain the highly purified proteins that are a prerequisite for their detailed studies. In addition the use of the requested equipment supplies valuable training experience for technicians, undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of biochemistry and biophysics.

"Living organisms extract energy from food in a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The largest contributor to energy capture in higher organisms is a series of enzymes found in the mitochondrial organelle and referred to as the respiratory chain. The respiratory chain passes electrons from reduced substrates to oxygen. During this controlled burn some energy is captured and some is released as heat. The energy captured, initially as an electrical and chemical gradient formed across the mitochondrial membrane, is spent to make adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the molecule of energy exchange in biology and is used to fuel such processes as cell movement, intercellular communication and nutrient uptake. 

Cytochrome oxidase is an enzyme of the respiratory chain in organisms that burn oxygen and is the major focus of the research in this application. Electron and proton transfer are the fundamental steps that comprise the catalytic process. We are studying physical details of electron and proton transfer catalyzed by cytochrome oxidase, and how they are coupled together to conserve energy. In addition we are interested in the process of cytochrome oxidase assembly. Bacterial cytochrome oxidase is composed of four protein subunits together with a set of five redox-active metal ions. Assembly of this complex involves many accessory proteins. One of these accessory proteins (i.e., SCO) is proposed to deliver copper to cytochrome oxidase. Copper delivery not only requires that SCO exhibit selective, high affinity metal binding, but also SCO must release bound copper to a specific site within the cytochrome oxidase assembly complex. Therefore, a further objective of our research is a detailed physical characterization of the metal binding properties of SCO and its interactions with cytochrome oxidase.

An intimate component of this program is the training of undergraduate students, technicians, graduate students and post-doctoral persons in biochemical skills including membrane protein chemistry, molecular biology and biophysical methods, and to place their results in the context of cellular function.

"Renewable energy and improvement of the environment have been the focus of all research projects carried out by Drs. Hill, Nemati and Niu (and their research personnel) over the past several decades.  Current renewable energy research topics include the production of ethanol from ligno-cellulosic sugars as a renewable source of liquid fuel.  The world demand for liquid fuel is outstripping supplies, and the use of waste biomass will contribute significantly to solving this deficit in the future.  Although the hexose sugars from cellulose and hemi-cellulose can be readily converted to ethanol, more work needs to be done to turn pentose sugars into ethanol.  Another important topic is to clean petroleum contaminated waters, soils and gases using inexpensive microbial or biological technologies.  Research projects include developing novel bioreactors to achieve these goals.  Each investigation by a graduate student or summer research student requires hundreds of measurements to quantify the production of ethanol, use of sugars and disappearance of toxic chemicals.

     This proposal involves the purchase of an HPLC with two types of detectors that can quickly measure sugars and organic chemicals in water solutions.  This machines is needed to gather data to characterize the ability of our new bioreactors to produce inexpensive ethanol from waste biomass; or to remove toxic chemicals from industrial wastewater, soils and gas effluents.

"Renewable energy sources continue to be of great interest around the World due to the rising demand for energy and difficulties obtaining non-renewable supplies; as well as the desire to lessen the impact of energy consumption on the environment. Biofuels, primarily bioethanol produced by fermentation of sugars and starches, have become a large supplier of liquid fuel in both South and North America, with the United States currently producing the largest quantities, 20 billion litres/yr. Canada has a target of 1.4 billion litres/yr by the Year 2010 with major facilities recently inplace or currently under construction in several provinces. The supporting organization for this biofuel investigation, North West Bio-Energy Limited, represents one such facility under development in Saskatchewan. In this study, the fermentation process to produce bioethanol will be coupled to a photosynthetic culture to produce biodiesel or starch. The coupling of these two processes will represent a Microbial Fuel Cell with a cationic membrane separating the two culture media. The growth activities of the two microbial cultures will generate a flow of electricity as a secondary energy source; while the production of photosynthetic algae will produce biodiesel or starch as the third renewable energy source. The carbon dioxide released by the bioethanol culture will be consumed by the biodiesel culture, resulting in a carbon dioxide neutral system. Studies will be aimed at optimizing total energy production (bioethanol, biodiesel, starch and electricity) by varying algae cell type, algae growth conditions (pH, light), electrode surface area, electrode construction material and design of a novel photosynthesis bioreactor. This study will train eight students in the growing area of renewable energy systems ... biofuel production and microbial fuel cell design.

"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) include industrial chemicals such as benzene, xylene, toluene and formaldehyde.  People who suffer from respiratory ailments, such as asthma, and the very young or elderly are most likely to be adversely affected by high levels of VOCs in the air.

"Sustainable, renewable energy production has become one of the most pressing issues in science, politics and society.  Disappearing polar ice caps, record world oil prices, soaring gasoline prices and instabilities in natural gas supplies in Eastern Europe only underscore the need for sustainable, carbon-neutral, secure sources of energy.  Further complicating the situation, most commercial products, such as silicon solar cells, and near-commercial technologies, such as fuel cells and dye-sensitized solar cells, are either far too energy intensive in their production or utilize scarce precious metals, such as platinum, as electrode catalysts.  Both raise questions concerning the viability and sustainability of the present incarnations of the technologies. Top researchers throughout the world are promoting the concept of energy harvesting technologies that use only earth-abundant materials.

     The goal of the proposed research is to develop materials systems and device structures for photovoltaic energy production using commonly available, low-cost materials which are compatible with low-temperature, thereby energy conserving, sustainable manufacturing techniques.  The applicant's long-term and current research in organic electronic materials and devices, including photovoltaic applications, and recent efforts in the fields of transparent inorganic metal oxide semiconductors, dye-sensitized solar cells and growth of multi-walled carbon nanotubes on electrode surfaces has created a unique opportunity, where these areas of expertise can be combined to yield new, potentially ground-breaking approaches to solar energy conversion.Two parallel approaches to advance the state of the art in thin-film photovoltaic materials and technologies are proposed:  p-i-n doped organic solar cells to greatly enhance charge separation and decrease internal resistive losses, and the development of new hybrid organic/inorganic solar cells using high electron mobility, wide bandgap binary metal oxide semiconductors as the electron acceptor and transport layer.

"Bacteria in nature rarely live in pure culture; rather, they form complex communities that have profound effects on our world.  For example, the numbers and types of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in soil can affect the quality of a crop, and the disruption of bacterial populations in the human intestine with antibiotics can lead to life-threatening infections. Since most bacteria cannot be cultivated in the lab, our knowledge of natural microbial communities is largely based on analysis of sequences of universally conserved genes found in all bacteria.  At the same time, studies of culturable bacteria have revealed significant gene content differences between strains of bacteria that would be considered members of the same species if only universal gene sequence data were considered.  There are clues in the results of sequence-based studies of microbial communities that the significance of genomic diversity in natural communities has been underestimated.  Perturbation of microbial communities may select for strain-specific genes and result in biologically significant population shifts at the ""sub-species"" level that would be undetected by universal gene sequence-based approaches.  An inventory of genomic diversity in a microbial community is an essential first step to understanding population dynamics at the strain level. 

   My laboratory will use conventional microbiology and molecular methods to characterize sub-species genomic diversity and population dynamics in the pig intestine. The pig intestinal microbial community is significant from the perspective of livestock management, animal and human health and welfare and offers a powerful model for studying microbial community dynamics.  Our goal is to observe, predict and modify the effects of environmental variables and perturbation on intestinal microbial diversity.

   The results of this work will contribute to our long-term goals of understanding the fundamental molecular genetic processes that shape bacterial genome diversity and how environmental and biological factors both affect are affected by microbial population dynamics.

"Gasification is one process in which the wastes from the vast natural resources of Canada can be effectively utilized to provide energy in a sustainable fashion. These wastes include woody biomass derived from pine-beetle kill, construction waste, and petroleum coke (a byproduct of the oil industry). Some of these wastes contain natural catalysts (substances that affect the rate of a reaction) that can enhance the gasification of the other wastes. For example, wood contains potassium that is a well known catalyst for the gasification of coal. In this project, three research groups from the Universities of British Columbia, Calgary and Toronto will work together to better understand the benefits and challenges of co-feeding woody biomass feedstocks with other feedstocks (petroleum coke, construction waste, and low-bituminous coal) in gasification processes. More specifically, the project will involve complete feedstock characterization combined with experiments to elucidate the rate of species transfer, the effectiveness of water contained in the feedstocks compared to externally-supplied water, and the gasification performance of single and mixed feedstocks in high-pressure thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) units and a bench-scale gasifier. The knowledge gained from these studies will be combined to optimize the operation of a pilot-scale gasification unit, which will then be modeled with a kinetically-modified Gibbs Reactor Model.

"A commercially available electroacoustic particle analyzer will be adopted to characterize the microstructure of a novel class of hydrogels termed hydrogel-colloid composites. Such instruments are routinely used to apply a high-frequency oscillatory electric field to a colloidal dispersion and sense the resulting pressure fluctuations. This response accesses the colloidal stability of optically opaque (dense) fluids, such a paints, foods, and cosmetics, by furnishing the so-called zeta-potential, which is a measure of particle charge. In this research, however, the instrument will be used as an innovative, non-invasive, quantitative tool for probing the mechanical and electrical characteristics hydrogel-colloid composites. This is a rapidly emerging class of nanocomposites with widespread applications as responsive biomaterials and sensors, for example. We have recently published theoretical predictions linking the elastroscoustic signal to important microstructural characteristics, such as the particle and hydrogel charge, and viscoelasticity. Accordingly, the instrument will allow us to test the theory and, thus, pave the way toward widespread use of electroacoustic technologies for microrheological analysis.","Materials sciences","Materials and Chemical Engineering"
"My research program has recently made several important contributions to understanding complex transport processes that take place in polymeric composites. Firstly, for hydrogel composites (where charged colloidal particulates are immobilized in uncharged hydrogel matrices), we have established a rigorous theoretical foundation for advancing novel diagnostic techniques that may, in the longer term, sense biomolecular reactions in hydrogel composites, monitor cell metabolism in immobilized tissue cultures, and facilitate the early detection of breast cancer. In this work, we will develop model experimental systems to demonstrate quantitative links between laboratory measurements and physicochemical characteristics of the nanocomposite microstructure. Secondly, for polymeric nanocomposites (where nanoparticulates are dispersed in polymer melts and glasses), we developed an original theory that successfully quantifies how impenetrable nanoparticles unexpectedly enhance the permeability and reverse selectivity of glassy membranes used for gas separations. To predict membrane performance under industrially relevant conditions, we will extend the present theory to compute nanoparticle clustering, which, in turn, will be used to predict membrane permeability and selectivity at high particle loadings. My research program has also successfully applied electro-kinetic theory to develop hypotheses concerning the dynamics and organization of polymers grafted to the surfaces of phospholipid membranes. Because the polymer dynamics play an important role in laboratory diagnostics, and influence the stability and effectiveness of liposomal drug formulations, we will experimentally test our hypotheses by directly imaging polymer-derivatized phospholipids while under the influence of electrical and hydrodynamic shear forces. Finally, we will develop a theory to elucidate the propensity of polymeric nano-tubes to spontaneously buckle and fold. This research will couple theory and micro-mechanical testing, using a sophisticated optical tweezers apparatus my group has recently built, to devise practical strategies for controlling the synthesis and assembly of nanotubes for biosensing and nanofiltration applications.

"Environmental stress has a profound influence on plant growth and development. Crop production in the harsh Canadian climate is a constant challenge, with producers facing potential yield losses at all plant growth stages. Research in this program is designed to understand how plants deal with environmental stress, with the ultimate goal of improving crop performance during exposure to stress. The program focuses on two water-related stresses, flooding and desiccation.

    Flooding 'drowns' roots; that is the roots suffer from oxygen deprivation, referred to as anoxia. Our previous research has shown that a plant hemoglobin is formed during anoxia that improves the survival of flooded plant tissues. We have shown that nitric oxide (NO) is formed by mitochondria from nitrite during anoxia and that the process generates a chemiosmotic potential sufficient to drive limited ATP synthesis. The NO formed is oxygenated by hemoglobin to be recycled through the mitochondria for more ATP synthesis. In the process NAD(P)H is oxidized, further enhancing turnover of carbohydrate. The net result is improved redox and energy status resulting in cell survival during anoxia. In this proposal, we intend to further study the effect of hemoglobin expression on plant metabolism during anoxia, with emphasis on nitrate and organic acid metabolism. We will also examine the relationship between hemoglobin and aerenchyma formation.

    Seeds are exposed to severe desiccation during late embryogenesis, undergoing 

changes that ensure the survival of the quiescent or dormant embryo. This process of adaptation has been chosen as a model system to examine how plants adapt to severe water loss. We have identified several genes in barley caryopses that respond to abscisic acid (ABA) and influence embryo germination such that germination can be halted or enhanced by changing expression of these genes. Some of these genes are known to affect other reproductive processes. In the present proposal, we will determine how these genes perform their function and where they act in the pathways regulating germination and dormancy.

"The principal aim of the proposed research program is to discover, characterise and understand novel electronic and magnetic phases in exotic materials.  This is achieved using measurements of fundamental physical properties down to ultra-low temperatures and in high magnetic fields.  The materials to be explored include exotic superconductors (other than high-temperature cuprate superconductors), materials whose properties are governed by quantum critical phenomena, and geometrically frustrated magnetic systems.  



This experimental research program will be centered around an ultra-low temperature cryomagnetic system installed at the University of Waterloo that can reach temperatures as low as 0.01 K, and magnetic fields as high as 16 T.  It will consist of measurements of thermal conductivity, and also thermal expansion and magnetostriction using capacitive dilatometry.  By performing all measurements  to such low temperatures and high magnetic fields, we gain access to the true quantum mechanical ground state of the systems of interest.   Furthermore, in-situ rotation of samples with respect to the magnetic field direction will provide unique insight into the anisotropy and symmetry of the electronic and magnetic phases under study.  The use of dilatometry at ultra-low temperatures and high fields to probe novel electronic phases and quantum criticality at ultra-low temperatures is unique in Canada and possibly worldwide.



Basic research such as this is important because it underpins all technology-related disciplines:  if we are to fully harness electrons and their collective quantum behaviour to our technological advantage, then our fundamental understanding of such phenomena needs to be complete.  At present it is demonstrably not, and this research is intended to feed into the national and international knowledge-base in order to satisfy this need.

"The present proposal aims at contributing to research fields pertaining to major Earth system science issues: the dynamics of climate, sea-level changes and biogeochemical cycles, all having impact on society's security and welfare. Stable, radioactive and radiogenic isotopes constitute primary tools for the planned studies. They provide access to geological time and to a large array of physical parameters of the Earth system, thus to pre-instrumental and ""pre antropogenically-modified"" states of this system, hence to the deciphering of natural mechanisms driving the evolution of the Earth, at time scale varying from million years ago, to the present.

In support of climate change modeling, the research seeks to unravel why and how some boundary conditions may drastically modify the climate/ocean system. Instabilities in the Arctic/North Atlantic oceanic circulation represent a critical example. In this context, efforts are made to document the properties of this circulation during warm episodes of the recent geological past of the Earth, when ice-free conditions prevailed, at least seasonally, in the Arctic, and when continental ice was significantly reduced over Greenland and Arctic Canada. In parallel, it is intended to examine external vs. internal processes of the Earth that could explain why and how the natural control of climate shows departure from Milankovitch's theory at sub-millennial time scales, or how they can influence long-term sea-level changes in the amphi-Atlantic. Investigations on isotope cycling and radiometric dating will also be critical i) to monitoring the evolution/response of river systems in eastern Canada to natural vs. anthropogenic climate forcings, ii) to documenting radionuclide mobility at the hydrosphere/lithosphere interface, with application to soil erosion, or nuclear waste storage problems.

These research projects are linked to national and international research programs, such as the Canadian Polar Climate Stability Network (PCS-N), the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), and the Large River Basin program of the International Atomic Agency of Vienna (IAEA).

The confocal microscope equipped with a series of scanning lasers allows for multiple records of colors at the same time and is able to section a specimen (e.g. a cell) optically without significantly damaging the specimen. Therefore, 4-D images (XYZ + time) could be subsequently reconstructed so that interested details and their relationship could be localized. 



Upgrading this device will provide benefits for a number of research programs, encompassing neurophysiology and associated anatomy, peptide expression, drug activity and developmental science.  This will enable viewing of selectively stained tissues and structures with fluorescently-tagged antibody stains, mass filling or selective tracing of cellular structures with dye-based tracers.  Such images are important in studies of development, cellular anatomy or neuroscience, enabling visualization of structural relationships in multiple XYZ planes.

"Comparative physiology and morphology of the moth olfactory pathway



The structure and functional similarity of insect antennal lobes to vertebrate olfactory bulbs provides an attractive model to observe chemosensory processing within a relatively simpler system.  Insect behaviour is strongly linked to neurophysiology, such that reliable relationships may be inferred from a combined behavioral - neurophysiological approach.  My research program is focused on understanding the mechanisms by which odorants are encoded within the brain.  Moreover, knowledge of host odor processing and insect behavior from my lab will be used to investigate olfactory preference by insects, and to address long-standing ecological theories on host choice, chemical legacy, and mechanisms of odor memory.  As well, the olfactory system provides a model for a simple neural network which is easily accessed and manipulated to investigate signal integration, synergy and inhibition of neural signals. 



The objectives of this project are to determine how different mixtures of odorants are coded within the brain of a model moth species and determine the degree of variation in physiology, coding, and morphology between divergent moth species.  My students and I will use a combination of electrode-recording and anatomical stains of the moth antennal lobes to examine how host-plant odours and pheromones are encoded by the insect brain. Phylogeny (evolutionary lineage) and habitat (plant preference) are expected to influence representation of odours within the brain of different species.  All insects selected for investigation are economically important pest species in agriculture and forestry, and are considered some of the most damaging forest pest in the world, defoliating millions of hectares of forest every year.   Advances in the understanding of host location in all of these species will be extremely beneficial to future pest management, in Canada and globally.

"Pacific salmon support the most valuable commercial and recreational fisheries in western Canada generating over $1 billion of revenue annually. They are an important component of the food chain, are integral to mythology, spiritual integrity, and local economies of Pacific coast First Nations, and are icons for the general public, with abundant salmon confirming healthy and pristine environments. Most stocks of Pacific salmon now encounter warmer rivers during their up-river spawning migration than in any time since records were kept. The Fraser River is Canada's most productive salmon system and has experienced in the past 10 years eight of the hottest summer water temperatures on record, and climate models predict even warmer temperatures in the near future. Associated with these high temperatures have been high levels of migration mortality costing the fishery significantly with millions offish disappearing during migrations or dying unspawned. This phenomenon constitutes a severe conservation risk and puts the sustainability of Fraser sockeye in doubt. New policies have shifted sockeye salmon harvesting from cool ocean to warm river locations which puts salmon in double jeopardy if they escape or are released from capture because struggling under high temperatures can lead to mortality hours after release. We will conduct experiments to establish criteria which can predict mortality rates from expected thermal exposure and interactions with different levels of non-retention in-river fishing, and to assess effects of adult migratory thermal exposure on eggs and offspring. Our findings will provide important information that will be used to help the fisheries management agencies, our partners in this project, with their task of predicting migration mortality, predicting future stock sizes, and managing habitat to conserve the resource.","Commercial fisheries","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Environment"

"The objective of the project ""Potential antimicrobial proteins for human health - Value added products from eggshell waste"", which is targeted to the Quality Foods and Novel Bioproducts strategic grant program (Functional Foods and Neutraceuticals) is to build upon our recent research which has identified an antimicrobial protein associated with the egg. Working closely with an Ontario egg producer / breaker operation (Burnbrae Farms Ltd) and a major Canadian industrial concern in this sector, Inovatech Egg Products Inc, we will purify antimicrobial proteins from industrial eggshell breaker waste material and study their antimicrobial properties, mechanism of action and ability to protect mice against oral pathogen challenge. Potential for allergic elements in the purified material will be identified with a view to its elimination. Furthermore, in collaboration with Shaver Poultry Breeding Farms (ISA North America), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) will be identified that have potential for gene selection of breeding hens to produce eggs with enhanced antimicrobial protection. 



      The research collaboration of two active Canadian biomedical scientists will be supported in an international collaboration. This application will support multidisciplinary early-stage collaborative research that will generate new knowledge / technology and train students, with the strong potential to strengthen Canada's industrial base, generate wealth and create employment in the egg producing industry.","Animal production and animal primary products","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Food and Bioproducts"
"The protein components of biominerals (matrix proteins) influence the shape and strength of the final structure by modulating crystal nucleation and growth, which in turn defines the textural properties and crystal shape that strongly affect mechanical performance. However, the specific mechanisms through which this regulation is exercised remain unclear. My research program utilizes a novel model system to investigate how proteins influence calcification. The avian eggshell is one of the fastest calcifying processes known; 6 g of mineral is deposited in less than 20 hr during the daily formation of the chicken egg. This calcitic bioceramic is formed in the acellular uterine fluid, a milieu in which the ionic and protein composition varies during the initiation, rapid calcification and termination phases of mineral deposition. The integrity of this process is vital for the propagation of all avian species, since the eggshell is a physical and microbial barrier against the external environment in addition to regulating diffusion of water and metabolic gases, and providing a source of calcium to the growing embryo. Flaws in eggshell fabrication become a food safety issue, and are believed to be responsible for about 10,000 cases of salmonella poisoning due to cracked eggshells annually in Canada. The objectives of this application are to support research that will provide insight into how eggshell matrix proteins regulate calcite crystallization patterns. 



Significance: Food safety is an important aspect of the chicken eggshell, and these studies will lead to important understanding of how to enhance consumer protection by reducing eggshell cracks. In addition, the eggshell and its associated membrane is an important biomaterial resource that will have further utility in material science once its constituents and mechanism of fabrication are understood. Furthermore, insight into the mechanisms by which calcium carbonate precipitation and crystal growth patterns are regulated in this rapidly calcifying system will be useful for the manufacture of ceramics at ambient temperatures.

"Measurement of isotope fractionation of non-traditional elements has become a valuable tool to study the biogeochemical cycle of metals. Recent advances in multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP/MS) now also allow the determination of mercury isotope fractionation in nature. Our recent work has shown significant deviations of mercury isotope ratios among a variety of natural samples. 



Mercury is a unique isotope system having multiple even and uneven isotopes, and displays not only classical mass dependent, but also rare mass independent fractionation of isotopes. The latter is potentially caused by nuclear field shift and/or magnetic isotope effects. We now propose to systematically investigate these three modes of fractionation and link them to specific reaction pathways that mercury experiences in the environment. Specifically, we will be investigating the reduction of oxidized forms of mercury in aqueous ecosystems leading to volatilization of metallic mercury into the atmosphere, where it is distributed globally. As well, we propose to study the fractionation of mercury during bioaccumulation in food webs. This will be crucial to link local mercury sources to mercury found in fish. To improve the power of the relationship, we will develop methods for compound specific isotope ratio determinations. This will allow a direct determination of isotope ratios in methylmercury, which is the very toxic mercury compound that is bioaccumulated in biota.



All of the gathered information will be assembled to create a comprehensive theoretical framework describing fractionation of the mercury isotope system. Especially, the unusual and unique mass independent fractionation mechanisms hold great promise not only for tracing the biochemical cycling of the element, but also for following mercury from pollution sources to receptor sites such as the Great Lakes or the Canadian Arctic.

The backpropagation learning procedure that is often used to train artificial neural networks does not

work well for deep networks that have many layers of non-linear neurons between the input and the

output.  My group has recently introduced a new approach in which deep networks are ""pretrained"" one

layer at a time using an efficient unsupervised algorithm that tries to model regularities in the

input data. After pretraining, the intermediate layers of a deep network already contain many useful

feature detectors and backpropagation is much better at fine-tuning a pretrained deep network than it

is at learning a deep network from scratch.  In a recent Science paper we showed that this combination

of unsupervised pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning outperforms all other learning methods

at a well-studied discrimination task and also for non-linear dimensionality reduction.



Using this new approach, we plan to apply deep neural networks to a variety of important discrimintion

tasks including object and face recognition. We will also use deep networks to model human motion,

speech, and video sequences.  Using deep networks to extract low-dimensional codes from large, high

dimensional datasets, we will improve web-based recommendation systems. We will also develop deep

networks that can convert documents or images into binary addresses in such a way that semantically

similar documents have similar binary addresses. This allows extremely fast search for similar

documents or images. Finally, we will investigate ways in which these new learning algorithms might be

implemented in the cortex.

"Elms are an economically important feature of urban landscapes across North America.  Their elegant trunks and wide branches provide shade and shelter along many Canadian city streets. There are currently an estimated 700,000 elm trees in cities and towns across Canada however this has been reduced from the many millions of trees planted by urban planners during the past century. The pathogenic fungus Ophiostoma novo-ulmi has frustrated urban planners by selectively killing most of the elm trees planted in North America.  There is currently no effective control for this particularly aggressive phytopathogen and Dutch elm disease remains unchecked.  We are working towards developing a biological control for this pathogen through the development of a transmissible viral-based disease control.  Building upon our research on the functional genomics and population genetics of this fungus we are working towards developing a series of fungal-specific targets to find ways to debilitate this aggressive pathogen. We propose that control of the fungus may be achieved by infecting the pathogen with a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) hypovirus that has been modified to target genes essential to the pathogenicity of this fungus. The improved targeting of transmissible hypovirulence, if proven in O. novo-ulmi, could provide a new approach to the biological control of many fungal pathogens.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","Plant Biology & Food Science"
"Growth in global fish production is due almost entirely to the increase in fin fish production by aquaculture,

representing more than 30% of total fish production for human consumption. The largest cause of economic

losses in aquaculture is from fish diseases, with oomycete fungal infections being second only to bacterial

infections in terms of their impact. These fungi can cause saprolegniosis, a disease observed in both the egg

stage and adult fish, causing illness and mortality. Globally, the top ten commercial species of fin fish are all

known to be affected by this disease. The species Saprolegnia parasitica is the most important causal agent of

this disease, infecting the aquaculture species of salmon, trout and catfish, causing economic losses estimated

in the tens of millions of dollars. Anti-fungal treatments will eliminate the fungus, but not prevent disease

recurrence, as the fungus likely occurs in the water source that supplies a facility. Presently, the origin and

diversity of the pathogen remains undescribed. As well, risk factors that contribute to disease outbreaks in fish

are poorly understood, making the development of effective disease management plans impossible. We intend

to address a major fish health issue that affects productivity and the overall health of fish stocks. An initiative

is required to reduce the economic impact of this disease. This will be facilitated through the development of a

molecular platform of technologies (including DNA fingerprinting) that will permit an evaluation of the genetic

structure of the pathogen population, epidemiological studies in Canadian fish hatcheries, and assist in the

development of improved management practices for this fungal disease in freshwater fish aquaculture.

"Industrialized society is in the process of making a profound shift in its approach to the world as Earth's resources are no longer viewed as effectively infinite; neither in the Earth's ability to supply materials, nor to absorb waste.

To allow this shift, devices that are efficient, low-cost, and have a low environmental impact are required. This research program proposes to advance knowledge in two families of devices that can benefit from the same nano-engineered materials while also delivering on those requirements:

1- Low-cost, higher than 40% conversion efficiency solar cells for electricity generation,

2- Low-power integrated semiconductor lasers for communications systems.

This program is innovative because increased efficiency, combined with lowered production costs, of photovoltaic systems is required for widespread deployment of both solar farms and localised off-grid energy generation. Also, to decrease the total amount of green house gas emissions of the information and communication technology (ICT) sector significantly lower power devices, in low cost packaging must be developed.

Canada will benefit socially, culturally and economically. The proposed program will contribute directly to improving the environment and reducing dependence on non-renewable resources, through clean, green, alternative energy technologies. It will contribute to positioning Canada as a world-leader in high efficiency devices. Equally important, the research will develop highly qualified and skilled personnel that will promote effective knowledge transfer and help fill the employment needs of an industry growing at more than 30% per year.

"The goal of this project is to validate semiconductor amplifier designs through their fabrication, characterisation and system trials. The expected result is a semiconductor amplifier prototype suitable for deployment in next generation optical access networks. The combined requirements of broadband-flattened polarisation-insensitive gain and integrate-ability in a mature materials platform are technically very challenging. The amplifiers will be designed, fabricated in the form of a chip and packaged for comprehensive testing. The characteristics of the individual component will be tested, as well as its impact within novel access network architectures assessed. The focus of this device project is on maximally exploiting an integration platform amenable to the economics of low cost volume manufacture which is essential to widespread adoption of the technology. Our industrial partner, OneChip Photonics Inc. will be the direct receptor of the amplifier solution. OneChip Photonics is a fabless developer and manufacturer of active optical components (e.g. transceivers) for mass deployment in broadband access networks. The amplifier design will be compatible for integration into their proprietary photonic technology. This will expand their target market by adding value to their products while lowering the cost of their complete integrated solution incorporating the amplifier design cell. The project is innovative because it envisages the use of novel amplifier designs to extend and improve the functionality of current access networks whilst reusing the deployed fibre infrastructure, therefore eliminating the need for major capital investments. The proposed research will contribute directly to providing broad-band access to all, which is now essential to the economic and social well-being of developed societies. It will help position Canada as a world-leader in optical fibre broadband access technology, a rapidly expanding sector of the world-wide marketplace.

"The overarching objective of the proposed research is to develop systems engineering methodologies which can account for the conflicting value systems of stakeholders within an overall system of systems framework to informed decision making, for sustainably addressing pressing environmental problems lying at the interface of society, technology and the environment. An underlying motivating goal is to design theoretically sound systems engineering methodologies and to construct accompanying implementation algorithms to permit them to be operationalized as flexible decision support systems for tackling, often in real time, the strategic decision making aspects of major environmental problems facing society, such as water pollution, fresh water shortages, and global warming. The research can be conveniently subdivided into five interconnected components. The first part of the research is to identify how ideas from complex adaptive systems theory can be expanded in order to provide a stable platform for informed engineering decision making which is adaptive and integrative to account for real-time emergent properties of interacting systems of systems. The second component is the systematic study of value systems, which form the most crucial part of any type of decision model, since they dictate how decision makers individually behave and interact with others. Thirdly, research on the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution will permit the competitive and cooperative aspects of strategic decision making to be effectively addressed. Subsequent to determining potential strategic resolutions to a given environmental dispute, tactical Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approaches to bargaining will be developed for carrying out detailed trade-offs among stakeholders to arrive at well-defined sustainable solutions to a specific problem. New MCDA approaches for the categorization of objects into predefined groups, such as the classification of regions according to the level of their vulnerability to climate change, will be investigated. Fifthly, the aforementioned systems engineering methodologies will be developed, tested and enhanced via real world applications in sustainable environmental management.

"Depositing highly adherent diamond thin films on transition metals has been one of the most challenging research subjects in the area of diamond synthesis based on plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition. Steel alloys belong to this category of materials and if diamond deposition on steels can be achieved, the surface properties of steels can be improved dramatically. In the Plasma Physics Laboratory, University of Saskatchewan, it has recently been found that adding a small amount of Al (aluminum) to steels alloys greatly facilitates deposition of high density, adherent diamond thin films. It is speculated that 3d electron of Al is responsible for modifying the electronic structure in the alloy and mitigating the catalytic formation of graphite which is detrimental to diamond growth. XAS (x-ray absorption spectroscopy) available at the Canadian Light Source (CLS) will be used to detect changes in electronic structures with and without Al in steel alloys. The immediate objective of the proposed research is to clarify the mechanism of diamond growth on transition metals and find optimum deposition conditions. The benefit of developing a technology for diamond coating on steel alloys is mainly in surface protection and modification (corrosion and wear resistance, biocompatibility, improved thermal conductivity, etc.) of the most widely used industrial metal.","Mechanical machinery, heavy equipment (including farm, forestry, and construction equipment)","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Manufacturing"

"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has produced mature and widespread tools for the general public, but remains effectively unusable by individuals with severe speech disorders. One group of such disorders, called dysarthria, is caused by neuromuscular disorders such as cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke. While individuals with dysarthria might be able to form and comprehend full sentences, they would lack control over the muscles used in speech, producing unintelligible speech. The neurological damage that causes dysarthria also affects other physical activity, such as slowing keyboard input 150 to 300 fold in severe cases compared with regular users (Hosom et al., 2003; Hux et al., 2000). Speech recognition has the potential to be a viable alternative to keyboard input if poor speech can be reliably recognized.

     The goal of this proposed research is to develop new adaptive ASR software that significantly improves factors such as accuracy and accessibility for dysarthric speech. We will focus on individuals whose speech disabilities limit the use of modern ASR, and for whom keyboard or other alternative interaction methods are insufficient. We intend to accept unrestricted speech entry for novel sentence dictation on computers, telephones, or other devices. Our approach will be unique in that it will be informed by both physiological models of speech production and acoustic data. These models will be constructed by machine learning algorithms upon data to be acquired within the first year of the project. That data will combine 3D and 2D motion parameters of the speech articulators with acoustic data for both dysarthric and non-dysarthric speakers.

     In the long-term, we anticipate that a commercialization of resulting technology will provide direct social benefit by enabling access to services currently impeded by poor speech. Since dysarthria is often a consequence of more general neuromuscular disability prohibiting other kinds of physical movement, dramatic improvement of ASR accuracy is essential, as users with disabilities would likely benefit the most from being able to control devices through speech, as it allows a faster and less fatiguing access mode.

"Our research is in natural language processing and its applications.  Two themes that run through the work are, first, the problems that are created by paraphrase and nuances of meaning in everyday language, and, second, computational notions of semantic distance between words, between larger linguistic expressions, and between documents. In the new research proposed here, we will work on the following problems:  



(1)  Near-synonymy within and across languages:  In our previous work, we developed representations of the nuances of meaning that distinguish near-synonyms, methods for automatically creating a lexical knowledge base from a dictionary of near-synonyms, and mechanisms for choosing the most appropriate near-synonym in the automatic generation of a sentence.  Our next steps in this work will be to enlarge the knowledge base that we derived from near-synonym dictionaries (whose vocabulary is not sufficiently comprehensive) and to develop cross-lingual lexical knowledge bases for use in machine translation.  (2) Opinion identification, extraction, and analysis:  Our research will develop methods for the identification and analysis of opinions, positions, and the arguments and ideologies that underlie them, for the analysis of political, legal, and other position-based texts.  The long-term goal of this work is to be able to take a text, classify its position on a topic or topics, extract the structure of the argument that it makes in support of its position, and then be able to use this in document retrieval and summarization.   (3)  Detecting the influence of one publication on another:  It is often useful to trace the flow and influence of ideas and arguments from one person to another and from one publication to another.  One particular application of opinion identification and analysis is to find documents that present the same or very similar opinions, although possibly in different words and possibly from a different viewpoint.  (An instance of this is not necessarily plagiarism, though it might be.)  We will develop new methods of paraphrase detection at a level sufficiently abstract that we can find such similarities.

"Earth history is recorded in sedimentary basins where detritus from surrounding lands accumulates along with particulate organic matter and biological remains that may later be transformed into oil, natural gas, or coal. The margins of basins are transitional areas where accumulation of detritus is regulated by fluctuating sea levels, wave and current erosion, and downslope transport of suspended sediment by gravity-driven density underflows called ""turbidity currents"". The small seas of western Turkey (Black Sea, Marmara Sea, Aegean Sea) provide unparalleled opportunities to study geological processes important to the evolution of ALL sedimentary basins. Periods of isolation of low-salinity water bodies from the global ocean, then reconnection, have generated strong chemical and biological signals in the sedimentary record that can be used to understand geological processes. Hiscott and collaborator Aksu have collected >100 sediment cores totaling >400 m in combined length in this region - several cores will be used for new graduate-student projects. A key part of the 2009-2014 research is monitoring of a unique saline underflow formed by dense Mediterranean water as it crosses the SW shelf of the low-salinity Black Sea. This is the only place on Earth where a density underflow with properties similar to deep-sea turbidity currents is assessible for monitoring in water depths <100 m. Key questions relate to the velocity structure of such currents and their interaction with bends of sinuous channels so common in the deep sea. The associated channel network was mapped in 2005 & 2008; a sophisticated program of monitoring and seabed sampling will be undertaken in 2010 & 2011 with British collaborators using the UK autonomous submersible AutoSub3. Other work in the region will address questions of organic-matter deposition, sources of sediment in the saline-channel banks and bars, and timing of major floodwater events in the last 15,000 years as the climate of central Asia shifted from a glacial to interglacial mode. Two current PhD students and four new students will receive training in multiple aspects of marine geoscience - several will participate in research cruises and learn practical sampling and surveying methods.

Obesity dramatically increases the risk for developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the number 1 killer of adults in Canada. According to current estimates over 6.8 million adult Canadians are obese placing it among the leadingcauses of preventable death. The primary hypothesis of this research proposal is that muscle of pre-diabetic individuals overproduces myostatin, a circulating protein that regulates muscle size and function and may contribute to disease progression. Our secondary hypothesis is that high levels of circulating fat damages muscle mitochondria, the cellular powerhouses. These finding are both important because there is a general decline in muscle function with the progression ofobesity to full-blown type 2 diabetes. The experiments described in this research proposal will help determine the role of

myostatin and mitochondrial damage in the deterioration of muscle function with obesity. In addition, myostatin will beevaluated as a diagnostic biomarker of the pre-diabetic state. With type 2 diabetes reaching epidemic proportions in thepopulation, a more complete understanding of muscle dysfunction with obesity is essential for developing new diagnostic and therapeutic targets","Medical and health sciences","Integrative Animal Biology"

Not only does cellular phone become a necessity for many people, other wireless technologies such as wireless local area networks and Bluetooth are gradually  integrated into our daily life. This  increasing popularity of wireless technologies, together with advances in multi-media applications, pose a number of technical challenges for the industry: given the physical limitations on the transmit power level, spectrum, and device size, how can we continue to provide affordable devices and services to the ever-demanding consumers? A key word here is MIMO, which refers to a wireless communication technology whereby information is beamed to the user 's device via multiple transmit and  one or more receive antennas. This system architecture is a departure from the traditional practice of employing only one transmit antenna. Essentially, MIMO introduces an added system resource, namely spatial redundancy, at no extra cost! Wireless systems based on MIMO technologies are expected to offer a dramatic increase in capacity when compared to conventional systems. The primary goal of this research is to devise coding and signal processing means that simplify MIMO system implementation while at the same time make them more reliable and more power/bandwidth efficient. A secondary goal is to use the research program as a platform to train highly qualified personnel who eventually will assist the Canadian industry to compete in this multi-billion dollar worldwide market of wireless technologies.

"The Internet service subscribers, including both enterprises and general end users, expect for high availability of Internet connections from their service providers. Guarantee of end-to-end (E2E) availability for each connection in dynamic Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switched (GMPLS) networks has been an attractive design objective. The previous research work in the related areas has focused on development of survivable routing schemes for single or dual simultaneous failures under a given type of protection. However, as the state-of-the-art communication carrier networks evolve to a multi-service bandwidth provisioning environment, the E2E availability of each LSP has become a major performance index for achieving Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantee percieved by the end users. This fact has imposed a fundamental impact on the development of survivable routing and spare capacity allocation schemes since the end users may not care about how many simultaneous failures the carrier can handle, and what type of protection scheme the carrier adopts. Driven by the observations, this project is committed to work on a general availability-aware service provisioning architecture in GMPLS networks for both real-time and non real-time services, where the long-term and short-term E2E availability of each connection will be defined and manipulated. Based on the availability models, the corresponding enhancement on the reported survivable routing and spare capacity allocation schemes will be investigated. The proposed research is envisioned to provide a complete solution to survivable routing problems by leaving some of the previous design issues, such as ""how many simultaneous failures the carrier can handle"", and ""what type of protection scheme we had better adopt"", no longer as problems. Such survivable routing architecture is expected to better fit into the design requirements of modern communication carrier networks where service availability is the ultimate goal of redundancy investment and survivability guarantee. The project will also lead to HQP training in availability analysis and optimization techniques, which will greatly contribute to the Canadian communication industry.

"This project aims at the development of tapered thermoplatic composite tail booms for helicopters which has

the configuration of a tapered cylinder. It connects the cabin of the helicopter to the tail rotor, whose function is

to control the direction and stability of the aircraft. The tail boom is subjected to a large amount of bending

moments and stresses. For weight saving purposes, the tail boom is usually a thin walled tube. It is located in

the wake of the exhaust gas coming from the engine. As such, it needs to be made of a material with sufficient

high temperature performance. The tail boom has been made using aluninum which possesses the

characteristics of light weight, sufficiently good strength, stiffness and temperature performance. The increased

usage of composites in aircrafts by major aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus has opened the way

for more innovative usage of composites in airframe structures. The use of composites to make helicopter tail

booms can translate into significant savings in terms of manufacturing time, and excellent fatigue performance.

Thermoplastic composites such as carbon/PEEK offer very attractive characteristics such as excellent strength

and stiffness, good temperature performance and reasonably large amount of data base. However technology

for making composite cylinders using automated fiber placement process only came out a few years ago. The

fabrication of tapered cylinders poses many challenges including the requirement to address the laps and gaps

between layers, or curved fiber paths. This also gives rise to manufacturing, analysis and design issues. This

"The main objectives of this research proposal are the design of efficient algorithms for a number of graph classes and the study of their structures. Examples of graph classes we are interested in are chordal graphs, weakly chordal graphs, perfectly orderable graphs, perfect graphs, and 2-divisible graphs. These graphs in most cases have structures that can be exploited to design efficient algorithms for recognition and optimization. We will approach these problems in the view of two recent developments: robust algorithms and certifying algorithms. An algorithm for a graph class C is robust if it gives the correct solution when the input graph is in the class; if the input is not in C, then the algorithm either still produces a correct solution or answers that the input is not in C. A certifying algorithm is one that produces a certificate with each output that proves that it has not been compromised by an implementation bug. For example, a certifying algorithm for recognizing a planar graph G produces either a planar embedding of G, or one of the two Kuratowski graphs. These two notions provide new and fresh insights into the design of algorithms.","Mathematical sciences","Pure & Applied Maths - B"

"Modern pharmaceuticals have revolutionized our ability to treat or cure most major diseases.  Typically, drug treatments require repeated oral, nasal, or injection-based treatments, ultimately leading to transport of the drug into the bloodstream to be distributed throughout the body.  However, such systemic drug treatments can lead to significant side-effects and require repeat administrations which are inconvenient and often uncomfortable for the patient.  As a result, polymer-based drug delivery devices which can release controlled doses of drugs at both the rate and location required in the body would lead to significantly improved clinical outcomes in the treatment of many diseases.  The co-applicants are all actively involved in developing novel drug delivery systems which would meet these requirements.  Materials including hydrogels which will spontaneously form when injected into the body to control drug release, new types of biodegradable microparticles and nanoparticles which can overcome many of the current issues with loading and stabilizing large concentrations of sensitive drugs, bioactive paper which can bind, detect, or release drugs, and composite hydrogel-nanoparticle materials which can be remotely triggered to deliver new types of pharmaceutical targets with adjustable, repeatable doses are all under development within the labs of the co-applicants.  These materials are currently being applied for developing new ophthalmic, intramuscular, or intravenous drug delivery vehicles which can deliver a full spectrum of target drugs over durations ranging from several hours to several months.  Integral to successful development of such materials is the availability of a method to measure the amount of drug which can be encapsulated inside these new materials and subsequently released over time.  In this context, access to a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) is urgently needed to make accurate, high-sensitivity measurements of the drug doses released from these new materials and thus assess the potential of such materials for meeting existing drug delivery challenges.

"Microgels are spherical gel particles which have diameters on the nanoscale and can shrink or expand in response to environmental stimuli such as temperature, pH, or the concentration of a particular chemical in the gel environment. Microgels have many advantages over hydrogels in biomedical applications, including

their large surface areas, good injectability, protein-mimetic surface chemistry, and fast responses to environmental stimuli. However, most microgels are not biodegradable and can accumulate in the body over time; furthermore, microgels are very mobile within the body, generally leading to rapid sequestering of gel

nanoparticles in the spleen or the liver. The proposed research aims to address these two challenges by developing novel approaches for synthesizing and delivering microgels for biomedical applications. Microgels will be prepared by using different biodegradable crosslinkers to gel short polymer fragments which can be

resorbed through the kidney. The physical and biological properties of a range of different microgels will be investigated to optimize the particle properties, degradation rate, and cell-particle interactions for specific applications. Drug-loaded microgels will be co-injected with a material which spontaneously forms a hydrogel under physiological conditions, immobilizing microgels locally in the body. Particular focus will be paid to microgels which selectively release insulin as the glucose concentration is increased (creating a self-regulating ""artificial pancreas"" for diabetes treatment) and microgels which can be triggered by external energy sources such as magnetism to repeatedly and non-invasively release drugs locally within the body. Microgels with pH sensitivity will also be investigated as microbicides and vaccines which can be triggered to both physically entrap viruses like HIV and selectively deliver an anti-viral agent. Finally, patterned microgel surfaces will be investigated to control cell differentiation into different tissues and mimic nerve function. Implementation of this research plan would significantly advance the science of responsive materials and offer enhanced clinical strategies for improving health outcomes in both Canada and the developing world.

"Over the past 10 years, a chain of 12 atmospheric/meteor radars has been constructed that stretches from the Antarctic to the Arctic through North and South America. I am principal investigator on 5, share a sixth, and collaborate with other scientists on another 6. Others exist world-wide. These radars all have a common heritage, scientifically designed by me. They measure winds and temperatures between 80 and 100 km altitude, and I am still developing even more applications. This spread represents the broadest latitudinal coverage and highest latitudinal density of any single type of middle atmosphere radar. I am currently integrating all the data from these facilities into a common web site at which all these data are displayed and updated every few hours, facilitating interactions between the radar owners and other researchers world-wide. The web site, and the ensuing collaborative science that is resulting, represents the first time that middle atmosphere meteorology has been displayed for general user access in near-real-time on such a frequent and world-wide scale. This system will allow unique new perspectives on global studies of upper atmospheric dynamics, comparable in latitudinal coverage to many satellites, and superior to all satellites in regard to temporal coverage and vertical resolution. When combined with several other VHF windprofiler radars that I operate in Canada, including in the Arctic, the system makes a powerful national and international major facility for studies of atmospheric processes at 80 to 100 km altitude. The proposed program of research will capitalize on this unique capability. Studies will include wind and temperature investigations of planetary wave, tidal and gravity wave oscillations, studies of momentum flux and divergence, wind forcing, vertical winds, turbulence strengths and microsctructure, radar scattering mechanisms, effects of enhanced Carbon Dioxide in the upper atmosphere, and meteor/space-debris physics, among others. The network has already been employed to assist with NASA Space Shuttle re-entries. With 46 refereed publications in the last 6 years, I have proven my capability to successfully employ these networks, and look forward to achieving their full potential.

"One of the major threats to imperiled species is the loss of habitat.  In forests, this loss often leaves remnant stands of the original forest surrounded by other stands that differ in age or species composition.  For forest mammals, these complex mosaics of different stand types strongly affect population dynamics; for some species, populations decline as habitat fragmentation occurs.  Often, predators and prey in forests will respond to fragmentation at different spatial scales, with prey staying in particular forest stands and predators moving among stands.  As habitat loss occurs and the stands that prey can use become smaller or farther apart, predators may not be able to obtain enough prey to survive because the cost of traveling among the stands with prey becomes too high.  I am interested in how forest mammals respond to forest fragmentation, and my main research objective is to explain how predator-prey interactions are changed as a landscape becomes increasingly fragmented.  The population dynamics of prey in different stand types will largely determine whether their predators can persist in a fragmented landscape.  At one extreme, prey might use only a few, far apart stands; at the other extreme, they might occur in the majority of stands.  As a model system, I am focusing on snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) and Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) in western Montana.  I am characterizing density, survival, and reproduction of hares in different stand types.  I am then exploring which stand types lynx use for hunting, how far they travel between kills, and what proportion of their diet consists of hares in this region.  I am unifying these results in spatial models so that I can model the effects of  changing the amount of different types of habitat on these species.  This research program will advance our general understanding of how predators and prey respond to forest fragmentation, as well as predicting configurations of remaining forest stands that might help to retain species in the landscape.

"Over the past decade, computer-assisted surgery has moved from concept to prototype to product and surgeons are now able to use imaging and kinematic data in quantitative ways to precisely guide their interventions. However, few applications in orthopaedics have been widely adopted. One major reason for this is that the first generation of computer-assisted applications in orthopaedics have relied on costly imaging techniques that are simply not used for routine procedures or they have used complex and expensive robotic devices modified from industrial systems. Operating times are typically extended, and often the systems do not adequately predict the consequences of surgical choices on other outcomes of interest. Furthermore, the systems that have been commercialized are generally quite costly (on the order of $250,000 for image-based systems and upwards of $1M for systems incorporating robots), so most hospitals, particularly those in Canada, have not been able to justify their purchase. 



The primary goal of my research then is to make it possible for a wide array of surgeons, including those in community hospitals outside academic centres, to take advantage of image-guided or kinematics-based techniques by creating innovative devices, instrumentation and surgical approaches which can achieve surgical outcomes comparable to these first-generation systems, while being based either on image-free techniques or on inexpensive and readily available imaging modalities (e.g., fluoroscopy and ultrasound) and incorporating highly functional yet inexpensive robotic tools and surgical devices. A second goal of focusing on clinical practicality will be to minimize operating time, thereby enhancing acceptability of image-guided procedures. Finally, biomechanical modeling developed in my research will enable surgeons to comprehensively predict the consequences of a surgical plan and allow them to refine and optimize it, as well as to execute it accurately.

"The acoustical environment in a workroom has a direct effect on the health, well-being and productivity of the workers.  The direct and indirect socio-economic costs of such problems can be enormous.  'Green' buildings, the future of architecture have particular acoustical problems which lead to great occupant dissatisfaction.  The problems must be investigated and resolved.  'Green' roofs have potential for noise control that must be investigated.  Workroom acoustical environments can be controlled. This is often done retroactively;  optimization of the acoustical environment at the design stage is much more cost-effective.  Noise control traditionally involves passive methods;  the future of noise control involves active methods.  The proposed research will provide the knowledge, predictive tools and noise-control measures to allow the acoustical environment in workrooms to be optimized at the design stage.  It will apply inverse methods to obtain realistic data on room-prediction parameters in existing rooms, as well as to develop a method for identifying noise sources in industrial workshops.  Models will be developed for predicting sound-pressure fields in workshops, including obstacles, and in 'green' buildings, and sound transmission between rooms through partitions with ventilators, possibly acoustically treated.  The models will be used to optimize ventilator design.  A model for predicting the optimal configuration, and the effectiveness, of a local active-control system in workshops will be consolidated and applied.  The potential for using 'green' roofs to control external-internal noise transmission will be studied.  Active-control technology will be integrated into 'green'-building ventilator design.

"Our objective is to identify the components of heavy oil (Fuel Oil No 6; i.e. Bunker C) that cause chronic toxicity to fish embryos. Following the 2005 spill of Bunker C into L. Wabamun, AB, it was evident that there are few data on aquatic toxicity to assess the unique ecological risks of oil that sinks and contaminates spawning shoals. Using different exposure scenarios, we will demonstrate bioavailability and toxicity of the components of Bunker C that persist after oil spills and that threaten fisheries recruitment. As well, tests of enhanced chemical metabolism in trout cells in culture, and of chronic toxicity to trout embryos will be combined with chemical analyses of oil fractions to identify those classes of compounds associated with

toxicity. The products of this research will be: (1) a first-ever identification of the components of a heavy oil associated with chronic toxicity to fish; (2) perspective on how heavy oil compares to a medium and light oils in terms of toxicity, the nature of toxic effects, and the chemical structures associated with toxicity; (3) toxicity data for ecological risk assessments and site remediation; (4) an effects-driven fractionation strategy for future assessments of other heavy oils, and (5) specific methods for fractionation, toxicity testing, and chemical analysis. To meet a growing need for environmental scientists as large numbers of government and industry scientists retire over the next 10 years, this project will train two MSc and two PhD students, plus 3

"The American eel (Anguilla rostrata) is on the verge of local extinction in L. Ontario, due to a precipitous decline in the arrival of juvenile eels from their spawning grounds in the Sargasso Sea. All L. Ontario eels are female, and they are the largest and most fecund females of the species. Hence, their loss will affect the status of the entire species because eels spawn as only one population. These impacts are already apparent in the closure of the L. Ontario fishery, a reduction by more than 50% of the fishery in Quebec, and declines in many eel fisheries throughout N. America. Chemicals accumulated by eels during their freshwater growth are one likely cause of premature mortality of eel embryos as they migrate from the Sargasso to fresh water. During their growth in fresh water, eels become top predators, accumulating compounds such as PCBs and polychlorinated dioxins to concentrations similar to those causing reproductive failure of lake trout in L. Ontario. Our objectives are to evaluate if eels accumulate sufficient chemical contaminants during their growth and maturation to cause embryo toxicity, and to estimate when contaminants might have affected eel recruitment. Our team of university and government scientists, including colleagues in the US and Europe, will collect fresh and archived samples of eels from reference and contaminated ecosystems. The eels will be analyzed for concentrations of chemicals known to be embryo-toxic, such as chlorinated and brominated organic compounds, selenium, and alkyl tin. The toxicity of extracted chemicals will be assessed with a battery of tests using fish embryos and fish cells in culture. The inclusion of archived samples and an extensive literature on chemical effects on other fish species will allow a retrospective assessment of the risks of chemicals to eel reproduction. Using these data, we will advise fisheries managers about the suitability of different habitats for re-stocking with juvenile eels, priorities for chemical controls, and potential hazards to human consumers. Because eels are highly valued and have a long time to maturity (7-30 years), it is essential that this research be done now, to help avoid a complete loss of eels from the Great Lakes.",Environment,"Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Environment"
"    )	Alkyl polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH with one or more alkyl side chains) are found in  crude oil, creosote, and contaminated sediments of rivers and harbours.  Alkyl PAH are classified according to their parent structures and to the numbers of carbons in side chains. There are more than a dozen classes, and a single class, such as alkyl phenanthrenes, may include more than 500 unique compounds with 1 to 4 carbons in side chains. While little studied, they comprise more than 90% of total PAH in crude oil, and contributed to the impacts on fisheries of the Exxon Valdez oil spill. They are rapidly taken up by fish, which respond by producing cytochrome-P450 (CYP1A) enzymes.  These enzymes add oxygen to alkyl PAH as the first step in their excretion.  However, oxygenation may create metabolites that are more harmful than the parent compound.  Hence, faster excretion carries a risk of greater toxicity, which is expressed as circulatory collapse and death of embryos and larvae, the most sensitive life stages. 

    )	My objective is to understand how the metabolism of alkyl PAH affects their toxicity to embryonic and larval fish.  This research will test: (1) whether circulatory collapse is due to direct effects on the heart or results from indirect effects of edema following lipid membrane damage; (2) whether the parent alkyl PAH or the products of their metabolism (reactive oxygen species, reactive metabolites) are the proximate toxic agents affecting the heart and lipid membranes; (3) whether modulating metabolism of alkyl PAH by inhibiting activity or expression of enzymes that  oxygenate PAH will modulate toxicity; and (4) whether different classes of alkyl PAH have different mechanisms of toxicity.  The knowledge generated by this research will help to predict the hazards of untested alkyl PAH, singly and in complex mixtures, and provide data and tools for assessing the ecological risks of oil spills in Canada's rapidly expanding petroleum economy.

"The use of Web search engines constitutes an important part of the activities that people perform on the Web. While significant effort has gone into the creation of Web search engines that can index billions of documents and return the results in fractions of a second, the interfaces used by the top search engines have remained essentially unchanged since the early days of the Web. Little support is provided for searchers as they attempt to craft a query. Even if they are able to provide a good query, the commonly used list-based representation does little to assist searchers in finding the information they seek. 

    The research program described in this proposal is a logical extension of Dr. Hoeber's recent Ph.D. work. The goal is to investigate the use of visualization and interaction techniques as a means for supporting the fundamental tasks Web searchers perform. Intelligent methods for displaying, organizing, and interacting with the information present in Web search tasks will lead to advancements in the interfaces used by Web search engines. These next-generation Web search interfaces will have a significant impact on how people search for and find information in the future. By taking advantage of our ability to visually process information, the cognitive burden associated with searching the Web can be reduced. Searchers will be able to recognize and explore elements of interest, rather than having to remember specific details.

    Overviews of five research projects are provided in the proposal, focusing on personalization within Web search tasks, visual representations of Web search results, studies on interactive exploration of Web search results, visual representations of free-text queries, and using visualization to assist in re-finding information. This program of research illustrates the breadth and depth of investigations that can be undertaken in the area of visual and interactive Web search. The design, development, and study of prototype systems throughout these and other research projects will contribute to our understanding of how visualization and interaction can be used to support the human element in Web search.","Computer software","Computing and Information Sciences - A"
"Effective communication of public statistics to Canadian citizens has many potential benefits, including: an increased capacity for business and community planning; increased productivity through better decision-making; and generally, a better understanding of the society in which we live. Recent technological advances have made the Web-based delivery of visual representations of public statistics a possibility. As with all other stages of the compilation of statistical data, however, great care must be taken to ensure an effective and unbiased dissemination of the data. The goal of this research is to design and evaluate a collection of visual representations of statistical data for the effective geo-spatial communication of this information to the Canadian public. We will evaluate existing visual representations in order to gain a full understanding of what is currently available, and develop alternative visualization techniques to support the public dissemination of statistical information. In partnership with Statistics Canada and the Newfoundland and Labrador Statistical Agency, we will develop a Web-enabled geo-visual analytics toolkit designed to meet the needs of the Canadian public, populate the toolkit with a well-chosen collection of data, and perform user evaluations to determine the effectiveness of communication of the information. The primary outcome of this research project will be a publicly accessible geo-visual analytics system designed to promote the awareness and use of statistical information through interactive visualization and exploration tools. The specific geo-visual modules designed and developed in the course of this research will be released to the open-source community, making them freely available for use by government agencies, industry, and academia. Knowledge discovered through the design, development, and study of these systems will be published and promoted through academic journals and conferences.","Information systems and technology","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Communications and Information"

"Our multidisciplinary biomedical research team uses cultured cells to develop safe and effective therapies to regenerate damaged tissues such as cartilage. We are also creating novel gene delivery methods for treating chronic diseases. To do this, we need to know more about how cells recognize and react to biomaterials, and how cells can be optimally induced to express foreign genes. Our research program uses cells obtained from consented human volunteers, and cell lines that continually divide in culture. Over the years we have developed a large and valuable repertoire of cell stocks that are very useful in exploring the complex reactions of cells to biomaterials and nanoparticles, and how cells can be led to release vast quantities of therapeutic proteins. We also use cells in our biomedical engineering teaching program. Because cells are used on a periodic basis, our vast repertoire of cell lines, clones, and primary cells require a sensitive and controlled system to preserve the stocks in a stable frozen state known as cryopreservation. Currently our group is lacking equipment needed to freeze and store a large number of cell stocks. This grant application is a request for funds to equip our laboratories with cryopreservation equipment so that we can maintain and preserve cells useful for developing new treatments.

"The knee is a complex organ that depends on healthy cartilage for pain-free articulation and proper joint function. Damaged cartilage can lead to joint pain and stiffness, loss of quality of life, and eventually lead a patient to seek clinical help. To re-grow cartilage over areas of exposed bone, many surgeons use an arthroscopic technique called microfracture to induce bleeding from the base of the cartilage lesion and stimulate a natural cartilage-repair response. When successful, these so-called ""resurfacing"" procedures can re-stabilize the joint and slow the progression of osteoarthritis. To improve the current standard of care, we have developed therapeutic implants which are made of patient whole blood mixed with chitosan, a biopolymer that contains glucosamine. Our research has shown that chitosan helps repair damaged bone and cartilage by

attracting white blood cells and new blood vessels that help revitalize the repair environment. Older patients who who would like to have cartilage repair are sometimes given joint replacements instead, because the bone below their damaged cartilage is too dense to permit attraction of stem cells to regrow cartilage. In this proposal, we will develop new minimally-invasive therapies and bioactive polymer formulations to stimulate the bone below the cartilage lesion to become porous and vascularized. Our new approach will revitalize subchondral bone in aging patients to improve therapeutic results after surgical treatment of chronic cartilage lesions. Our goal is to generate new therapies will restore joint function and alleviate the pain and discomfort of arthritis.","Medical and health sciences","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Biomedical Technologies"
"Tissue engineering is intended to replace damaged organs, and invariably requires the regeneration of lost blood vessels.  We have discovered a new avenue for regenerating blood vessels, by implanting biodegradable polymers that stimulate the innate immune system to release angiogenic factors. Phagocytes are innate immune cells that circulate in our blood stream, whose role is to recognize and eliminate bacteria and foreign materials. Sometimes when phagocytes are activated, they release factors that stimulate growth of new blood vessels.  More research is needed to understand how implanted biomaterials can be used to stimulate a predictable angiogenic response by innate immune cells. All biodegradable materials, after coming into contact with body fluids, acquire a coating of proteins and other factors that can have therapeutic or pathological consequences. The aim of our research program is to further our understanding of how the immune system recognizes and responds to biomaterials of different charge state and solubility. To accomplish our goal we need to better understand how biomaterial structure influences ""biofouling"" of the polymer surface with plasma proteins and other blood factors.  Results from this research program will result in the development of novel medical devices that offer a more predictable and optimal therapeutic effect.

"Red River College of Applied Arts, Science and Technology will establish a Sustainable Infrastructure Technology Research Group (SITRG). This group will build upon the resources, experience and capabilities resident of the Centre for Applied Research in Sustainable Infrastructure (CARSI), the College's first dedicated applied research facility. Established with support from the Canada Foundation for Innovation, as well as community and regional partners, CARSI is dedicated to sustainable infrastructure research activities concerning construction and building technology. CARSI and Manitoba Hydro recently completed an 18-month research project in which the CARSI facility featured a full-bay mock-up/prototype of the

double-skin curtain wall for Manitoba Hydro's new corporate headquarters in Downtown Winnipeg, which is one of the most energy-efficient commercial building in North America. Based on the very positive outcomes from this project, as well as increasing interaction, input and projects involving small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMEs), it is clear that there is both need and demand in the region for applied research in building science, with special attention to Northern and cold climate applications. Therefore, the SITRG will study novel technologies and methods that are intended to improve the energy performance of new and existing buildings in Manitoba. Applied research activities will be concentrated on four areas: building envelopes; mechanical and renewable energy systems; building performance monitoring; and reducing the embodied

energy of buildings. Impacts of this initiative will include the greater availability of graduates with relevant applied research experience; greater interaction and responsiveness to industry, especially SME's; new and enhanced collaborations and partnerships; and new and/or improved building technologies, suitable for Northern and cold climates. These impacts will enhance the ability of Manitoba's building sector to reduce energy use and thereby contribute to provincial and national efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

"The focus of this proposal is to develop a simple implantable electrode system that will help regain the use of

the diaphragm muscle in people who have lost the ability to breathe naturally and now depend on mechanical

ventilation for survival. Muscle paralysis can be temporary, or permanent when caused by an injury or disease

in the brain or spinal cord control centres. Paralyzed muscles can often be activated again by electrically

stimulating the nerves that connect to the muscles and providing appropriate activation patterns with an

implanted electronic control device. For people requiring mechanical ventilation this method can be lifesaving,

but has significant problems: it requires apparatus that is not readily portable so a patient tied to a ventilator

suffers atrophy of muscles and overall decline in well being; it interferes with eating and speaking; it tends to

provide insufficient venting which can lead to accumulation of fluid in the lungs and infection; requires costly

supervision, maintenance and disposables; and extends the duration and cost of hospitalization.

To help people who now depend on mechanical ventilation, we are developing an alternative solution of

electrically stimulating the phrenic nerves and ""pacing"" the diaphragm as required for breathing, using a

minimally invasive, intravenous method to place electrodes inside main veins that course near the phrenic

nerves. This method only requires local anesthesia, has been shown to be feasible in animals, and promises to

change the life of thousands of people who are now permanently dependent on a breathing machine.

The objectives of this proposal are: 1. Model the electrical fields produced by intravenous electrodes in relation

to nerves in proximity to the veins, 2. Fabricate and test electrode prototypes, 3. Assess in an animal model the

long-term safety and efficacy of pacing the diaphragm, and 4. fabricate and validate prototype electrodes

"Even when we sleep, the brain is not at rest. On the contrary, during sleep, the brain is full of synchronized neural activity that takes the shape of slow oscillations. These oscillations have long been associated with helping memories to strengthen, or 'consolidate', yet the brain regions involved during slow waves and the processing they undergo is still unresolved. Neurons in the neocortex that were active during an experience 'reactivate' during these sleep oscillations, suggesting one way of strengthening a memory trace. Although this phenomenon was first seen in the rat hippocampus - a structure that helps in forming new memories, I went on to show that reactivation occurs as a synchronized process throughout large, separated regions of the neocortex. This was also the first demonstration of memory trace reactivation in primates, an important prerequisite if reactivation underlies the consolidation of memories in humans. 



I plan to continue to fill the gap that lies between our understanding of memories in humans and of neural 'replay' in other mammals. Using techniques I've helped to develop over the last nine years, we will listen to activity in regions of the brain that encode faces and social stimuli. Large ensembles of activity from the temporal lobe will be used to determine whether the distributed memory traces of recently-seen individuals replay in the brain during sleep. Because activity from large ensembles in the temporal lobe have not been recorded before, we will first determine when the ensembles are acting as a global 'symphony orchestra' and when they are acting as multiple, independent small 'chamber orchestras'. We expect that memory replay will be most likely during periods when the 'orchestra' is globally synchronized - possibly during slow oscillations. Although synchronization may hold the key to memory formation, unchecked, it may lead to epilepsy, commonly generated in the temporal lobe. Thus, the benefits of understanding temporal lobe oscillations may include or even extend beyond an understanding of how the brain creates memories.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences"

"Physical activity is important for reducing one's risk of colon cancer. The underlying biology about how physical activity protects against this cancer is not known. Understanding the basic biological mechanisms is necessary so that we can design the most effective exercise programs to lower the colon cancer risk for different groups of individuals (for example, seniors, people with a family history of cancer, etc.). This NSERC funded research focuses on immune cells, known as T lymphocytes, in the gastrointestinal tract (intestine and colon) of mice. The research asks whether long term moderate-intensity exercise training 1) prevents (or lessens) the death of immune cells in the bowel which kill cancer cells and 2) prevents (or lessens) the occurrence of inflammation in the bowel by increasing anti-oxidants in these immune cells. To test these hypotheses, female mice will have voluntary access to running wheels for many months or will be sedentary (no running wheels). At the end of the exercise training, immune cells (T lymphocytes) from the gastrointestinal tract of the mice will be removed and tested for anti-cancer functions, for the levels of anti-oxidant enzymes, and for viability. These studies will provide the first step to determine if physical activity increases the anti-tumour and anti-inflammatory functions of immune cells in the bowel.

"One objective of this study is to identify potential positive and negative side effects to the use of advanced oxidation (AO) with UV+hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for drinking water treatment. UV+H2O2 could become more popular as a method for taste and odour control in tap water. Preliminary evidence suggests that such treatment could either enhance or lessen the formation of subsequent chlorination by-products, and also have an impact on chlorine stability in the distribution system. These issues are being explored more fully in this project.



Another potential application of AO treatment is for the destruction of endocrine disrupting compounds and pharmaceutical and personal care products in municipal wastewater. AO has historically been prohibitively expensive for widespread use for wastewater treatment, however the technology may become more affordable and practical when paired with increasingly-popular membrane bioreactors (MBRs). This research specifically examines AO effectiveness when treating MBR effluent, with an aim to identify conditions that strengthen or weaken its effectiveness. 



Overall, the research will provide a major advance in information for the consulting industry and practitioners with respect to the strengths and weaknesses of advanced oxidation in both municipal drinking water and wastewater treatment.

"Realizability is an overarching name for a family of interpretations of constructive systems. Ultimately, such an interpretation relies on a notion of effective computation, and it provides a connection between such a notion of computation and the notion of a constructive proof. 

On the other hand, categorical logic, and in particular topos theory, gives a very general way of interpreting constructive theories. Subsuming various other types of semantics for constructive theories (such as Kripke models and Heyting-valued semantics), it has been widely used to provide models for consistency and independence results. 

Combining the two types of semantics, one obtains a so-called realizability topos. Many of such toposes have been constructed, and they turned out to have remarkable properties, with surprising applications to theoretical computer science and constructive mathematics. 

However, realizability toposes turn out to be a different kind of toposes than their geometric counterparts, Grothendieck toposes. Whereas the theory of the latter class is well-developed, most realizability toposes have been studied in isolation only, and no good understanding is available of what this world of toposes as a whole looks like. Indeed, it has been compared to a stamp collection.

This project is aimed at obtaining a structural understanding of the world of realizability toposes by organizing them in a suitable framework, and by studying the properties of this framework. As realizability is ultimately concerned with computation, this will require a study of certain models of computation, and of the ways in which they can interact.

"There has been an increasing awareness of contaminants in the aquatic environment and evidence for their capacity to affect organisms through the disruption of the natural action of hormones. Although hormonal systems are often studied in isolation, they do not work in isolation, but instead interact at several levels to regulate development and reproduction in an organism. Our ability to predict the risk that contaminants pose to amphibians (and other animals) is currently limited by lack of knowledge as to how different hormonal systems work together. Thus, it is imperative that we understand how hormone systems interact in order to accurately predict the impact of these contaminants on animal health. This research will address knowledge gaps in the interaction of thyroid hormone and reproductive hormone systems. This research will explore the relationship between the amphibian thyroidal- and reproductive-endocrine systems by examining their interactions within the context of a specific reproductive function: hormone production in the gonad. We will also use the process of metamorphosis to examine how these interactions are influenced by developmental changes in endocrine status. This research has the potential to provide important new ideas about thyroidal involvement in reproduction and will allow us to study how changes in thyroid status, either in development or as a result of contaminant exposure, can influence reproduction.

"Although my research program concerns the study of some abstract algebraic structures (Coxeter groups), it admits ramifications ranging from theoretical physics to statistics, throughout various applications in other fields of mathematics. Coxeter groups appear naturally as a set of transformations (symmetry) of regular polyhedrons, and therefore  are playing an important role in crystallography. They can also be found virtually in almost all areas of mathematics. For example in relation to simple Lie algebras and Kac-Moody algebras, or in some aspects of refined study of Euclidean geometry and hyperbolic geometry.



The originality of my approach is to exploit the combinatorial properties of these groups as the key for a better understanding of their related structures. In particular, the aim of my research is the creation of new combinatorial tools arising from the study of Coxeter groups to refine the knowledge we have of their associated structures. More specifically, the purpose is to have a clearer understanding of the concept of Descent algebras, Combinatorial Hopf algebras and Generalized Associahedra. For instance, generalized associahedra are fundamental geometric objects in the study of cluster algebras, whose ramifications extend to physics, thermodynamics and statistics.

"In Canada, substance abuse imparts a measurable burden on society and family life in part as a result of its devastating effects on premature death and disability.  In addition, there is a significant strain on the economy due to its impact on the health care and criminal justice systems.  According to a Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse survey, the overall social cost of substance abuse in Canada is estimated to be $39.8 billion, reflecting a cost of over $1,000 to every living person in Canada each year.  Substance abuse is a problem that must be addressed on all fronts.  Potential solutions to problems associated with the use of alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs must be as subtle and diverse as the problems themselves and the people they affect.  Substance abuse is a complex disorder which involves the interaction of environmental factors, multiple brain regions and a vast array of neurochemical factors that are believed to increase the susceptibility of an individual to addictive behavior.  The present work attempts to shed some light on these subtleties and complexities. With the acquisition of state-of-the art equipment to fully operate 12 operant chambers (i.e., 'Skinner' boxes), the experiments laid out in this proposal are set to determine the brain mechanisms that undergo substantial changes during the development, maintenance and termination of addictive-like behaviors, some of which may underlie substance abuse problems.  During the course of this research, preclinical studies using rats will be utilized to more fully understand the neurochemical and structural changes in the brain that underlie addiction.  The experiments will study all levels of brain function from neurochemicals and molecules, through brain cells, to the whole brain and the behaving organism.  These studies will provide a foundation for a clearer understanding of the multiple neural components underlying the substance abuse and addiction process and lead to the development of treatments to curtail these devastating disorders.

"Many connections between brain cells (neurons) are stable and do not change over time.  However, a number of neural connections are gained and lost over time due to environmental events, suggesting that ""wiring"" in the brain can be altered.  One part of the brain that has been shown to be critical for memory processes is the hippocampus.  The proposed research will investigate wiring changes in the hippocampus that are associated with and may be critical for memory function.  The overarching theme of these experiments is to provide a more complete understanding of the interactions between structural modification (wiring), intrinsic neural properties (genetic processes) and cognitive processes (memory). The elucidation of learning-associated structural plasticity and its neurochemical underpinnings may lead to the identification of general neural mechanisms that mediate plasticity in the central nervous system.  These studies are appealing as they will provide empirical evidence concerning variations in cognition and memory processes in relation to structural plasticity in specific brain circuits.  These learning-induced changes may help provide a fundamental knowledge of the mechanisms subserving cognitive enhancement in adults. This could have potential applications for altering the basic mechanisms by which memories are formed and lost.  The results may also lead to important insights into learning disorders as well as studies into Alzheimer's disease.  Gaining a basic understanding of memory function is a critical step to understand memory dysfunction.",Psychology,"Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences"

"Fuel cells are electrochemical systems that convert a fuel and oxidant into electrical power. Proton Exchange

Membrane (PEM) fuel cells, are a class of fuel cell in which a polymeric membrane serves to separate the two

reactants and provides an electrolytic path for ions to travel between the anode and the cathode. The

electrochemical, physico-chemical, mechanical properties of the PEM play a critical role in fuel cell operation.

The membrane must exhibit high ionic conductivity, zero electronic conductivity, good dimensional stability

and mechanical strength, a resistance to dehydration, and chemical stability towards oxidation, reduction and

hydrolysis. Recent research trends in PEMFCs are moving towards zero external humidification, meaning that

internally the humidity is <50 %RH. However, current membranes are severely sensitive to changes in relative

humidity to the extent that conductive membranes that can generate high current densities under ambient

external humidity do not exisit.

This project is aimed at preparing proton conducting membranes for the micro-fuel cell sectorthat operate

under low relative humidity and are insensitive to changes in ambient humidity. The premise of this project is

that such membranes can be obtained by using high ion exchange capacity polymers that possess limited

swelling. The design, synthesis, and characterization of proton conducting polymers and membranes form the

basis of this project.

"This research program aims to characterize the expansion history of the universe, probe the initial conditions of the early universe, detect the first sources of light in the universe through their environmental impact, and better understand how galaxies form.



While the work will be primarily theoretical, it will be done in close collaboration with large international projects in which the PI is involved. One of these is the South Pole Telescope, a 10m mm-wave telescope operating at the South Pole; a primary science goal is to use this telescope to trace large scale structure in the universe as a function of cosmic time as a way to measure the expansion rate as a function of time, while at the same time measuring the cosmic microwave background at unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution. On a longer timescale, the PI is interested in understanding the science that can be done with upcoming radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometer Array, a proposed large collection of telescopes operating at radio frequencies that together have a square kilometer of collecting area. This instrument will be a sensitive probe of the first sources of light in the universe, and will also provide details on how galaxies form on a range of mass scales, spanning from dwarf galaxies

"As the operation of the LHC looms near, the number of new physics models being seriously considered has never been greater. New physics is needed to complete our picture of the unification of the two of the four forces of nature as described by the decades old standard model of electroweak interactions. The symmetry breaking inherent in this description requires the appearance of a new mass scale, but there has been no confirmed understanding of the origin of this mass scale. At about three orders of magnitude lower in energy than the electroweak scale is the mass scale of QCD, describing a third fundamental force of nature. With QCD nature provides an example of how a mass scale can have a dynamical origin in a strongly interacting gauge theory. Surpisingly, most proposals for the origin of the electroweak mass scale differ significantly from the QCD example. The popular proposals involve concepts that have not yet been seen in nature (elementary scalar fields, superpartners, extra dimensions, string theories, etc.). My research pursues a more conservative approach, more in line with clues provided by QCD. I will continue to elaborate on the signals that this may imply for LHC physics and I will continue to study the related implications for the remaining questions of mass and flavor. An intriguing possibility is the idea that strong gauge interactions also underly gravitation, the fourth force of nature. This is through the phenomenon of ""induced gravity"", and it requires a better understanding of vacuum energy in theories like massless QCD. Contributing to this understanding are recent results from experiment, lattice studies, and other nonperturbative approaches to low energy QCD.

"The overall objective of this research program is to develop, validate and apply a suite of non-lethal biomarkers of exposure to, and effects of, environmental contaminants in fish. This will be achieved by the undertaking the following tasks: Develop a species specific protocol for applying the innovative and new non-lethal biomarker technique, bioeletrical impedance analysis (BIA), to determining a rapid assessment of fish proximate body composition, specifically lipid and energy density. The BIA technique, which was developed for human health applications, instantaneously measures the resistance and reactance (or capacitance) along the body of the fish, which is then used to quantify body lipid and energy levels. Initial work will focus on creating calibration equations for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) and Florida flagfish (Jordanella floridae). Validation will involve lipid and calorimetric measurements to be made using lethal sampling to develop appropriate mathematical models for each species. Application of non-lethal biomarker techniques will then be undertaken to assess the biochemical and bioenergetic impacts of toxicant exposure to fish in the laboratory. Correlations between altered blood enzyme biomarkers and bioenergetics will be made in relation to specific doses and time following exposure. Field biomonitoring using caged-fish populations held in regions of varying contaminant levels will be done to measure the bioenergetic costs of detoxification and acclimation over time. This novel information will result in increased understanding of the impacts of contaminants on the physiology and health of fish populations. Finally, calibration equations for a wider range of local freshwater fish species will be created to permit fish community bioenergetic studies to be undertaken. Thus, this research program will enhance efforts to rapidly assess condition of fish species in the wild as well as in laboratory situtations, and to permit more precise understanding of the bioenergetics of contaminant exposure on different spatial and temporal scales. Development and validation of this non-lethal BIA technique will increase our ability to manage important fish populaions for the benefit of all Canadians.

"Dry fermented sausages are unique among processed meat products because they are manufactured without heat processing and are shelf-stable at room temperature. They are prepared world-wide and their size, different meat and spices, flavour and texture reflect their national origin (eg. Genoa, Hungarian and some types of pepperoni). In 1994 it was found that E.coli O157:H7 (often responsible for human illness and death from consumption of contaminated ground beef), survived in dry sausages. Products from several countries, including Canada were involved in illness outbreaks and recalls occurred. Manufacturing guidelines were revised, and of several processing options approved, only cooking could assure the mandated 5 log unit reduction in E.coli O157:H7 viability would be achieved. However, cooking causes undesirable flavour and texture changes. A natural non-thermal process to eliminate E.coli O157:H7 from sausages would be of great value to the industry. It is also significant that little is known about the food safety risks associated with dry cured hams (proscuitto, Westphalian). Work proposed will establish that thermally treated yellow mustard seed fractions normally used as a neutrally flavoured extender in many cooked processed meats becomes actively antimicrobial in dry cured (raw) fermented sausage and dry cured ham. It is hypothesized that meat hydrolytic enzymes convert the glucosinolate sinalbin in mustard to the active agent p-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate (PHBIT). This compound is mildly flavoured, non-volatile and is not formed in cooked cured meats because hydrolytic enzymes in both meat and mustard are heat denatured. In raw dry sausage and hams it is believed hydrolysis occurs or other compounds or reactions are responsible for generating considerable anti-E.coli O157:H7 activity. The work proposed will investigate this phenomenon and confirm the value in using what is called deheated (not hot) mustard fractions in a new way to eliminate E.coli O157:H7 from uncooked fermented meat products.","Manufacturing processes and products","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Food and Bioproducts"

"This study will use upper mantle fragments, or xenoliths, from lamprophyres associated with the world's oldest in situ diamond deposits to investigate the formation of the 2.7 Ga lithosphere. The xenoliths were permeated by hydrous fluids prior to emplacement and therefore are a window into both the composition of the upper mantle and the nature of metasomatic processes during orogeny. The volatile-rich lamprophyres were emplaced at the same time as nearby gold deposits. Understanding the origin and distribution of deep fluid plumbing systems recorded in the xenoliths will resolve the mechanisms responsible for gold mineralisation and will provide an improved understanding of the links between tectonics and metasomatism. These results will have significant implications for the development of ore deposit models and will potentially lead to new discoveries.

"Concerns about the adverse health effects associated with exposure to environmental contaminants have been increasing globally.  In recent years it has been suggested that the epidemic of Type 2 is due to lifestyle changes associated with industrialization and a more ""modern"" society.  However industrialization is also associated with an increased exposure to synthetic chemicals associated with consumer goods, industrial and agricultural practices.  It has therefore been suggested that chemicals in the environment may contribute to the development of diabetes.  It is true that elevated levels of some environmental chemicals have been measured in people with diabetes but this does not prove that the chemical exposure causes the disease.  The goal of this project is to determine whether chemicals that are commonly found in our environment can affect the function of the pancreas and therefore be related to the development of type 2 diabetes.  This project will use insulin secreting pancreatic beta cells to determine if a wide variety of commonly encountered chemicals present in the environment can impair the normal function of these cells and/or cause the beta cells to die.  I will also investigate whether the developing pancreas (fetus or newborn) is more susceptible to these chemical insults than the adult pancreas.  We will also determine whether these chemicals are all acting through a common pathway to cause damage to the pancreas and attempt to find ways to prevent or reduce the effects of this exposure.  The results from this study will determine whether toxic chemicals in the environment are capable of causing metabolic endocrine disruption in animal and human populations.  These results will also be important to determine whether chemicals in the environment are contributing to the increased rates of type 2 diabetes around the world.

"Trailing vortices are an inherent feature of aircraft flight and are primarily responsible for the swirling air motions observed in an aircraft wake. They present an in-flight hazard to aircraft and therefore place constraints on flight paths and the timing of take-off and landings at airports. Trailing vortices also have a strong influence on the dispersion of jet engine exhaust pollutants and  pesticides in aerial spray applications. There is a substantial ongoing research effort to predict and, if possible, control the development of trailing vortices. Generally the objective is to limit vortex longevity by exciting the inherent modes of instability that exist within them. There has been extensive theoretical study of these instabilities but relatively few attempts to directly test for their presence in the laboratory. In spite of this fact many devices have been proposed to limit vortex longevity and some have been moderately successful. One device that has demonstrated the ability to reduce the rate of swirl velocity and increase the rate of vortex diffusion is spanwise directed air jets mounted on the wing tips. The present research proposal is to conduct laboratory testing on a trailing vortex formed with tip jets and identify the modes of vortex instability excited and the subsequent coherent structures of vortex break-up that they produce. A comparison will then be made between the findings of this study and the existing theories of vortex instability with the expectation that the phenomenon can be better understood. In particular it may be possible to reduce the energy required to achieve vortex break-up if the disturbance is more precisely designed. The experimental methods used will include flow imaging and  advanced pattern recognition techniques. Once identified attempts will also be made to model the effect of these ""coherent structures""  on vortex development. Ultimately an improved understanding of vortex dynamics will lead to more effective vortex control.

"This is a request for a quantitative imaging system.  The equipment requested will be shared among six laboratories, in which a total of approximately 23 highly qualified individuals are currently being trained.  The main function of the requested equipment is for the quantitative determination of proteins, a technique known as Western blotting.  This technique has become the cornerstone of analytical/mechanistic research, and therefore is absolutely essential for each collaborators independent research program.



This requested quantitative imaging system provides accurate quantitative determination of proteins in various biological systems (muscle, cells, adipose etc.). In combination with other research techniques, the requested equipment will enable us to accurately measure the total amount of specific proteins, as well as further characterize protein location and function. This equipment will be used in 'basic science' to identify the role(s) of novel proteins in regulating skeletal muscle and adipose tissue (fat cells) metabolism. This basic knowledge will be applied to studying the development of metabolic dysfunction, which are often found in selected diseases (obesity, diabetes and cancer), as well as determine how therapeutic interventions (drugs, diet and exercise) exert their effects. State of the art molecular biology approaches will also be used to over-and under-express various proteins to better determine their roles in the development of various diseases, as well as their utility as therapeutic targets in treatment regimes.



In all of the applicants' research programs the necessity of determining changes in protein concentrations is absolute, and therefore the requested equipment is indispensable. Beyond the immediate six laboratory groups, it is expected that the equipment will benefit the entire Department of Human Health and Nutritional Sciences (representing 22 faculty and 87 HQP).

"Skeletal muscle uses both fat and carbohydrates as energy sources during exercise and everyday living.  Mitochondria are structures located within skeletal muscle that are responsible for harvesting the energy from fat and carbohydrate, allowing our muscles to contract.  While the regulation of carbohydrate breakdown resulting in energy is well characterized, little is known about the regulation of fat breakdown.  Scientists do know that specific proteins, called transport proteins, help get the fat inside the mitochondria where they are broken down to create energy. This transport into mitochondria, likely involving several transport proteins, appears to be key step in regulating the overall rate that skeletal muscle can breakdown fat.  However the exact details of how fat gets into mitochondria, which proteins facilitate the transport of fat, and what regulates these transport proteins is currently not known.  



Recent advances in analytical techniques allow researchers to either 'put-in' or 'take-out' specific proteins in skeletal muscle to study the affect on fat breakdown.  These approaches will allow us to determine the role for each potential transport protein in the regulation of fat breakdown. 



In addition, we will use exercise as a means to increase the rate fat is broken down for energy. We will then study the changes in these transport proteins (the amount and location), and use chemicals that mimic exercise to determine the important signaling events (eg. calcium, or a by-product of energy usage (AMP)) that either change the amount, location and/or activity of these transport proteins.



The understanding of these transport proteins has implications for everyday living and exercise, as well for situations where fat breakdown is decreased, like aging, obesity and insulin resistance.

"In the past 540 million years, sea level has been much higher than today, causing large areas of the paleocontinents to be submerged.  If submergence occurred when a continent was near the equator, limestones were deposited.  The seas have long since retreated from the continents, but the limestones remain.  Inside the limestones there are geochemical clues in the form of isotopic fingerprints that we can use to understand the nature of the Earth's past environment and climate. By making our measurements in stratigraphic successions of ancient marine limestones we can track the evolution of the Earth's environment and climate over time.  The isotopic fingerprints tell us about the ancient carbon cycle and greenhouse effect, sea level, and seawater circulation patterns in epicontinental seas, temperature, and salinity of marine waters. This type of information informs our thinking and models on the relationship between climate and sea level circulation patterns, or climate and continental weathering rates in the past. And it bears on the debate regarding the impact of anthropogenic carbon dioxide on contemporary global warming. My work is focused on refining interpretations of carbon isotope records through time, developing models of ancient carbon cycling, and advancing the application of isotope tracers like neodymium, which I have found to be related to sea level changes in the past. New research will add significantly to this repertoire of isotopic tools; including, for the first time, a proxy indicator of dissolved oxygen levels in ancient seawater-stable isotope variations of uranium and chromium. The behavior of uranium and chromium isotopes will be first studied in modern environments. This will involve sampling ocean waters, stratified waters in coastal seas, and even a modern stratified lake with no dissolved oxygen in the bottom waters. These modern studies will characterize the range of chromium and uranium isotope fractionation in modern systems, and the processes that control the isotope fractionations. These findings will inform on the utility of uranium and chromium isotope fingerprints in ancient marine sediments as tools for tracking changing oxygen levels in the earth's shallow seas and oceans over time.

"My research aims to develop scientific understanding and improved algorithms in the areas of machine learning, and heuristic search, and to explore practical applications of techniques in these areas.



A machine learning algorithm uses training data, or past experience, to improve its performance at a specific task.  In my research the task is playing poker against a single opponent, and machine learning will be used to identify the opponent's strengths and weaknesses and adapt its play accordingly in order to maximize its winnings against this specific opponent. This is very challenging because learning must be very rapid (only 100-200 hands will be played against this opponent in total), and the information available to the learning algorithm is noisy and incomplete.



A heuristic search algorithm is a fast method for finding optimal paths between two nodes in a graph.  For example, if the graph is a road map, a heuristic search algorithm could be used to quickly find the shortest route from your current location to a particular destination.  Heuristic search is faster than standard methods because it uses an estimate of the distance to the goal, called a heuristic function.  My research investigates various ways of speeding up heuristic search.  One of the methods I am investigating is to decompose the heuristic function into the sum of a set of smaller heuristic functions. My aim is to understand when this is possible, and when it is superior to other methods.  I am also investigating techniques for predicting how much speedup will be produced by a given heuristic function.

"Environmental pollutants are resistant to biodegradation, accumulate in the food chain and affect various biological functions. Dioxin-type chemicals interfere with steroid hormone action and impair reproductive functions. There is increasing evidence that prenatal exposure to dioxin-type environmental chemicals results in long-term reproductive disturbances in the offspring of exposed mothers and even in further generations. The molecular mechanisms underlying these heritable reproductive dysfunctions are not fully understood. The proposed research will investigate the molecular mechanisms induced by these chemicals using unique cell models and transgenic mice. Utilizing immortalized cells of female reproductive organs we will study the impact of these chemicals on the functional differentiation of epithelial cells which is regulated under the influence of estrogen and progesterone. We hypothesize that dioxin-type chemicals interfere with molecular mechanisms essential for secretory and resorptive functions. Using dioxin-responsive mouse models we will determine the most sensitive time windows for dioxin exposure during pre- and post-natal development. We will employ modern fluorescence imaging techniques and novel highly sensitive detection and analysis techniques to investigate extra-chromosomal DNA sequences and alterations in microRNA patterns following pre-natal exposure to dioxin. Our long-term goal is to identify the mechanisms of genome dynamics which may confer heritable functional reproductive disorders.

"The detailed chemical interactions that occur between molecules are important in how molecules recognize, bind to and even alter other molecules, including metals.  These interactions occur every time two molecules encounter each other such as when a pharmaceutical drug binds to a biological site on a human cell.  In addition, these interactions are used by a variety of inorganic and biological (enzyme) catalysts to produce chemical change in materials.  Our research attempts to add to our fundamental knowledge in this area by studying and probing these interactions at the biochemical level.  Investigations into the parameters important for protein structure and protein-substrate, protein-metal and protein-protein interactions are being undertaken in our project.  As well, we are concerned with the application of chemistry to understanding how biochemical catalysts (enzymes) specifically bind and rapidly catalyze chemical reactions.  This type of information, although fundamental, has very broad implications in biochemistry and in the pharmaceutical area where the knowledge of a chemical mechanism of an enzyme in a pathogenic organism could be utilized to provide a molecular Achilles heel for the development of new drugs.  Our particular approach has also required that we be able to introduce our chemical probes into the macromolecule itself, and so, as chemists, we have had to also learn the language and techniques of molecular biology.  The ability of chemistry to provide tailor-made molecules to serve as tools in probing biological processes is critical to our goal of  understanding biochemical systems in terms of chemical structure.  In essence, this research program utilizes a combined chemical and biochemical approach to probe the importance of the carbon-sulfur bond in biological systems.  New discoveries in these areas are expected to ameliorate our fundamental knowledge of molecular recognition events, chemical mechanisms of enzymes and the underlying chemistry of metal selection and activation by proteins.

"Recently, there has been a growing demand for a small but high power source of energy for portable devices. The current battery technology can hardly meet this growing power demand. A recent comparison between Li-ion batteries and fuel cells has shown that the latter have much higher power density and hence more potential to respond to the future supply and demand. Further, miniaturization of the fuel cells can increase their power density by increasing the surface-to-volume ratio.  Technological and physical issues, however, restrict the miniaturization process. This has motivated the emergence of microfluidic fuel cells as a new generation of the fuel cell technology. Microfluidic fuel cells take advantage of laminar flow in a microchannel to keep the fuel and oxidant separate. Therefore, the membrane is no longer required for fuel and oxidant separation, and hence, the membrane-related issues are eliminated. However, the power density and fuel utilization of these devices have not been fully optimized for current portable applications. The efficiency of these devices is limited due to 1) the depletion of reactants at the vicinity of the activation site, and 2) mixing of the fuel and oxidant because of the diffusion phenomenon. It has been shown that the microchannel geometry has a significant effect on these factors. Through multiphysics modeling, the applicant and her group have introduced an innovative geometry which significantly enhances the cell power and fuel utilization compared to the existing geometries. Also, the group has designed and developed a prototype based on the proposed geometry and now needs to evaluate the performance through experiments. To conduct these experiments, the applicant requires 1) a potentionstat device to measure the cell power while maintaining the potential across the cell constant, and 2) a pump system to inject the reactants into the microchannel at tightly controlled flow rates. The applicant's Fuel Cell Research Laboratory is equipped with the fabrication facility required to build the microchannel. The proposed equipment will facilitate the measurement of the fuel cell power and fuel utilization which will be compared to the results obtained from modeling.","Alternative energy resources","Mechanical Engineering"
"In the past century, there has been a dramatic climate change due to the greenhouse effect mainly caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Also, despite public awareness through extensive media coverage, emissions from industry and motor vehicles are still the main cause of air pollution that claims thousands of lives in Canada every year according to Health Canada. The primary cause of both climate change and air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels. In view of these problems, alternative sources of energy must be explored. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells have drawn much attention in the last decade as a high-efficiency and low-emission source of energy. However, the performance and cost of the PEM fuel cells must be improved significantly before they can constitute a viable market. One of the major problems of the current PEM fuel cells is water management. The polymer membrane of the PEM fuel cell needs to be well hydrated to maintain proton conductivity. However, excessive water vapor condensation, due to a long operation or large output current, forms micro-droplets that block the access of the reactant gas to the reaction site. The improvement of water management requires the study of droplet formation and liquid water transport in the internal network of the fuel cell. The proposed research program involves the study of three mechanisms: 1) micro-droplet formation on different layers of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), 2) liquid water transport in the gas diffusion layer (GDL), and 3) droplet agglomeration at the GDL/flow channel interface. To gain better insight into these mechanisms, it is required to determine the effect of interfacial and capillary forces on droplet formation and liquid transport in the PEM fuel cell. Experimental methodologies will be developed under this research program to determine 1) the local interfacial properties of the micro-droplets in the MEA, 2) the wettability of the GDL, and 3) the interfacial properties of the droplets at the GDL/flow channel interface. This work will result in the enhancement of water management in the PEM fuel cells and hence contribute to the strengthening of Canadian fuel cell technology.","Alternative energy resources","Mechanical Engineering - B"

"In spite of developments in concrete technology, concrete in extreme environments continues to prematurely deteriorate. In part this results from inadequate specifications or construction methods, but it also results from a lack of understanding of all the factors which influence durability. The pore structure and resultant fluid penetration resistance of the cement paste matrix and paste-aggregate interfacial regions govern the durability of concrete to most causes of distress. In this proposal, these properties will continue to be studied with applications to resistance to: chloride ingress, reinforcement corrosion, freezing and thawing in the presence of de-icer salts, alkali-aggregate reactions, and sulphate resistance. Other aspects of durability such as crack resistance (to thermal and moisture related shrinkage) and improved durability- based performance specifications are also being studied.



Specifically there are several areas of research focus: 1) characterizing pore structure and fluid transport through concrete, including development and standardization of test methods. 2) prediction of performance of fresh and early-age properties of cementitious materials-chemical admixture combinations. 3) effects of different de-icing chemicals on concrete integrity, alkali-silica reaction resistance, and salt-scaling. 4) minimizing volume change and inproving crack resistance of concrete. 5) improvements to evaluation of residual service life of concretes exposed to chloride environments. 6) implementation of test methods and practices in codes and standards.



The impact on HQP will be training of 2 PhD's and 7-8 MASc students over the next five years and will encourage graduate studies for the 5 undergraduate summer research assistants.  While these figures will be augmented with student travel from other sources of funding, the NSERC funds are critically important.

"The world in which contemporary organizations operate is uncertain and rapidly changing.  Organizations depend on the software in their business systems to give them the flexibility to cope with this volatility and retain their competitive advantage.  The high-performance high-quality software development organizations that produce this software use agile development methods.  These methods develop software incrementally in close collaboration with the customer.  With agile, the purpose of the software, and the software itself evolve simultaneously.  Users do not have to wait until software is fully finished before they can start using it, and can change their requirements as new business opportunities arise.



Modern software is complex, and seemingly simple changes can break it.  Agile methods cope with this through continuous testing.  Code and tests are developed concurrently, and tests are run automatically to validate that the software meets customer expectations.  However, certain kinds of critical requirements, such as ""orders are shipped only after payment"", cannot be completely tested.  Instead, a more formal approach is needed based on careful mathematical specification and reasoning about the software.  But formality is in general quite expensive, and unless it is lightweight and automated, it can interfere with the rapid change that is necessary in agile development.



The goal of this project is to make agile development better by incorporating additional formal techniques and their associated automatic checking.  This way we maintain the flexibility offered by agile development while gaining the greater confidence offered by formal reasoning.
