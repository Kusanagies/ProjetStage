"Shale gas is an increasingly important source of hydrocarbons for the petroleum industry.  The ability to exploit the gas held in mudstones is dependent upon the sediment fabric being suitable to allow movement of hydrocarbons within the host-sediment.  One of the most significant factors controlling sediment fabric in mudstones is the distribution of burrows that can either create porous zones or destroy them.  Fractures, both natural and hydraulically induced, link the pores and allow gas to be produced from the shale.



This 5 year study will aim to directly assess the impact that different types of burrows have on the host sediment through careful 3D imaging of sediment fabrics and burrow shape.  The ultimate aim of which will be to make first order predictions relating to the distribution of porosity in fine-grained rocks and improve the exploitation of this valuable resource.

"The ability of the human central nervous system (CNS) to control upright stance is essential to the success of activities of daily life including the ability to walk.  The control of balance is characterized by a continuous monitoring and defending against disturbances in order to prevent the occurrence of a fall.  Such reactions, triggered by the occurrence of a disturbance to balance, are the ultimate defense against instability. Fortunately, there is a rich body of literature that has characterized the features of such reactions. The hallmarks of these reactions are their rapid speed of onset and execution while preserving appropriate amplitude and direction of movement. The 'temporal urgency' of such reactions place unique control challenges on both CNS and neuromuscular systems.  Such challenges are the likely reason for the high prevalence of disrupted compensatory balance reactions following neurologic or musculoskeletal injury.  



While much is understood about the characteristics of such compensatory balance reactions there really is very little known about the underlying central nervous system control in humans.  Better understanding the control of this behaviour is the next important step that may help to contribute to improved diagnostic and therapeutic techniques.  The focus of the proposed program of study is to continue ongoing work to advance understanding of the underlying central nervous system control of dynamic stability.  The work uses advanced neuroimaging and electrophysiology techniques coupled with measures of balance recovery to assess the role of specific parts of the central nervous system.  This work will further our understanding of the control of balance to provide knowledge to help develop new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques for those with damage to their CNS and at risk of falling (e.g. stroke, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, dementia).

"Very reactive compounds are often extremely useful - they're used extensively as catalysts as well as crucial ingredients in many chemical reactions. However, this reactivity can make such compounds tough to study. This proposal requests a compact, relatively inexpensive chamber - a ""glovebox"" - to handle samples while

they are being prepared for analysis using mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry is an astonishingly fast and sensitive technique, but the small amounts of material used, if highly reactive, can easily be decomposed by even trace quantities of water and oxygen. The glovebox will solve this problem, reducing the water and oxygen content of the box to less than one part per million by replacing it with inert nitrogen gas. Interfacing the box with a mass spectrometer will allow rapid and routine analysis of new compounds, allowing us to study previously inaccessible chemistry.","Polymers, rubber and plastics","University of Victoria",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","Chimie m�tallique et organo-m�tallique","Chimie inorganique"
"Mass spectrometry is a highly sensitive technique that enables the rapid analysis of complex mixtures. All sorts of molecules can be analysed, from volatile organic compounds to massive biomolecules. However, there are some classes of compound that are resistant to analysis because they may be non-polar and: (a) of high molecular weight; (b) paramagnetic; (c) highly air- and moisture-sensitive. Conventional ionization techniques serve these classes of compound poorly, and four researchers at UVic seek to address this weakness by purchasing Canada's first Liquid Introduction Field Desorption Ionization (LIFDI) source. This new technology transforms a practically obsolete, experimentally inconvenient technique (FDI) into a fast, modern means of analyzing materials and providing molecular weight and compositional information on compounds that have proved resistant to other means of characterization. As such, all four applicants expect to be able to not only greatly facilitate and expand their current research but also to rapidly break new ground unexplored by them and others in areas as diverse as direct analysis of complex biodiesel mixtures, characterization of polysilane oligomers and paramagnetic lanthanide complexes, and the determination of the molecular structure of metal complexes of stable radicals.

The proposed source is a highly cost-effective method to access new chemistry; typically, a development such as this one would involve purchase of an entirely new instrument, but LIFDI is compatible with any modern instrument and can be swapped on and off with relative ease.","Polymers, rubber and plastics","University of Victoria",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)",Catalyse,"Chimie inorganique"

"Catalysts speed up reactions. In doing so, they play a crucial role in making chemical processes faster, cleaner and more energy-efficient. Indeed, without catalysts, many chemical transformations are simply not possible. Despite their enormous importance, studying catalysts is difficult. Their very nature implies that they are highly reactive and present at very low concentration; capturing and studying such transient species is challenging. The ideal technique to use is one that is fast, extremely sensitive, and capable of dealing with complex mixtures. In electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), just such a technique exists, but applying it to catalytic problems is not easy. We are leading innovators in this field, developing new methodology and original approaches to make ESI-MS a leading catalyst discovery tool for chemists. We design and synthesize ligands that render otherwise invisible catalysts highly prominent - turning the task of finding the proverbial needle in a haystack into a trivial matter by effectively making only the needles visible. We take our toolkit and apply it imaginatively to problems in catalyst characterization that have proved intractable to other spectroscopic techniques. In doing so, we find out fundamental information on the identity of the intermediates, resting states and decomposition products. These data allow us to pursue new improved catalysts for a wide range of commercially-relevant processes, from the synthesis of fine chemicals, plastics and even biodiesel.

Specifically, tools and techniques will be developed for object extraction and modeling, visual comparison of two objects, object feature emphasis, object manipulation in 3D, object measurement and annotation, tracking changes in objects, object interrelationship analysis, volume image navigation, and sharing and recording of multimedia diagnostic reports and surgical plans. The integration of user collaboration mechanisms is also a major focus, allowing multiple users to view and interact with the image data or with diagnostic reports.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","Ryerson University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Infographie,"Technologie de l'information"
"Ecosystems worldwide are changing dramatically because of changing climate, habitat fragmentation, introduced species and changing management goals. As a result, plants and animals likely will need to disperse longer distances than previously in order to find suitable habitats. It is unclear how successful species dispersal will be in these new environments and our predictions of their movements are poor at best. To provide predictions for managers, scientists, and the public, this research will examine dispersal and movement of three important species, whitebark pine (WBP), white spruce, and wolves as well as reproductive effort of WBP.

  Whitebark pine is a high elevation keystone species in the western mountains of North America. It is currently in decline due to an invasive disease, human-driven fire suppression and a climate that is dramatically improving the conditions for the devastating mountain pine beetle. In this research, I will examine the potential for this species to produce enough seeds and disperse to recreate healthy forests of whitebark pine.

  White spruce, a dominant species in the boreal forests of North America, colonizes areas that have had recent forest fires. Currently, it appears that white spruce has not been recolonizing recent burns in South central Yukon, and this may be due to a combination of changing climate and dispersal problems. I will examine dispersal in conjunction with climate factors to tease apart the reasons for the apparent lack of success and to anticipate future changes in currently, formerly and potentially white spruce forests.

  In many places in the world, large carnivores are recolonizing with direct or indirect assistance by humans. For example, wolves in the North America and Europe are recolonizing many areas after decades of being absent due to hunting. While there are people both for and against the recolonization, most people are interested in determining where and when they will disperse, what their impacts will be, and how to manage them. I will use state-of-the-art GPS collars combined with modern modeling tools to anticipate their dispersal into new areas to allow for human communities to anticipate the potential impacts.

"The objective of my research has been to develop methods that can be used to understand the changes to metal surfaces caused by oxidation and corrosion. During the past five years in particular my group has devoted much of its efforts to the refinement of the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique to permit both 

quantitative measurement of the oxide thickness and distribution(s), as well as the chemical nature of the oxidation products. During that period, we have made substantial progress in describing oxide growth mechanisms on iron, nickel and iron-chromium alloysunder gas phase conditions .We propose to extend this to include studies in water under high pressure that simulates conditions in nuclear steam generators. As Principal Investigator for the VESPERS beamline at the Canadian Light Source, I have spent considerable time in its development and construction over the past several years. Now, with the beamline finally in operation, our group will begin to use its capability for measuring micro-Laue diffraction patterns of surfaces under 

mechanical strain. Thus, we will measure patterns of elastic strain and the density and direction of dislocations (associated with inelastic strain) that result from corrosion of the same iron-chromium-nickel alloys whose oxidation processes as we are also studying by XPS. The combined information will allow a better understanding of the mechanisms of degradative failure of these alloys, such as stress corrosion cracking. Such work will be directly applicable to the understanding of degradation processes in the steam generator tubing of

"Solvents like toluene are widely abused by Canadian children and adolescents to achieve a euphoric state; toluene is also a toxic compound present in specific Canadian workplaces associated with the lumber, printing or painting industries.  The behavioural changes and ultimately the long-term addiction that follows self-administration of these chemicals are likely related to acute and chronic modifications of brain function.  The exact mechanisms by which toluene modifies brain function are incompletely understood, although one hypothesis is that these chemicals acutely and chronically modify the electrical (ion channels and action potentials) and chemical (neurotransmitters and synapses) signals that specific types of brain cells in specific regions of the brain use to transmit and store information. The research program of Dr. McKay is dedicated to addressing this hypothesis.  Dr. McKay is interested in identifying the ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors that mediate the effects of the abused solvent toluene in neurons of the brain essential for specific types of learning.  Given that toluene is often abused by very young children, Dr. McKay is further interested in assessing the potential differential vulnerability of young brains compared to mature brains to the long-term effects of toluene.  The research program will provide highly qualified personnel the opportunity to use state-of-the-art electrophysiology and imaging tools to integrate across multiple levels of discourse from single ion channels to neurons to networks of neurons and ultimately to behaviour, thereby providing them with the specificity and breadth of knowledge and skills to prepare them for careers in academia, industry and government in Canada and elsewhere.  The research will pursue novel hypothesis-driven studies and answer questions that will interest many scientists who study how abused drugs / chemicals change brain function, and may one day be helpful for the numerous Canadians who very early in their lives begin to abuse chemicals like toluene or are exposed to toluene in their workplaces.

"Canada's health care system is faced by many challenges, one of which is the effective and efficient use of key resources such as operating rooms. Operating rooms do not work in isolation and are constrained and guided by environmental factors such as pre- and post-op resources, and by decoupled decision-making between surgeons and the hospital. The latter is a key element of the planning and scheduling problem: the hospitals develop a blocking pattern which the surgeons then use, with the hospitals later taking control of the sequencing of elective and emergency surgery. The situation is characterized by extreme uncertainty, and relatively high variance is pervasive. This creates challenges at both levels of planning: blocking and detailed sequencing. 



The proposed research takes an integrated view of the situation in order to understand the types and nature of the causes of instability. Once isolated and codified, the factors and heuristics for dealing with risk are analysed and aspects of the situation modeled. These models help to understand the dynamic relationships and also help to guide the crafting of more robust schedules.

"A hallmark of many viral infections is the production of foreign nucleic acid molecules generated during the viral life cycle. Cellular proteins that detect invasion through the recognition of viral nucleic acid molecules allow host cells to mount an immune response. At the heart of this recognition event are the molecular features of the protein-nucleic acid complexes that allow for successful interaction to occur. The McKenna laboratory is principally concerned with understanding the interactions between viral nucleic acid molecules and 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) enzymes, a family of nucleic-acid binding proteins that prevent viral replication by blocking necessary viral protein production. The McKenna laboratory will establish a research program to understand, at the molecular level, the features of naturally occurring viral nucleic acid molecules that are specifically recognized by this family of enzymes. Biophysical and structural biology approaches will be used to characterize OAS-nucleic acid complexes, and help understand how these enzymes distinguish between viral and host-cell nucleic acid molecules. A crucial starting point for this research program is the development of strategies to produce and isolate protein and nucleic acid materials of high yield and purity.  The requested Fast Performance Liquid Chromatography system outlined in this proposal will be the central device used to purify large quantities of these reagents, and is required equipment in modern structural biology laboratories.  With the acquisition of the requested equipment, the McKenna laboratory will place itself at the cutting edge of the nucleic acid isolation field for use in structural biology applications. Given the important roles that nucleic acid molecules play in biological systems and the biotechnology field, the inclusion of a Fast Performance Liquid Chromatography system into an already multidisciplinary training environment will result in the training of highly qualified personnel who are well equipped for careers in science.","Medical and health sciences","University of Manitoba",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)",Enzymes,Biochimie
"Polymers, and polymer-based materials are found in almost every corner of modern life. Their attractiveness comes not only from their relatively low cost, but also from the quasi-infinite number of ways in which the basic components can be put together to obtain new, useful properties.  It is therefore no longer sufficient simply to understand the chemistry underlying polymerisations, but rather it is essential to know how to manipulate molecular structure of these materials in situ.  Doing so provides manufacturers with innovative processes for advanced materials and adds value (commercial and social) to polymer products.

          The motivation for my research programme is to be innovative in the development of new or better processes for the production of polymeric materials.  To accomplish this, it is important to understand issues on a molecular scale (e.g. what influences the reactivity of the active centres from which individual molecules grow?), supramolecular scale (e.g. interfacial phenomena, particle morphology), and on the reactor scale (e.g.quantification and control of rates and properties, reactor design, agitation...).

          The programme is thus pluridisciplinary.  It will focus on polymerisation with different fundamental chemistries, but that all take place in dispersed phase reactors (the emphasis on dispersed phases is motivated by the need to overcome the energy and operational problems often associated with working with highly viscous melts and solutions).  It covers points like the generation and production of structured particles (internal structure, external shape and the particle size distribution;   innovative reactor and sensor design; fundamental process modelling; the study of nascent polymerisation of olefins on supported catalysts; the relationship between particle morphology and reaction rate; and related topics such as the generation of high solid content systems, dispersed phase rheology.  These projects will be carried out with a number of partners (nationally and internationally), and will involve the training of HQP with the ability to work in many different areas.  4 Ph.D. students and 2 Postdoctoral fellows will be recruited during this 5 year project.

"The entrainment and transport of particles by wind occurs on all continents of the Earth. Arid to semi-arid regions are principally affected, although sites disturbed by agriculture, mining and construction activities also are subject to deflation and reduced soil fertility, as well as, poor air quality. Wind erosion in Canada is unique as compared to the hot deserts and grasslands of other countries in the sense that many northern areas affected are seasonally cold and dry, though humid in summer. Similarly, biotic crusts flourish on expansive coastal beaches that are considerably windier than continental deserts. In effect, very little of what scientists currently know about the transport of particles by wind in hot, arid regions well applies to high latitude, cold regions. This research program aims to understand and quantify the degree to which aeolian processes are affected by constraints on the supply of particles from a given surface to the airflow; as for example, the presence of crusts, high humidity, pore ice, and non-erodible roughness elements. The Trent Environmental Wind Tunnel (TEWT) is the only facility in the world at present where the transport of sedimentary particles is studied over a systematically varied range of temperature and humidity, inclusive of winter time conditions. Work in this facility complements that of field scientists, but has the advantage that the time required to study such environmental controls is significantly compressed. Natural wind erosion events are notoriously unpredictable and intermittent, so that it is difficult to carry out field experiments with a high degree of spatial and temporal resolution. Wind tunnel simulation allows researchers to study the underlying physics of the phenomena using particle tracking velocimetry (PTV); as for example, as well as to carry out detailed vertical and horizontal profiling of the turbulent airflow properties. Over the long term, the goal of this research program is to comprehend more fully the range of conditions under which wind erosion occurs on a global scale, and to contribute to improvements in the development and parametrization of existing sediment transport models.

"The NSERC Discovery Grant Proposal is to fund a new, student-centered hydrogeology research program in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at McGill University. There are still many uncertainties regarding how future climate warming will affect northern hydrogeology, including the effects on permafrost melting and northern peatlands. The proposed research has three interrelated objectives: a) developing a combined groundwater flow and heat transport model with freeze-thaw processes, b) developing a better understanding of the interaction of surface water (e.g. streams) with the groundwater system, including the role of seasonal freezing, and c) studying the complex interaction of regional groundwater flow, permafrost, and northern peatlands.

The groundwater model development will further enhance the pre-existing SUTRA-ICE code, and will include unsaturated freezing functionality, an improved temperature-density relationship, a specified cryostatic pressure component, and a formalized land-surface boundary condition. Model benchmarking and inter-model comparison studies will validate the new model. Groundwater-surface water interactions will be studied at the large watershed scale, and will utilize temperature as a natural tracer combined with novel groundwater models. Initially the proposed research will take place at the Mt. St. Hillaire Nature Reserve, Quebec. Northern peatland and permafrost hydrogeology will be studied through fieldwork in the Hudson Bay Lowlands and regional groundwater models. The simulations will be used to predict how ongoing global warming will affect regional and local scale groundwater systems.

The requested funds are primarily for graduate student stipends (one PhD student and one Masters student per year), undergraduate research assistants, materials, supplies and conference travel. The proposed research has a strong training component, including undergraduate/ graduate students and visiting researchers.

"The goal of complexity theory is to rigorously classify problems solvable by computers on the basis of the amounts of resources needed to solve them. Computing time is considered as a resource, as well as memory, processors, random bits, communication bits, etc. The methodology of complexity theory rests on the definition of abstract computer models, on the development of algorithms solving a problem on such models, and (ideally) on the mathematical proof that the algorithms found are the best possible. In some cases, such a proof would have great practical value ; for example, the perceived -but as yet unproven- difficulty of problems such as factoring a large number into two smaller numbers that multiply out to this number underlies much of today's cryptography.



The main long-term goal of my research is to make progress in elucidating the structure of the complexity class P of problems solvable in polynomial time. In particular, I will continue to devote effort to the question of whether an arbitrary polynomial time computation can be performed using only a logarithmic amount of memory. This is a 35 year-old open question, and it hints at the main shortcoming of complexity theory : despite intensive efforts by a generation of researchers, very few significant lower bounds on the complexity of specific problems within the complexity class NP are known.



The short-term goal of my work is to use the tools of complexity theory to better understand the complexity of specific problems by (A) comparing this complexity with those of other well studied problems, (B) proving lower bounds on restricted models of computation, and (C) further investigating the connections between algebra, logic and complexity.



In particular, I will further develop and investigate models of computation that are intermediate between the monotone Boolean circuit, for which significant lower bounds are known, and general Boolean circuits, for which lower bounds are mostly inexistant. The new models include the semantic incremental branching program, recently introduced, and a proposed generalisation of monotone span programs which replaces equality constraints by inequalities. Studying such new models offers hope to extend current proof technology and thus move closer to being able to determine the complexity of problems of immediate practical interest.

"The main aim of the proposal is to investigate the role of spine shape heterogeneity and motility in synapse maintenance and plasticity. From this proposal we will gain insight into the functional role of spine motility, the function of heterogeneity in spine shape, transition states between morphological classes of spines and the role of the axon during spine shape changes. Since dendritic spines are assumed to underlie cellular elements of memory, these studies are expected to contribute to our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of learning and memory.



Specific hypotheses include:

1.    )	Thin spines become shaft synapses when deprived of AMPA receptor activation

2.    )	There are coordinated movements between pre- and postsynaptic components of the synapse 

3.    )	AMPA receptor activation is also necessary for spine formation during spinogenesis.

4.    )	Spine motility affects lateral diffusion of the AMPA subtype of  glutamate receptors

5.    )	Spine shape affects diffusion rates of membrane associated proteins and determines the predilection of a synapse for altered plasticity

6.    )	Small GTPase modify the distribution of AMPA receptor molecules in the neuron under different activity.

We combine transgenic lines with subsets of cells labeled with membrane tagged GFP, cultures, paired recordings, molecular tools, dynamic imaging and 3D software for analysis.

"One of the fundamental goals of number theory is to find solutions in whole numbers to certain kinds of equations called Diophantine equations.  These equations can often be interpreted in a geometric manner, and therefore geometric techniques can be brought to bear on the solution of the problem. Paul Vojta has made some wide-ranging conjectures on what kinds of solutions Diophantine equations should have, based on what kind of geometrical  properties the equations have.  In my future research, I propose to study these conjectures, try to improve on my previous proofs of various special cases of them, and try to use existing results to gain further insight into the solutions of Diophantine equations.

"Stability of mining excavations at depth depends on both rock mass strength and stress conditions. Methods of estimating rock mass strength are relatively well developed, but in contrast, stress conditions are generally estimated from data assembled for entire regions. Although there is documented evidence that stresses can be strongly influenced by local geological conditions, the expense and difficulty of carrying out stress measurement programs has all but precluded their use in practice. Even when measurements are made, stress fields used in design analysis invariably have simplified forms. Certain ground control problems in mines, including seismic events located far from mining excavations, cannot be explained using this simple approach. Other less quantifiable design errors are undoubtedly introduced using this simplification.

The applicant has recently shown through analysis of stress measurements that certain upper crustal fault systems are only marginally stable. Further analysis has shown that triggering of seismic events remote from mining excavations is a natural occurrence in these systems, as is the variation in magnitude and direction of the stress field. Since these results are novel, the proposed research focuses on investigating and extending this early work in order to characterize stress fields in complex geological settings typical of mines. The work will be carried out using continuum and discontinuum numerical stress analysis codes, analysis of large databases of stress measurements, microseismic data from mines, plus additional published information on stress fields in relation to structures that is available in the structural geology literature. This research is expected to contribute towards our understanding of stress fields in complex rock masses such as scatter in measurements, seismic activity around mines, fault strength, and the way in which stress fields in numerical stress analyses are specified. Through improved design analysis, mine safety,  layout efficiency and productivity will be increased.

Through this research, training of two Ph.D. level graduate students is anticipated.","Primary metal products (ferrous and non-ferrous)","Queen's University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","M�canique des roches","G�nie minier et min�ral"

"Biological invasions represent one of the gravest threats to species diversity around the world, but also represent a valuable opportunity to better understand vegetation dynamics. Of special interest is why introduced species should behave so differently from populations in their home environments. 

    The focus of this research is Red Bartsia (Odontites vernum or OV), which was introduced to Manitoba in the 1950s and which has spread across North America. As a hemiparasite, it makes opportunistic associations with its hosts. The roles of hemiparasitism and that of disturbance, the absence of natural enemies, and adaptation will be assessed in this research. This ecological focus will be complemented with social research, the latter used to bridge gaps in biological data, especially regarding historical patterns of invasion. 

    The overall objective of this multi-scale research is to better understand the dynamics of a new hemiparasitic invasive. The specific objectives of this research are:

i) to contrast the spatiotemporal dynamics of this invasive at local, regional and cross-continental scales of organization; ii) to identify mechanisms that underlie dynamics at these different scales, specifically the relative contributions of fungal pathogens as enemies, disturbance, and adaptation; and iii) to assess the role of hemiparasitism in invasion, on host species and plant communities and whether hemiparasitism facilitates the establishment of additional exotic species.

    Research will be conducted in Manitoba and England, allowing us to compare populations of OV from introduced and native ranges. Ecological data will arise from mapping, and sampling vegetation and seedbanks whereas social data will arise from interviews and surveys with producers and managers. This proposal represents one of the first multi-scale studies on invasives that compares natural and introduced populations, and is the first study on invasives that incorporates both biological and social data. This approach will help us better understand the threats associated with invasives, and will resonate with all concerned stakeholders.

"This research aims to design and evaluate a new model and methodology that enables practitioners to more fully analyze the functional gaps in their implemented supply chain management information systems (SCM IS). The primary contribution to knowledge is in understanding the theoretical principles governing the effective design and evaluation of enterprise information systems. A prescriptive model is proposed to assist with determining optimal SCM IS capabilities. A measurement model is also proposed for analyzing gaps between desired and realized capabilities of an implemented SCM IS. Both models incorporate fuzzy logic to model uncertainty and are grounded in prior studies of fit between supply chain configurations and information systems capabilities. The first objective is to design and evaluate a prescriptive model of optimal SCM IS capabilities by: (a) identifying design principles and fuzzy rules for analyzing supply chains and recommending optimal SCM IS capabilities; (b) creating a computer simulation for predicting the performance of different combinations of supply chain and SCM IS configurations; and (c) analyzing the simulation results to validate the fuzzy model. The second objective is to design and evaluate a gap analysis measurement model by: (a) designing a web-based decision support system (DSS) for analyzing SCM IS configurations, determining where functional gaps exist, and explaining how to optimize the configuration; and (b) evaluating the DSS using field studies and experiments to iteratively evaluate and improve the design of the gap analysis decision tools. Contributions to the literature are expected in: (1) new design and evaluation methods for requirements engineering incorporating fuzzy set theory and configurational theory; (2) new fuzzy logic models for analyzing supply chain configurations and emergent information systems capabilities; and (3) new simulation and decision support tools for evaluating the impact of different combinations of supply chain configurations and information systems capabilities. Furthermore, the research program will provide decision-makers with practical guidance on the design, evaluation, and optimization of SCM IS, with an aim to improve their utility.

"As humans, we recognize that we have personalities that differ from one another, even though our behaviour is variable.  These personality differences predict our health, job performance, susceptibility to personal problems such as drug addiction, and capacity to maintain romantic relationships.

     Behavioural, ecological, and evolutionary scientists are now recognizing that individual wild animals from the same population can also differ in personality traits, including general activity, boldness, and willingness to take risks in new situations.  Such findings present us with similar questions about how these personality differences arise in animals and what they mean for an individual's day-to-day prospects of surviving and reproducing in the wild.  

     My research on young brook charr (also called brook trout) is examining how personality differences influence the tendency for populations of animals to diverge into subgroups differing in where and what they eat, and their body shape.  This process of subdivision, called resource polymorphism, is common in animals, especially fishes living in our northern streams and lakes.  Resource polymorphisms represent a unique and important form of biodiversity that may lead to the evolution of new species. My investigations seek to (i) validate whether personality affects the habitat where an individual brook charr lives and the kinds of food it eats, (ii) characterize the genetic and neuro-endocrine basis for the personality differences among individual charr, and (iii) evaluate whether these personality differences facilitate the specific forms of natural selection needed for the evolution of resource polymorphisms.

     It is too early to say whether personality has the same predictive power for wild animals that it does for humans.  However, if it does, it will require scientists to rethink widely held notions of animals being highly flexible in behaviour, of there being a single best way to behave in a particular environmental circumstance, and of the ways in which behaviour can facilitate or resist evolutionary change in wild animals.

"Nickel is a strategic metal widely used in stainless steel, aerospace materials, catalysts, energy storage devices,

fuel cells, batteries and the nuclear industry. The increase in demand for nickel and nickel-alloys together with

a shortage ofnickel resources constitutes a serious problem for the future of the materials industry. The world

nickel reserves consist of approximately 30% sulphide ores and 70% oxide ores. However, despite the relative

abundance of the oxide ores, 60% of the nickel and nickel alloys produced today are derived from sulphide ore

bodies. Based on these considerations, the production ofnickel and its alloys from low-grade oxide ores is

becoming increasingly important. A major concern however in the production offerronickel from oxide ores is

the high sulphur level in the resultant alloy. For this reason, desulphurization of the ferronickel becomes an

important consideration. Another problem associated with this processing route is the low nickel recovery. In

order to improve the desulphurisation reaction and reduce iron and nickel losses, the following issues will be

addressed during this investigation: (1) The effects of different slag compositions and additives on the

desulphurization of ferronickel; (2) The effects of nickel level and the influence of strong deoxidizers on the

desulphurization process; and (3) The effect of interfacial properties on ferronickel droplet separation from

molten slags. In this way, the research will establish a foundation of fundamental knowledge that will facilitate

the design of environmental-friendly fluxes with optimum composition and high sulphide capacity for

ferronickel refIning. The project will also provide an excellent opportunity for the training of students with

appropriate technical expertise for Canada's minerals industry and at the same time help this industrial sector

pursue economically and environmentally sustainable development in an increasingly competitive world

market.","Primary metal products (ferrous and non-ferrous)","University of Toronto",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","M�tallurgie","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"

"Red mud is an iron-rich residue that is produced during the extraction of alumina from bauxite. About 2-4 tonnes of this red mud material are generated for the production of one tonne of aluminum. Because of the size of this waste stream and its causticity, red mud is a major environmental concern. In most cases, the red mud is stored on location close to aluminum companies, and a considerable amount of land is required for this purpose. Development of potential applications for this waste residue that would eliminate its impact on the environment and help restore contaminated sites, is therefore an important consideration. Within the integrated sector of the steel industry, about 400 kg of slag is produced in making one tonne of liquid steel. The amount o disposed slag from the steelmaking converter can be significantly reduced when charging hot metal with low phosphorus and sulphur contents. The novelty of the present proposal is to use waste materials from alumina production as the basis for environment-friendly refining flux in the steel industry in order to generate hot metal with low residual levels of impurities. This will reduce the impact of Canadian industries on the environment and ensure that caustic compounds do not enter the ecosystem. To achieve this goal, the short-term objectives are: 1) To evaluate the physical, chemical and thermal characteristics of red mud waste products as well as synthetic fluxes generated by additions of basic oxides to the red mud materials, 2) To investigate the fundamental thermodynamics that govern phosphorus distribution between red mud based slags and hot metal using an iso-activity method, 3) To measure phosphate and sulphide capacities of red mud based slags using slag-metal equilibration, 4) To evaluate the effect of red mud based slags on the behaviour of refractory lining materials, and 5) To develop a model for the custom design of metallurgical slags derived from red mud and other materials for hot metal pretreatment and steel refining. A longer-term objective is to provide highly qualified personnel with in-depth knowledge in mineral processing, materials production, waste management and environmental control for Canadian industries.","Manufacturing processes and products","University of Toronto",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Transformation des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"

"Despite the fact that one in seven women is affected by stress urinary incontinence, the underlying cause of of this condition is poorly understood. Until recently it was thought that weakness of or damage to the pelvic floor muscles was a major factor in the development of stress urinary incontinence.  Recent studies have suggested that damage to the connective tissues and to the muscles embedded in the urethral wall (the urethral sphincters) may be more important than damage to the pelvic floor muscles when evaluating the presence or severity of incontinence.  Measuring the structural integrity of the pelvic flloor muscles, connective tissues and urethral sphincter muscles, until recently, has not been possible without invasive techniques such as surgery, or expensive techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Because of advances in the technology of ultrasound imaging systems, these measures can now be accomplished inexpensively and non-invasively.  We propose to use ultrasound imaging to investigate the pelvic floor muscles, the integrity of the pelvic connective tissues and the volume of the urethral sphincters and to then use dynamic ultrasound imaging to study the impact of defects in these structures on the function of the extrinsic continence system. This research will help us to understand how and why the continence system fails and consequently to determine what interventions may be most effective to treat stress urinary incontinence in the presence of different deficits.  The applicant has all of the necessary operating funds to pursue this research program, but is in need of equipment funding to purchase an ultrasound system that can be used to make the necessary measurements.  Acquiring this system would benefit the applicant's current trainees immensely, since their thesis work requires ultrasound imaging, and would help the applicant to attract highly qualified trainees and strong international collaborators, since her laboratory would be ideally equipped to peform state of the art studies on the relative importance of different defects on the biomechanics of the continence mechanism.

"Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a multifactorial problem that affects more than one in seven women worldwide, with annual associated costs exceeding one billion dollars, mostly because interventions are largely inadequate. The ultimate goal of the proposed research program is to develop a rapid and inexpensive, reliable and valid assessment tool for the evaluation of the extrinsic continence system in women. Such a tool would enable more informed decision making regarding the therapeutic management of continence dysfunction, which is currently poorly managed likely due to the multiple confounding causes of SUI.  In order to develop such a tool, the completion of basic science experiments to better understand the factors contributing to failure of the extrinsic continence mechanism is essential.   The proposed research projects build on the applicants work to date and are aimed specifically at elucidating the factors that contribute to the failure of the extrinsic continence mechanism - in particular, the pelvic floor muscles (PFMs), the supporting connective tissues, and the external urethral sphincter.

The short term objectives of the proposed research program are:

1.    )	To develop and test a quantification system for the evaluation of PFM defects using 3Dl US imaging

2.    )	To develop and test measures of external urethral sphincter length, thickness and volume determined using 3D US imaging

3.    )	To determine whether delays in the transmission of force from PFM activation to the vagina are associated with the presence and severity of PFM or fascial defects seen on 3D  US imaging

4.    )	To determine whether urethral acceleration and trajectory seen on US images during coughing are associated with the extent of PFM or fascial defects seen on 3D US imaging

5.    )	To determine what measures of the extrinsic continence system most strongly predict the presence and severity of SUI in women.

The proposed projects will serve to provide valuable training experience to 6 highly qualified personnel over a 5 year period.

"Chemical engineers use mathematical models for a variety of needs -  to summarize understanding about how chemical processes work, for predicting how they will behave if changes are made, for learning how to improve the design of products or manufacturing processes, for designing controllers to ensure safe, reliable and profitable operation, and to monitor the operation of the processes to watch for deteriorating equipment and failures. When building models engineers have to decide what type of mathematical equations to use,  and how much physical detail to model. The goal is to balance the need for complicated models against the benefits from using them. Mathematical models also contain constants which have to be estimated by running experiments and collecting experimental information from operating plants. These constants are estimated using statistical techniques.



The challenge is to decide how much detail to include and which constants to estimate. This research project is developing mathematical and statistical tools to help make these decisions. The research is focusing on two types of problems: model-building for optimizing plant operation (real-time optimization), and estimating models when we are trying to predict profiles (curves), instead of single numbers. An example of a profile is the temperature profile in a steel ingot that is being reheated. A relatively new statistical technique called Functional Data Analysis is being used for this problem. We can also use this approach to estimate models that describe how chemical processes change with time. Functional data analysis provides a special way of estimating the models that should make it easier to build useful models.  The last part of the research project is going to develop a new approach for making valuable molecules, using cells and a special way of providing substrate (food) to the cells, and removing the products that the cells make. In this way, we can avoid situations where the cell productivity is poor because there is too much substrate, or too much product.

"The main theme of my research is the study of differential equations arising in mathematical physics by the methods of differential geometry and Lie group theory.  The work is being conducted in three interrelated areas the common threads of which are the geometrical and group invariant methods used.  

The first area is the study of completely integrable Hamiltonian systems.  Such systems include a large number of important physical models described in general by nonlinear systems of differential equations that can be integrated by quadratures.   To solve the problem of integrability for such systems defined on spaces of constant curvature of low dimension the method of moving frames and an analogue of classical invariant theory called the invariant theory of Killing tensors are being used.  

The second area, which is closely related to the first, concerns separability theory for Dirac's equation on pseudo-Riemannian background spaces.  This study is important for the elaboration of particle creation mechanisms in black hole physics.  The goal is the development of a comprehensive theory of separation of variables for Dirac's equation.  

    The third area of study is the problem of the validity of Huygens' principle in the strict sense for second order linear partial differential equations of normal hyperbolic type.   The physical significance of the Huygens' property is that the wave phenomena governed by the equation propagate sharply without the presence of a tail.  Work is being undertaken on a proof of a generalized Hadamard conjecture which states, in the physically interesting case of four dimensions, that a Huygens' equation is equivalent to the pure wave equation on an exact plane wave background space-time.

"This proposal is for the modeling and simulation of real time location systems (RTLS) using radio frequency

identification (RFID) technology, applied to tracking resources, healthcare workers, and/or patients within a

healthcare facility. Specifically, a simulation model will be developed that will serve as a planning tool for the

provisioning of RTLS RFID based systems. Currently there is a need for a RTLS planning and provisioning

system as an increasing number of hospitals and personal care homes contemplate investments in various

tracking technologies. The most overlooked aspect in current RTLS deployment is a lack of understanding of

systemic uncertainty, where the error is due to the emerging RFID technologies as well as the processing of

noisy and unreliable data in a non stationary environment. In order to address these challenges, RFID tags and

readers will be characterized in an anechoic chamber, augmenting the RF characteristics provided by the

manufacturer. These will be integrated into an agent based simulator developed at the University of Manitoba,

in order to determine the errors associated with the tracking of patient movements within a facility. A tertiary

benefit of the simulator would also be contact graph estimates, useful as inputs to nosocomial control programs

within a healthcare facility. Contact graphs are visual representations of people's connections to other people

(to whom, and for how long). The corresponding RTLS system derived through modeling would be developed

by the industry partner, within a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) framework leveraging the

"This research is concerned with obtaining optimal designs for use in industrial and computer experimentation. Industrial screening experiments are frequently used to ascertain which factors play a statistically significant role in the quality of a product or process under study. It is often the case that the levels of some of the experimental factors are more difficult, or expensive, to vary than the rest. In such settings ""split-plot designs"" often arise. This research considers the optimal choice of split-plot designs consisting of only a few runs (for example, 12, 16, 20, 24, etc). Such designs offer practitioners more flexible run sizes than most split-plot designs presently cataloged in the literature and as such should result in cost-savings for industrial experimenters.



In recent years, the search for optimal designs for use in industrial experimentation has expanded to the development of optimal designs for use in ""computer experiments"". Computer experiments are useful in situations where experimentation is physically impossible (or prohibitively expensive or time-consuming). In such settings complex mathematical models, implemented via computer code, may be developed to mimic the physical process under study for a fraction of the cost. Such models may consist of dozens of parameters, and the output from the computer experiment may consist of thousands of observations. This research considers the design of computer experiments in the setting where functional output occurs. Furthermore, in this context, the effect of ""noise"", or uncontrollable factors, is also considered in the choice of optimal factor level settings for computer experiments.

"My research focuses on the individual-based study of animal populations. I am particularly interested in explaining variation in single-generational proxies of fitness (e.g., lifetime reproductive success) from additive and interactive effects of behaviour, morphology, and an animal's unique experience of the biotic and abiotic environment. By considering the underlying basis of individual contributions to population growth, I hope to bridge ecological and evolutionary dynamics. My work is primarily based on the long-term study of ungulate populations (e.g., red deer, roe deer, caribou, feral horses) using ecology and genetics to answer questions. Recent empirical analyses ask how an animal's fitness might be affected by its use of available resources while taking into consideration unique experiences of important processes such as competition, predation, ecological succession, and cross-generational effects. A key component of this proposal is my plan to establish a long-term (30+ yrs), individual-based study of the population of feral horses on Sable Island, Nova Scotia. Short-term goals providing a foundation for future research are directed at developing a better understanding of: (1) dynamics of the horse population; (2) phenotypic and environmental factors affecting life history;         (3) density-dependent resource selection and links with fitness; (4) band dynamics and sociobiology; and (5) population genetics and micro-evolution. In addition to pursuing my goal of linking ecological and evolution- ary dynamics, I am motivated by the many opportunities that detailed population studies (like that on Sable) allow us to ask of fundamental ecology and evolution. For example, using this system I will also study (6) the potential for the irrupting seal population (which pups on Sable) to transfer from the ocean onto land substant- ial amounts of nitrogen and other nutrients, affecting vegetation and thus life histories and dynamics of the horses. The importance of this work is wide ranging, from asking 'blue sky' questions (e.g., why do some line- ages flourish while others decline or go extinct, why might some strategies or traits be selected for at one time but not another) to the applied (e.g., methods to identify critical habitat important for species conservation).

These studies will look at the kinetics of polymerization in relation to the detailed structure of polymers (relative monomer composition and size (molecular weight)). The fundamental aim of the proposed work in scientific terms is to provide a better appreciation of the major controlling factors for polymerizations in aqueous media.  It is proposed to carry out systematic experimental studies with a goal of understanding multi-component systems for producing water-soluble polymers.  The study would provide valuable data that would be used to develop mathematical models for the polymerizations, which could then be used as reliable predictive tools.  This would allow the design of more efficient processes for making polymers with targeted structures.  The information obtained will also allow for a better understanding of processes that have great potential in applications of growing economic and practical interest such as pharmaceutical delivery and functional nanoparticles.  In addition to the scientific data collected the study would also provide excellent training opportunities for HQP in the area of polymer synthesis and characterization.","Polymers, rubber and plastics","University of Waterloo",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Chimie des polym�res","Chimie des polym�res"
"Fast-paced economic and industrial growth in Saskatchewan translate into significantly higher water quality and quantity assessments and treatment to meet demand and maintain environmental integrity. The impacts of climate change, oilfield and mining activities, non-point inputs from agricultural nutrients and chemicals, and winter highway maintenance have significant effects on raw water quality. Since the majority of potable water is not consumed as drinking water there is potential to reclaim stormwater in place of high-cost, treated potable water for new economic growth activities and industries while reducing load on municipal infrastructure. SK surface water presents several unique design and management challenges, particularly since nutrient loading is in the dissolved form. Thus, many existing methods and models for nutrient removal in water treatment do not address this challenge. This project will investigate a variety of options for reclaiming and treating stormwater for reuse in circumstances where large volumes of good quality, subpotable water are required. Research will focus on porous media byproducts from SK industries for removal of eutrophication-causing inorganic phosphorous and nitrogen. The removal of other urban contaminants, such as landscaping pesticides, oils and grease, and microorganisms will be investigated in sub-projects to evaluate overall system design efficacy, limitations, processes, and models for remediation. Mechanistic models will be developed to elucidate fundamental processes by which inorganic nutrients are removed from reclaimed water. Model development and calibration include a variety of environmental and water quality conditions and proposed mechanisms of contaminant removal, including adsorption, absorption, bulk transport, pore transport (both pore and surface diffusion). These mechanisms and processes are investigated for implementation and publication of models and scholarly results of performance monitoring. The potential reclamation and reuse models can be applied where water supplies are sparse, drought-susceptible, over-allocated or disputed for multiple users, or otherwise restricted or compromised.

"Consumer demand for fresh, minimally processed, convenient food products has resulted in a tremendous increase in the availability of refrigerated, ready-to-eat foods. Currently, refrigeration is the only hurdle to the growth of foodborne pathogens that can contaminate these products. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produce antibacterial peptides, known as bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of some pathogenic bacteria. There is need for further development of sensitive analytical techniques for detection of these compounds.  We developed a sensitive method for detection of bacteriocins using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer and this method was used to determine the fate of nisin, a bacteriocin that is approved for use in foods.  However, we have not been able to detect the production of other bacteriocins in foods.  Further research is required to improve the sensitivity and specificity of analytical techniques for detection of bacteriocins produced in foods.  

Recent research has shown that the presence of more than one bacteriocin in a model system can dramatically increase the inhibitory activity against foodborne pathogens.  However, production of multiple bacteriocins in a single organism has not resulted in increased antimicrobial activity. This will have to be overcome if we are to optimize bacteriocin production in LAB. 

The objectives of this research program are to: 1) optimize methods for detection of bacteriocins in foods; and to 2) develop genetic-based strategies to improve production of multiple bacteriocins in LAB.  The successful outcome of this research will provide the food industry with effective biopreservatives for minimally processed meats and will provide assays for detection of bacteriocins in foods. Further understanding of the role of lactic acid bacteria and bacteriocins in microbial ecology will greatly enhance their application as hurdles to enhance the safety of our food supply.

"As humans, we interact with objects in our environment in two ways: by identifying them and by using them. This proposal will study the visual brain mechanisms that underlie these abilities. In particular, comparisons will be made between objects that we can grasp and use like a hammer and those that we cannot like a tree. Is this difference reflected in our learning about and forming memories for objects? Does the ability to grasp and use objects influence our ability to identify them? Does our ability to identify objects influence our ability to use them? Two models of processing object identity and use will be tested. One postulates that we know how to use objects simply based on their visual appearance. Another model postulates that we only know how to use objects after we have identified them. The proposed studies will measure the time and accuracy of our object identification as a function of our ability to use them. Measures of grasping and using objects will also be made. 

These questions relate to the brain with respect to two major pathways that process visual information. One is involved in object identification and another in reaching and grasping for objects. These pathways have been thought to function independently. The studies proposed here will test that assumption and determine when it holds true and when it does not. Most of the proposed studies will involve testing individuals with normal visual brain function. Some studies will test individuals who have lost the ability to name visually presented objects or functionally use objects to see how the loss of one ability affects the intact ability. This research will help us build more comprehensive models of visual object recognition and brain functioning. These models in turn will guide us in developing better rehabilitation programs for individuals who have lost these functions due to brain damage. They will also be of use in building future machines that interface with our visual and action brain systems and perhaps for the design of autonomous remote robotics.

"The Cold Dark Matter model for the formation and evolution of structure in the Universe successfully describes how galaxies and clusters of galaxies are spread throughout the cosmos.  However it fails to describe the basic properties of galaxies themselves.  Astronomers are beginning to realize that this failure is related to a key piece of missing physics: outflows of matter and energy from supermassive black holes in the nuclei of galaxies.  These outflows are difficult to model in part because there are few reliable measurements of the energy they release.  The best measurements have emerged from recent X-ray observations of galaxies and galaxy clusters.



High resolution images taken with NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory have revealed enormous voids in the rarefied atmospheres of hot gas surrounding galaxies and galaxy clusters.  The voids are typically 70,000 light years across, but can be up to 700,000 light years across (seven times the diameter of the Milky Way). They were created by powerful jets of charged particles gyrating along magnetic field lines at  relativistic speeds.  The jets themselves are created by supermassive black holes weighing as much as one billion Suns lurking in the nuclei of galaxies. The energy they release exceeds the power output of the Sun by up to ten trillion times, enough explosive power to drive outflows that displace between one billion and a trillion Suns worth of gas.  These outflows apparently play a fundamental role in the process of galaxy formation by limiting the sizes that galaxies and their attendant supermassive black holes can achieve.  This five year study of galaxies and clusters using a combination of X-ray, visual, ultraviolet, infrared, and radio telescopes will paint a vivid picture of how galaxies and their supermassive black holes form and evolve.  It will also delve deeply into the nature of the powerful and enigmatic radio jets emerging from the environs of supermassive black holes.

"The seasonal migration of the monarch butterfly has been well documented yet we still do not understand how the monarchs, born in North America, locate the specific overwintering sites, used year after year in Mexico.  We will carry out experiments to test the hypothesis that compounds left by previous generations of butterflies accumulate in the waxes of host trees serve as cues for immigrants, and that these are based on compounds acquired from plants through larval and adult feeding. If true, this will not only answer one of important unanswered questions related to this amazing natural phenomenon, but also provide a potential tool for the conservation of the species. The armyworm is a seasonal migrant cereal pest and we have been using this species as a model system to study moth migration. We are extending our studies of the physiology under lying migratory behavior in the laboratory into the field. The propsed research will contribute to our understanding of eco-physiology in migrant moths, including tradeoffs between migratory flight and future reproduction, and determine if a foraging gene plays a role in migration. It has been well documented that plants emit volatiles following attack by a herbivore and that these are involved in the up-regulation of defenses. Furthermore, natural enemies of herbivores use these volatiles as foraging cues. However, most of the work has been carried out under a limited range of ecological conditions and we have no real understanding of the how important these cues are under variable ecological conditions. Using the unique facilities in the Biotron Climate Change Research Center at UWO we will examine how an array of different climatic conditions affect the up-regulation of plant defenses as the responses of parasitoids to the resulting volatiles. The results obtained will help understand how climate change will affect the induction of plant defenses, help determine to what extent volatiles from defoliated plants serve as foraging cues for beneficial insects and clarify whether there really is any potential for these compounds in integrated pest management programs.

"I propose an integrated synthetic, mechanistic, and computational study to probe selectively the effects of electronic configuration and spin state on the stoichiometric reactions fundamental to organometallic catalysis.  Careful interplay of metal properties and ligand design will allow for the synthesis of compounds wherein steric and/or electronic modification to the periphery of the ligand sphere will adjust the orbital splitting and pairing energies at the metal centre, either inductively or by adjusting the coordination geometry, thereby selectively tuning the spin state energies of the compound.  This will allow for the synthesis of pairs or series of compounds with identical metals and oxidation states in similar coordination environments, but differing ground state spin, permitting a systematic mechanistic study of how the spin state of a complex alone affects the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reactions that make up organometallic catalytic cycles.

 

The rational design of catalysts for synthetic organic and industrial applications continues to be a principal focus of organometallic chemistry.  The spin state of the catalyst has the potential to play a critical role, in that the presence of unpaired electrons or the need to cross over between surfaces of different spin can have a profound and often unexpected effect on the energies, mechanisms, and rates of reactions.  An increasing number of recently developed catalytic systems, particularly those in the area of alkene polymerization, employ mid-valent compounds of first-row metals such as Cr, Fe, and Co, yielding catalysts or catalyst precursors that not only have paramagnetic ground states, but also may cross between different spin surfaces during the catalytic cycle.  An increasing body of work suggests that spin crossover phenomena will prove to play an enormous role in organometallic catalysis.  The principal goal of this research is therefore the first systematic study to isolate and investigate the means by which spin state alone can affect and control organometallic reactivity generally, and to demonstrate specific instances in which this control might be exploited.



Two well-defined systems of relevance to alkene polymerization chemistry are currently under investigation.  These are bis(oxazolinyl)pyridine dialkyl iron(II) (traditional Ziegler-Natta polymerization), and bis(amidinate) and bis(beta-ketoamine) monoalkyl cobalt(III) complexes (atom transfer and organometallic radical polymerization).  Both are five-coordinate, 16 valence electron systems with six d-shell electrons, but in each case there are multiple possible ground state spins, with the most likely configurations being the open-shell quintet and closed-shell singlet.  In each case, the ligands are easily modified to bear a variety of electron donating/withdrawing groups of varying steric profile, which affords control of the exhibited spin properties.  This will permit a side-by-side comparison of fundamental organometallic reactions, whereby one reaction takes place on a single diamagnetic spin surface, while the other takes place on either a wholly paramagnetic surface or requires a crossover from one spin state to another.  Reactions such as coordination, insertion, and beta-elimination are of relevance to Z-N polymerization mechanisms, while single-electron and atom transfer reactions are important in ATRP and OMRP.  Computational studies employing DFT will both guide the choice of systems for experimental investigation, and serve to interpret and support the mechanistic results.



This approach of investigation is well suited to the resources associated with current undergraduate research at UBC Okanagan, but will easily be applied to longer-term studies as our graduate programme develops.  The proposed target compounds are a few simple synthetic steps from commercially available and inexpensive materials.  The ligand systems are easily modified, allowing a wide range of compounds to be developed quickly.  The integrated nature of the study will give students experience with organic and organometallic synthesis and characterization, mechanistic studies using UV-visible and NMR spectroscopic techniques, and computational methods.  Despite their relatively simple basis, I believe these studies have dramatic implications, and will yield results that will greatly enhance the rational design of open-shell paramagnetic transition-metal catalysts.","Advancement of knowledge","University of British Columbia",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Chimie inorganique","Chimie inorganique"

"Digital computing systems have become a key component in the design of a vast range of consumer products from cellular telephones to washing machines, from portable music players to anti-lock breaking systems in our cars. These systems all rely on sensors of various types to gather information from the environment and from the users of these devices. They then use microprocessors, embedded within the devices, to process the sensed information and to convert it into a new and more meaningful form.

In some cases this processing is straightforward, such as the decoding of pre-recorded music into sound that we can hear. In other applications, the precise processing method needed to extract meaning from the sensed information may not be well understood, or there may be no existing step-by-step (deterministic) procedure one can identify in advance that is able to process the available information correctly in all cases. Nonetheless, by examining the information it may be possible to extract some meaning from underlying regularities within the collected data.

This proposal is intended to explore methods of dealing with these difficult signal processing tasks in an efficient and cost-effective manner that is suitable for use in embedded computing applications. In achieving this, various methods will be explored which fall into a class of information processing algorithms known collectively as neural computing. However, unlike the majority of previous investigations into the use of these techniques, the additional constraint of operating in an embedded environment will be considered. In addition, the proposed investigations will explore unique methods of encoding the information being processed in these systems, in order to permit the use of novel computing approaches which may be well suited to specialized embedded signal processing applications.","Information systems and technology","University of Manitoba",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Syst�mes d'apprentissage adaptatifs et �volutifs","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"

"Mining and smelting are extremely important to the Canadian economy. Canada exported $48 billion worth of non-fuel minerals and mineral products in 2000 and is the world's largest producer of uranium, the third largest producer of copper, and produces zinc, lead, cadmium, platinum, indium, aluminum, gold... The economic dependence on this industry means that there are large numbers of Canadian workers exposed to potentially toxic elements and many Canadians exposed environmentally at lower levels.  Workers who are known to be exposed are generally monitored by their employer via blood and urine measurements. Workers whose levels increase above certain pre-set limits will be removed from potentially high exposure situations until their levels fall. However, measurement of blood or urine alone does not allow exogenous and endogenous exposures to be separately accounted for, and this can make the interpretation of risk complicated. It also makes the management of workers with extensive employment histories difficult, as they often have body stores of the element which can keep blood and urines elevated even in the absence of external exposure.  

In addition, members of the public are not routinely monitored for their exposure. If exposure to a toxic element is suspected, blood and urine measurements can be performed. However, these usually only indicate recent exposure whereas the exposure may have taken place months or years prior  to the health consequence, and many health effects are a result of chronic or cumulative exposure. Biopsies can be taken to add further information, but these are uncomfortable at best, and may not be representative of the level within a whole organ. There is therefore a role in health management for techniques which can non-invasively measure in vivo the level of a toxic element either in organs at risk or in organs where the element is stored.

The aim of this proposal is to develop physics techniques for the non-invasive in vivo measurement of four elements; arsenic, indium, aluminum and fluorine. Three techniques will be employed; x-ray fluorescence (XRF), neutron activation analysis (NAA) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).

"AQL Management Consulting Inc. (the industry partner), is a sub-contractor for the the Food Safety and

Animal Health Division (FSD) of Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development (AARD, a government

department), who presented the partner with a difficult problem concerning the early detection of important

animal health events. The purpose of the proposed research is to develop novel statistical methodology to help

the industry partner to solve this most interesting problem. This solution will be of obvious benefit to the

industry partner, to AARD and, in a more broad sense, to Canada. During the Canadian BSE crisis of 2003, the

beef industry estimated losses at close to $11 million a day in exports once the border closed, and around $7

million a day due to the drop in beef prices (source: www2.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications).

Although the proposed methodology with be applicable to a myriad of diseases, the benefit to the Canadian

economy of methods that will help to prevent a future such BSE crisis alone are tremendous. Furthermore, the

competitive advantage to the industry partner once the methodology is proven will be significant.

The Alberta Veterinary Surveillance Network (AVSN) is run by a team at the FSD. The AVSN team

manages an online tool used by veterinarians in the field to provide data that are used to systematically and

constantly observe livestock and poultry in Alberta. Such surveillance systems will not detect important health

events that would not otherwise be detected. That is, important health events will always make themselves

known sooner or later. The goal in veterinary surveillance is therefore to detect important events as early as

possible and, if possible, before they would otherwise have become known. An effective early detection system

can greatly reduce potential losses that may arise from an important event. Broadly, these events can be

livestock events, poultry events, events of concern regarding food safety, and/or public health events. The

objective of the research that will be carried out under this proposal is to develop novel and effective statistical

approaches that will facilitate better early detection.","Animal management (animal diseases, breeding)","University of Guelph",1,"EGP   ","Engage Grants Program                                                                               ","Statistique et probabilit�","Statistique et probabilit�"
"The design of new products for consumer markets has undergone a major transformation over the last 50 years. Traditionally, inventors would create a new product that they thought might address a perceived need or want of consumers. The products tended to be developed to meet the inventors' own perception and not necessarily that of consumers. The social consequence of a top-down approach to product development has been a large failure rate in new product introduction. By surveying potential customers a refined target is created that guides developers and reduces the failure rate. Today, however, the proliferation of products and the emergence of consumer choice has resulted in the identification of segments within the market. Consumers were originally segmented on demographics but the proportion of disposable income has increased so much for people in the developed world that choice is now based upon liking rather than having the financial means. Therefore, to build successful products it is essential to understand your target market. Typically a product category assessment is performed, where 12 to 30 commercial products are tested with consumers to create a preference map. Every consumer gets to test every product in a complete block design. Products that have been designed for a theoretical average consumer are usually positioned in the middle of the road and do not attract strong consumer liking. The application of cluster analysis to these large consumer studies of category liking is now well established and it is know that there are several classes of products that do not lend themselves to existing approaches. These tend to be 'high-fatigue' products. These include beverage alcohol products; intensely flavored products, like coffee or chocolate; and highly seasoned products, like salsa or curry. This project will see the development of methodologies that will permit the application of clustering to a wide range of difficult consumer products, including high-fatigue products. The resulting methodologies will be of significant benefit to the industrial partner and their clients. and, more generally, to the Canadian economy.

"Clustering means to group, to gather together or to classify. Clustering techniques are used across a wide range of scientific and social disciplines, such as food science, evolution, disease diagnosis and prevention, and in the analysis of bioinformatics data. For example, chemical data can be used to classify a certain food as authentic or not. In recent years, a particular type of clustering; model-based clustering, has become increasingly popular. The work that will be carried out under this proposal is at the cutting-edge of model-based clustering. Existing methods of analyzing data like the food authenticity example given above will be greatly expanded and techniques for the clustering of data that depend on time will be developed. Data that depend on time also arise in a variety of areas. For example, such data could arise from drug trials, where effects are monitored over a period of time. 



Work already completed on the construction of a twelve-member family of Gaussian mixture models, with parsimonious factor analysis-like covariance structure, will be replicated for mixtures of t-distributions. This will lead to new family of model-based clustering techniques that will offer the analyst greater modeling diversity. Other work has been carried out using Gaussian mixture models to model longitudinal data will be developed from the existing four models to a larger family of mixture models. This family of models uses a modified Cholesky-decomposed covariance structure and also has the potential for extension to mixtures of t-distributions. 



Software will be implemented for each technique so that when this work is complete, a suite of effective and efficient model-based clustering techniques will be available to the analyst. Therefore, these techniques will be accessible to researchers from a broad range of disciplines both here in Canada and abroad.

"Falls account for 30% of all hospital admissions in Canada, and are the second leading cause of injury after motor vehicle collisions.  Work-related back injuries are responsible for 44% of all injuries that require time away from work.  Medical remedies include physical training, assistive devices, and even surgery.  But how does one test out a potential remedy before using it on a patient?  The safety implications are profound.  Computer models and simulations can help, but only if the simulations give accurate results.  Unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms that cause a loss of balance or a back injury are poorly understood. 

Profs. McPhee, McGill, and Kofman have been developing fundamental theories and models to predict how humans balance and the loads that are developed in the lower back and other joints. These predictive tools can be used to diagnose and treat balance and back problems more effectively, and to design biomechatronic assistive devices, thereby reducing the occurrence and severity of preventable injuries.

Before these theoretical models can be used in medical applications, they must be validated under a variety of situations, many of which cannot be handled by conventional non-portable motion capture systems. The requested motion capture suit would allow us to analyze everyday activities such as ascending and descending stairs, driving a car, running, jumping, and other sporting activities that are typically ignored due to lab constraints. The suit provides reliable measurements of human motions that we will use to validate and refine our models.  The motion capture suit will be used in tandem with our portable force plates and pressure pads to function as a traveling research clinic.

Despite over a century of effort, the underlying strategies that humans use to balance and control their muscles is poorly understood.  The requested equipment will help us advance our knowledge of these phenomena to reduce the frequency and severity of preventable injuries to Canadians, by yielding better diagnostic and rehabilitation methods for clinicians.","Biomedical engineering","University of Waterloo",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)",Dynamique,"G�nie m�canique"

"Introduction

Rhomboids are considered to be the most highly conserved membrane protein family.  Indeed, Rhomboid proteins are present in all domains of life, yet very little is known about their biological function throughout evolution.   Rhomboids can be categorized into three broad categories, based on sequence characteristics: 1; active intra-membrane serine proteases localized throughout the secretory pathway, 2; catalytically inactive, presumably dominant negative proteins regulating the active rhomboids, and 3; mitochondrial inner-membrane-localized proteases that regulate membrane dynamics.  I have previously shown in both yeast and flies that the conserved mitochondria-localized class of rhomboids regulates mitochondrial function by controlling membrane dynamics, specifically the fusion of the mitochondrial double membrane.  I have preliminary data that suggests the function of the secretory pathway localized yeast rhomboid protease is to regulate protein trafficking by controlling vesicular transport.  Intracellular transport can be considered another kind of membrane dynamic, suggesting a general conservation of rhomboid function within yeast.

Hypothesis: Yeast Rbd2 is an intra-membrane protease of the secretory system that is regulated by proline isomerization, and regulates membrane trafficking and protein targeting by interacting with and cleaving a number of physiologically important membrane-bound substrates. We propose to test these possibilities by answering the following questions/aims;

1) Yeast Rhomboid-2 is localized to the golgi-apparatus of the secretory system.

2) Ablation of Rhomboid-2 results in disruption of protein sorting within the intracellular transport pathway.

3) Yeast Rhomboid-2 functions as an active protease, and regulates membrane trafficking by processing trans-membrane domain containing proteins required for protein sorting and/or vesicle targeting.

4) Yeast Rhomboid-2 is regulated by isomerization of a conserved proline bond.

"The goals of this proposal are to get a better grasp on how people understand language, and how they are able to acquire the concepts and categories that enable them to function in today's world. Focusing first on language, developing clear ideas or theories regarding how people understand the language that they read or hear is an important part of discovering how the mind and brain work. To understand how people process language requires getting a firm handle on what they are doing moment-to-moment. One of the best ways to do so is to track precisely where people's eyes are fixating as they read (that is, what words or letters they are looking at, and how long they look at them). Another way is to present objects or scenes that are relevant to the language that people are hearing, and then to monitor precisely what people are looking at as they listen to speech. Clever manipulations of scenes and language can uncover the degree to which people's understanding of speech lags behind the speech, or actually anticipates what might be spoken next. Furthermore, errors that people make, for example, looking at an object that is irrelevant to the spoken message, can reveal sources of language problems. Therefore, one goal of this NSERC equipment grant is to purchase an eyetracker that will allow us to monitor the fixations of normal children, adults, and children with dyslexia as they process language. The results of the experiments using this eyetracker will help in developing theories of language processing, as well as developing better therapies for those with language difficulties. In terms of concepts and categories, both vision and language are important aspects of people's ability to form categories such as ""dogs"" or ""vehicles"". Categories allow us to recognize things in our world, and to respond to them appropriately. Eyetracking can reveal moment-to-moment aspects of precisely what children and adults are doing when they are acquiring the knowledge necessary for categorization. Therefore, the second goal of this proposal grant is to use the eyetracker to obtain a more precise characterization of how people use both verbal and visual information while they acquire and use categories.

"Language is a major part of what makes us human. The broad objective of my research is to understand how people interpret what they hear and read, how this knowledge develops in children, and how it becomes degraded due to brain impairments. My research is roughly divided into two parts. In one part, I and my collaborators study people's memory for the meaning of words that refer to living things such as dog, and nonliving things such as toaster. To do this, we use ""neural networks"", which are models of mental processing that are written as computer programs. We have built a series of neural networks that produce the meaning of words like toaster given how the word is spelled or pronounced. We study how our models work and then use that knowledge to come up with predictions that we test on human participants. This testing typically involves looking at the time it takes for people to answer questions like, ""Does a shirt have a pocket?"" or ""Does the word dog refer to something you can touch?"" We also damage our models by altering the program so that part of the simulated mind no longer works correctly. We then test whether the damaged model mimics the performance of people who have suffered brain damage.

People's knowledge of the meaning of verbs like arresting and adopting is an important part of their ability to understand language. We study how verbs and nouns are linked to knowledge of events in memory, and how that knowledge is organized in our mind. We use both computer simulations and reading and listening experiments to gain insight into these processes.

Although our work is primarily theoretical in nature, it has practical implications. Detailed theories of language comprehension help in developing better methods of teaching children how to listen, speak, read, and write. In addition, studying patients' performance and damaged models can provide important insights into these conditions. For example, it is possible to test different ways of retraining the models after they are damaged. These studies can then be used as a guide for developing rehabilitation programs after damage has occurred.","Advancement of knowledge","University of Western Ontario",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Science cognitive -- langage",Psychologie

"The energy budget of the Earth's space environment is largely controlled by the energy transfer between the solar wind (a gas of charged particles expelled from the Sun) and the Earth's magnetic field - the ""magnetosphere.""  Just as the light and heat radiation from the Sun cause the weather patterns that we experience on the ground, the solar wind causes ""space weather"" that affects the Earth's space environment.  The solar wind is the cause of the spectacular northern lights that we enjoy, but it can also damage satellite electronics and power transmission lines on the ground.  The aim of this study is to investigate the ways in which the solar wind affects the Earth's magnetosphere.  The ionosphere, which is the boundary layer between the top of the atmosphere and the bottom of the magnetosphere, is special because it is the region of the Earth's atmosphere where large horizontal electric currents can flow. The magnetic field lines of the Earth connect all points in the magnetosphere to the ionosphere; so the dynamics of the magnetosphere are projected down on the ionosphere, which acts like a vast television screen. Radars like SuperDARN - one of which is located just outside of Saskatoon - measure the motion of the charged particles in the ionosphere, and thereby reveal the larger-scale motions in the magnetosphere. Cameras that photograph the aurora tell us about the energy of the particles as they hit the ionosphere, producing light, including the aurora that we can see.  Canada has a long and successful history of ground-based space science, as well as expertise in auroral imaging from space. Canadians are drawn to space science because the majority of the energy input from the solar wind to the Earth's magnetosphere occurs in regions where one can see the aurora, and Canada has the largest landmass underneath these auroral regions. Our proposal is to use ground-based instruments in Canada, along with satellite instruments, to achieve a greater understanding of the influence of solar activity on the Earth's environment, both in geospace, the region of primary space exploration, and in the atmosphere.","Space and astronomy","University of Saskatchewan",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Recherche spatiale","Recherche spatiale"

"Thorough testing of circuits, software and networks is critical but it is often neglected since it can be complicated and time consuming.  Researchers have tried to find testing schemes that would reduce the amount of work required to test a system, while still having a rigorous set of tests. One such scheme is determined by a design called a covering array. A covering array describes a scheme that completely tests every pair of parameters in the system, rather than completely testing all possible sets of parameters in a system. This leads to testing that is both effective and efficient. A further improvement on such a testing scheme is to only test pairs of parameters that are known to interact. Since the set of pairs which interact can be recorded in a graph structure, this leads to a refinement, called a covering array on a graph.



This research program includes finding constructions for covering arrays, determining bounds on the size of a covering array, and deciding if a covering array on a given graph exists. A novel approach in my research is that I have defined a family of graphs which have the property that a covering array on a given graph exists if and only if there is a graph homomorphism of the given graph to a graph in the family. This family of graphs has special properties that make it particularly well-suited to methods from algebraic graph theory. This new approach allows for the application of results from graph theory and the use of algebraic methods to study covering arrays. 



This research program draws on theory in a number of disparate fields in pure mathematics. For example, key results for a sub-family of covering arrays are a direct consequence of well-known theorems in extremal finite set theory. This research program includes developing the natural extension of these results to general covering arrays.","Mathematical sciences","University of Regina",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Combinatoire,"Math�matiques pures"

"Intercellular communication between nerve cells in the brain involves highly specialized regions of contact,termed synapses, between pre and post-synaptic neurons. It is here that there is an enrichment of receptors and signaling molecules that respond to neurotransmitters and growth factors that, in turn, can strengthen and/or weaken a particular synapse. The increase and/or loss of particular synapses underlies a process termed neuronal plasticity and it is this process that modulates neuronal activity and the process of learning and memory. Two different classes of cell surface receptors have been shown to serve important roles in learning and memory. First, the NMDA receptors which are activated by excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain (eg. glutamate) and, second, a receptor termed TrkB which responds to a growth factor termed brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Since these are 2 very different types of receptors, it is not well understood how they co-regulate this process.

     My lab has identified 2 intracellular signaling molecules that regulate the activity of both receptors, namely, the adapter protein ShcC and the nucleotide exchange factor, RasGrf1. ShcC-/- mice are smarter, learn faster and have increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. This uncouples the receptor from clathrin-mediated turnover and increases its cell surface expression and potential for activation. We have found that ShcC can interact with a tyrosine phosphatase, possibly STEP, and potentially regulate its localization to the post synaptic membrane to de-phosphorylate NR2B. RasGrf1, on the other hand, binds to the NMDA receptor and decreases NMDA signaling and synaptic activity.  We have found when TrkB is activated, RasGrf1 is uncoupled from the NMDA receptor. This increases NMDA signaling and the activation of Erk which positively correlates learning and memory.  

     We will continue to use molecular approaches to characterize these interactions and their effect(s) on synaptic growth and NMDA receptor signaling in wild type, ShcC-/- and RasGrf1-/- mice.

"Parental care alters cognitive development in children.  However, cognition is often evaluated in terms of episodic learning and memory (memory for facts, temporal and spatial relations, etc.), which assess skills essential for performance in school and the workplace.  Such tests reveal enhanced performance as a function of increased parental nurturance.  While children from more stressful families are often disadvantage on such tests, there may be forms of learning that are enhanced by such circumstances.  Our studies directly address this issue in the rat, a highly social species that reveals considerable evidence for the effects of maternal care in early life.  Synaptic plasticity is associated with the acquisition of information.  Maternal care (pup licking by the mother) in the rat increases the capacity for episodic learning. We used an in vitro model of long-term potentiation to examine hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Maternal care enhanced synaptic plasticity in adult offspring under normal conditions.  However, synaptic plasticity under conditions of elevated corticosterone, a stress hormone, was enhanced in animals from low licking mothers. Moreover, while impaired on measures of episodic learning, these animals show an increased ability to associate a context with a painful event (stress).  Stressful environments alter maternal care (decrease pup licking) and the resulting modification in maternal care may ""prepare"" neuronal systems for life under stressful circumstances. Our studies will examine 1) the capacity for synaptic plasticity under varying conditions as a function of maternal care in early life and 2) the biological basis for the effects of maternal care as well as later environmental enrichment on hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and 3) the relevance of such effects for behaviour.",Psychology,"McGill University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Neurologie du comportement",Psychologie
"Heat shock proteins are a class of proteins whose cellular expression can be increased by exposure of the cells to a potentially lethal stress, such as heat shock.  One of these proteins is the small heat shock protein called Hsp27.  This protein is expressed in a variety of cell types, but my interest is in its role in cells of the nervous system.  Our research has shown that this protein can protect neurons from damage from various stressors.  However, this protein is also found normal sensory neurons and we do not fully understand its role in the normal cells.  It appears to play a role in the ability of these sensory neurons to regenerate after nerve injury.  The research we describe in this project is designed to help us understand how Hsp27 can interact with the neuronal cytoskeleton (that is required for regeneration) and how it may contribute to promoting regeneration after damage.  Understanding how proteins such as the sHsps function in the normal nervous system, particularly in neurons whose regenerative potential is quite good, will provide basic information on ways in which neuronal growth can be regulated. The normal role of Hsp27 in neurons, particularly those in which it is constitutively expressed, is not fully known; not all neurons express Hsp27 nor can it be induced in all neurons.  This suggests that there is something special about its presence in sensory neurons which could be related to the generally very high regenerative potential of peripheral nerve axons, in contrast to that of CNS axons.

"Vitamins and phytochemicals are important constituents of the foods we eat and the environment in which humans find themselves in daily contact.  Some vitamins behave in a similar fashion to classical steroid hormones with which we are very familiar, including the reproductive hormones estrogen and testosterone.  While people readily accept that vitamin D is important for normal growth and development of teeth and bones, much less is known about its activity as a hormone in the control of blood and epithelial tissue development.  Furthermore, though the nucleus (the brains of a cell) is frequently assumed to be the target of steroid hormones, we recently determined that much of vitamin D action was mediated by a receptor that resides largely at the surface of responsive cells.  The current research program attempts to characterize the nature of this receptor-hormone complex, the critical participants in its ability to signal changes in cell behaviour, and the potential to regulate this response through changes in cell environment including exposure to omega-3 fatty acids and non-nutritive components of foods, usually described as phytochemicals.  The hope is that this information will give us critical insight into how and why cells make the decisions to divide, die, differentiate or become quiet when challenged with specific molecules in their surroundings.  This could provide the knowledge necessary to conceive of novel functional foods for animal and human consumption along with contributing to to our understanding of how the nutritive and non-nutritive components of foods contribute to normal growth and development and failure in the development of disease.

"Development of a reliable Mg database that contains all the possible alloying elements is the applicant's long term objective. This will be achieved through computational thermodynamics coupled with key experiments using DSC, XRD, SEM/EPMA and diffusion-couples techniques. This proved to reduce the time and effort necessary to establish such a multicomponent database. The current proposal focuses on investigating Mg ternary systems that have strong potential for metallic glass applications. Three of such systems are Mg-Al-Y, Mg-Ni-Y and Mg-Cu-Y. Mg-based glass-forming alloys have attracted special attention due to their low-density, high strength, excellent corrosion resistance, and high toughness. Mg-based metallic glasses exhibit high tensile fracture strength which is more than twice as high as the highest strength of conventional Mg-based crystalline alloys. More importantly, it is mentioned in the literature that Mg-based alloys have the potential to produce the largest bulk metallic glass. So far, the efforts worldwide are focussed on the improvement of the glass-forming ability of Mg-based alloys by additions of different alloying elements. The current proposal aims at contributing to these efforts by providing a self-consistent thermodynamic database that can be used to identify the most promising compositions for Mg-alloys that have the highest glass-forming ability. Unlike the current practice of trial and error method, in the proposed research, the compositions that have the tendency to form bulk metallic glasses will be identified using this database. This can be obtained through identifying the compositions that exhibit low lying liquidus surface. It is worth noting that this strategy will enhance the chance of obtaining the most suitable Mg-based alloys for bulk metallic glass applications instead of the traditional empirical trial and error experimentation. Further, the proposed strategy will enable predicting the composition sensitivity of the glass-forming ability which is not possible by the existing criteria that are based on atomic size distribution. This project will benefit Canadian automobile and aerospace industries and will provide new opportunities to all Mg products producers.","Materials sciences","Concordia University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Science et technologie des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"

"High strength thermoset epoxy resins are extensively used in high performance lightweight composite laminates for aerospace, automotive, marine and electronic packaging applications. However, these epoxies suffer from relatively poor fracture toughness and are intolerant of defects. Whilst limited improvement in toughness can be achieved using certain common additives, these additives also lead to reductions in high temperature mechanical properties. It is therefore the objective of this work to replace these common additives with nanofillers, and to determine the influence of the type, size and amount of these nanofillers on the strength and the interlaminar fracture toughness of the studied composite laminates both numerically and experimentally. Numerically, 3D multiscale model, with modified coarse-grained molecular dynamics that accounts for the interaction between the nanofillers and the molecules of the epoxy resin, will be developed. An effective Hamiltonian with course grained DOF will be used to replace the original Hamiltonian of the system, thus increasing the simulation efficiency without compromising accuracy. Furthermore, a new ""nanoelement"", that couples atomistic/continuum regions, will also be developed to overcome the difficulties encountered when enforcement displacement continuity across these regions using commonly adopted continuum finite elements (FE). The FE will be formulated in terms of nodal position vectors to ensure a unified description of energy in the atomistic/continuum regions. Experimentally, extensive mechanical tests, ultrasound and nanostructure analysis will be conducted to characterise the effective properties of the laminates and the distribution of the nanofillers in the epoxy. Carefully designed tests will be conducted to evaluate the effective bond strength/stiffness, interlaminar fracture toughness and strain energy release rate for varying amounts of nanofillers and different temperatures. This will enable the validation of the model and creation of new high performance composites for possible patent and use in the next generation aircrafts.

"The focus of the proposed research is to develop a framework for simultaneous localization, navigation, and control of a team of wheeled robots by fusing their intero/exteroceptive sensors for a distributed sensing task. The sensing task here, in the most general form, can be categorized as; task/role assignment, cooperative transport (e.g., a team of robots pushing a box), cooperative timing (e.g., robotic interception of moving objects), cooperative searching/exploration etc. 

In this context, while there has been a vast interest in formation control of a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the past decade (i.e., moving mobile agents in a group in platoons and/or certain geometries), it is not the most important/relevant cooperation problem in the realm of wheeled mobile robots. In fact, the ability of wheeled mobile robots to stop at certain time intervals to either localise themselves or to help localise other members of the team using their intero/extroceptive sensors would relax the requirement on strict formation in a distributed sensing task. This brings out the appealing notion of anchored-wander in which case each robot is employed in turn, as a mobile external landmark to localise other robots in the team. This will facilitate unlimited range of precise movements for all individual robots in the team as long as they move collectively (but not necessarily in a formation). However, since robots will be operating in a scan-and-go mode, fusing sensory information will remain vital to the agility and more importantly to the precision of the underlying sequential navigation strategy between consecutive scans. Furthermore, properly locating vanguard points (i.e., a sequence of locations at which a single robot, as a mobile landmark, must be anchored) to optimize a certain task will be a very challenging problem not fully addressed before. Examples of potential application domains are: robotic exploration, search and rescue, and collective surveillance.

"Electrostatic charges are generated during particle handling, transport, and processing due to particle-particle, fluid-particle and particle-wall contacts by frictional charging, tribo-electrification and contact charging. The charge build-up results in particle agglomeration, particle-wall adhesion and generation of high-voltage electrical fields, which can cause explosions and therefore be a major hazard. Gas-solid processes such as gas-solid fluidized bed reactors in polymer industries, fluid catalytic crackers in oil and gas industries and tabletting and encapsulation in pharmaceuticals provide ideal environment for electrostatic phenomenon to occur. This research program will attempt to help to gain a better understanding of electrostatic charge generation in mentioned industries by developing a new measurement technique, studying the dominating charge generation mechanisms and determining charge generation control strategies.

"Since the advent of synthetic polymers, the vast majority of such materials in production have been derived from petroleum products.  Dwindling feedstocks of fossil fuels, as well as the growing problem of waste management, generate a need for recyclable and biodegradable polymers derived from renewable or abundant resources.  These polymers also show great promise in medical applications such as organ augmentation and drug delivery, as well as in agricultural applications.  

   In the past two years, my research program has been successful in developing a highly active catalyst system for the living polymerization of lactide, a bio-derived monomer, to form poly(lactic acid), a biodegradable polymer.  I propose to continue to investigate this system by expanding the reaction to other monomers and different catalysts in order to improve the activity and selectivity.  This research is expected to expand our fundamental understanding of these reactions and increase the potential applications of the resulting materials.  We will also pursue the fundamental chemistry of a new family of complexes with the intent to develop catalysts for the copolymerization of carbon monoxide, a ubiquitous gas, and epoxide, a commodity material, to form biodegradable polymers.  The long-term goals of our research program are to develop catalysts for controlled polymerization reactions resulting in the large scale production biodegradable polymers with desirable properties.

"Upstream Oil and Gas operations, such as drilling of oil and gas wells, well workovers, cleaning and stimulation, petroleum separation and processing, and air injection-based improved oil recovery (IOR), may involve air or an oxygen containing gas in the presence of hydrocarbons.  In such operations, air or oxygen containing gas may be introduced either deliberately (as a part of the process) or undesirably (due to the nature of the operations).  Therefore, when an ignition source is also present, there is a potential for fire and/or explosion hazard.  Over the past several years, there have been a number of serious oilfield fires and explosions that have resulted in worker injuries and fatalities, and significant loss of equipment.  During this period, there has been an increase in the use of air or oxygen containing gas during such operations in Canada and worldwide.  While regulations exist with respect to explosive hazards, there are no clear industry guidelines dealing with air-hydrocarbon mixtures in these well-site operations.  This is mainly due to the lack of fundamental understanding of the complex ignition precesses associated with such operations.



Accordingly, the proposed research is aimed at establishing fundamental information on volatilization, oxidation and ignition characteristics of a variety of reservoir oils, from Athabasca bitumen to C5+ condensates.  Moreover, combustion characteristics of pure as well as complex mixtures of gaseous hydrocarbon/air mixtures will be examined.  Effects of important  operating parameters such as pressure, temperature, pore size will also be studied.  Based on the established information, relevant predictive models may be developed.  The established data as well as the models would be directly applicable to industry for designing safe and successful  upstream oil and gas operations.  Moreover, this information will aid in providing much-needed guidelines for dealing with air-hydrocarbon mixtures in these well site operations.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","University of Calgary",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie du p�trole, r�cup�ration du p�trole et du gaz","Combustibles et technologie de l'�nergie"
"Phase transitions are very common  phenomena arising in thermodynamics. Two important type of models are the compressible van der Waals fluid flow and the model of viscoelastic material dynamics. In the van der Waals flow, due to the variety of the absolute temperature and the non-monotony of the pressure function, the flow usually exhibits phase transitions between water, vapor and mixtures of water and vapor. While in the model of viscoelastical material dynamics, due to the change of the non-monotonic stress function, the system behaves as three phases-soft material, hard material and the mixture of soft and hard material.



Mathematically, these problems can be described as a system of partial differential equations (PDE) of mixed types. According to different values of the pressure function in the van der Waals fluid flow (correspondingly, the stress function in the viscoelastic material dynamics), the system behaves in different types of PDE: hyperbolic region (corresp. to the water phase), elliptic region (corresp. to the mixed phase of water and vapor) and another hyperbolic region (corresp. to the vapor phase). 



The study on such a mixed type system is very significant but quite difficult and challenging. Many conjecture questions are still open. In particular, when the artificial viscosity is sufficiently small, the struction of the solutions, the number of stationary solutions, the stability problems, the phase transition occurring time, and so on, all of them are unknown. To attack these problems will be our main goal in this research proposal. The adopted methods will be the combination of Liyapunov's energy functional method, Evan function method, the compactness analysis method, the method of shock wave structure, and the energy method, et al. We are also interested in the numerical computations to investigate how the phase transitions occur.

"My NSERC program investigates simple systems of nerve cells in model species of invertebrates.  I increasingly use my Discovery grant to generate three-dimensional reconstructions from serial-section electron micrographs (EMs) of identified nerve cells.  Currently I am investigating the olfactory system of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the central nervous system of the tadpole larva of the common sea squirt, Ciona intestinalis.  My lab is world expert in these approaches, and we progressively analyse the synaptic circuits of different brain regions, as part of an endeavour to understand the neural basis of behaviour.  I have extended this work as part of a recent appointment as a visiting scientist at the Janelia Farm campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute near Washington, DC, for 2 months a year.  There, I work in collaboration with computer scientists who have generated methods to speed such work considerably, using algorithmic advances to reconstruct semi-automatically the three-dimensional forms of neurons from their consecutive two-dimensional images in EMs.  This is part of Janelia Farm's vision to generate by automatic means a complete wiring diagram of the Drosophila brain.  I plan to use the software developments at Janelia Farm to enrich and accelerate my NSERC program at Dalhousie, but need workstations to run their software on our datasets.  The datasets themselves are huge, more than 1 terabyte, and require workstations with huge memory, processing speed and storage.  I propose to purchase two such advanced workstations, each complete with a large, high-resolution flat screen monitors and 2TB hard drive, to mirror the 3-D reconstruction capabilities available at Janelia Farm.  These will be used mainly by HQP working on such datasets for graduate or postdoctoral research, assisted by undergraduate helpers.","Advancement of knowledge","Dalhousie University",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)",Neurophysiologie,"Biologie animale"
"We are a group of behavioural neuroscientists who work on mammalian, avian and insect model systems, using a range of methods that require us to store samples at ultra-low temperatures (-80oC).  Our studies on a range of nervous systems and tissues require us to generate and maintain tissue and tissue extract samples, reagents, and antibodies.  These are all highly vulnerable and they are also very expensive, either to purchase or because we have invested a large amount of time or other human resources in collecting them.  All need to be stored at ultra-low temperatures.  A -80oC  machine formerly available to us is no longer available, and we have only temporary access to an existing freezer belonging to a colleague who needs it for her own program.  This is the only machine in our department.  The replacement we now seek is therefore urgent both because we lack sufficient storage space at this temperature for all our needs, and because if the one working instrument, to which we have only short-term access, were ever to break down, we would lack any access to ultralow temperatures whatsoever.  We are not able to transport frozen samples to nearby departments or buildings.  We also need access to a dry-ice (solid CO2) machine to freeze specimens rapidly prior to storage.  This cryogenic duo of equipment will support the research programs of four co-applicants and their undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral trainees, at different career stages, whose programs converge on the neural mechanisms of behaviour and immunity.

"The Earth's climate can be defined as a group of interacting systems including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, cryosphere and geosphere. Interactions amongst these are very complex and highly non-linear but can be realistically studied and understood using numerical climate models.  These provide essential tools in the study of past and future climates, and have led to the development of the UVic Earth System Climate Model (ESCM) of intermediate complexity. The UVic ESCM includes most of the important climate components while being computationally efficient, a feature that allows sensitivity analyses to be performed.

The efficiencies by which the terrestrial and ocean carbon cycles absorb anthropogenic carbon dioxide are expected to be reduced under higher atmospheric CO2 levels. A constraint in predicting such reductions is the availability of growth-limiting nutrients which has been recognized as a major unknown when modelling future climate change scenarios. None of the current coupled carbon-climate models include fully coupled nutrient cycles; during abrupt climate change they are therefore unable to address fully several key questions about terrestrial carbon exchange. 

This proposal to the Discovery Grant program requests funding for two graduate student positions, created to address two fundamental scientific questions by improving the UVic ESCM. The first involves the addition to the model of terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus cycles in order to quantify the terrestrial biogeochemical climate feedbacks during periods of abrupt climate change, while the second aims to improve understanding of the principal mechanisms that governed past (and may govern future) climate changes. Modelled responses to realistic climatic perturbations such as meltwater events or changing solar activity will be compared to observed paleoproxy data obtained from ice cores and marine sediments. Using this approach, the project will shed new light on the behaviour of the climate system and will lead to improved interpretation of paleoclimate records.

"Our forests are under increasing pressure to provide economic security through their ability to provide excellent opportunities for high quality outdoor recreation and tourism. Visual quality is paramount in this goal and any increase in visual quality that costs little in the way of traditional economic inputs via forest harvesting represents a win-win situation.  Additionally, ecological health and function of the forest is also a very important topic and has direct impacts on our long term societal resilience to weather short term disturbances such as the recent mountain pine beetle epidemic as well as longer term challenges such as climate change.  This program of research will help us to better understand how to balance these factors and therefore better steward the forests of Canada for future generations. By extending the development of a prototype application designed to automatically generate potential harvest designs, and assess them on their ability to meet visual quality targets we hope better understand how a given non-visual (economic or ecological) metric interact with visual quality and identify under which landscape conditions possible synergies or conflicts are likely to occur.  This research is organized into 4 phases: (I) implement proposed visual effect parameters and metrics into the software program, (II) conduct a preference study to evaluate visual metrics, (III) identify and include non-visual effect metrics into software, and (IV) conduct a final preference study to identify trade-off values. We are confident that this work will provide a deeper look into specific aspects of harvest design and how they affect visual quality.  More than simply investigating the visual effect of a harvest after it has been conducted, by using visualization software, we can begin to understand how a particular harvest may appear on a landscape before the harvest has occurred. This will allow us to iteratively check the ways in which disciplinary experts evaluate the harvest designs which underlie variables of interest in their area and how these relate to visual design. Furthermore, we can move to automate some of the harvest design process with the intention of increasing the visual quality of a harvest given our desire to meet various ecological or economic objectives.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","University of British Columbia",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Am�nagement forestier","G�nie forestier"

"The Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian periods (ca. 542-416 million years ago) were times of dramatically changing climate, sea level, and biodiversity. The second biggest mass extinction event in Earth history occurred near the end of the Ordovician Period and was responsible for the disappearance of approximately 85% of the species living at the time. The most important animals in the fossil record of marine plankton during these time periods was the graptolites, a group of extinct hemichordates. They were abundant, geographically widespread and evolved relatively rapidly, which means that they are excellent fossils for identifying short intervals of geologic time and correlation of those intervals over large areas of the globe. A thorough understanding of the classification, evolution, and paleobiology of these organisms, and their distribution within sedimentary strata maximizes our potential to use them to solve geological problems in areas such as tectonics and sedimentary basin history, as well as to help reconstruct the history of life. 

  My research program has several major objectives: 1) to reconstruct the evolutionary history of graptolites and other hemichordates, using extraordinarily well-preserved fossils, such as those of the Burgess Shale (British Columbia) and the Cape Phillips Formation (Nunavut); 2) to understand the history of change of graptolite biodiversity as a result of changing rates of species origination and extinction, particularly through the cycles of climatic and oceanic changes that characterized the Ordovician and Silurian periods; 3) to study the physical and chemical record preserved in rock strata to better understand the paleoenvironmental cycles and their causes; 4) to use the study of graptolites and their occurrences in sedimentary strata to improve the resolution with which we can define and subdivide geological time. By improving our resolution of geological time we can gain clearer insights into the timing of events and rates of evolutionary and paleoenvironmental processes.

"The most versatile and heavily used system in the Condensed Matter Physics thin film laboratory features a six-pocket rotatable electron-beam evaporation source that can be operated simultaneously with two thermal sources. It is used in the  work of several research groups at the University of Alberta and the National Institute for Nanotechnology, in areas ranging from fluorescent nanocrystals for light emission applications, to specimen preparation for electron microscopy in many research projects, to the development of integrated spectrometers for medical diagnostics, threat detection, and industrial process control. Virtually everything from the bell jar (originally glass, now stainless steel) to the e-gun and thermal evaporators, power supplies, thickness monitors, specimen holders, shuttering system, temperature controllers: all of it - has been upgraded to the point where we now have the most advanced system on campus. Only the high vacuum pump, absolutely necessary for operation, is original - and it is truly ancient by any standard for scientific equipment. It is, in fact, older than the principle investigator on this grant application. Although the system was well maintained over many decades, now the water cooling lines on this old pumping system are corroded and leaking. Once the cooling line leakages become unmanageable, the system will become unusable. After more than 40 years of operation, it is time to consider a replacement. We hope to replace this ancient unit with a modern, oil free vacuum pump that will not only permit continued operation of the infrastructure into the next decades, but will make it run cleaner and much more cheaply, as the new pumping unit we request requires only a minimum of consumables for maintenance and operation. That is the heart of this proposal: replacement infrastructure for more than 40-year-old equipment that will permit a heavily used lab to keep running, will improve the cleanliness of the infrastructure and therefore the quality of the science that can be done, and will represent a long term cost savings.

"Visionary Manufacturing Challenges for 2020 by the USA National Research Council points out that among all priority technology areas in manufacturing ""reconfigurable and adaptable systems"" are most important. There exist several manufacturing approaches aimed at increasing production flexibility, such as lean manufacturing, and just-in-time production. In the field of robotics, recent efforts exploit modular and reconfigurable robots (MRRs) for the purpose of enabling manufacturing flexibility. Moreover, in recent years, several manufacturing tools suppliers began to offer MRR-based solutions for design of versatile facilities that offer improved dexterity over task-specific hardware for automation. This need for MRRs will continue to grow in order to meet the projected demand for adaptable manufacturing systems in upcoming years. Therefore, the applicant's research program will focus on advancing motion planning and control methodologies of MRR to facilitate wider scale use of those systems in advanced manufacturing applications. First, the research program will focus on developing intelligent path planning methods to solve the Inverse Kinematics (IK) problem for MRRs. By incorporating adaptive niching methods, the proposed approach will be able to find multiple solutions of the IK problem for configurations that have no closed form analytical solution. Secondly, the program will target the development of configuration-independent robust control methods for MRRs. Finally, the research program will focus on development of configuration optimization strategies for MRRs that utilize novel GA-based task-based algorithms. The proposed algorithms will utilize the multi-solution IK solver developed by the applicant during the research program to identify the most suitable MRR configuration for a given task. Through the successful execution of the aforementioned milestones, this research program will enable the utilization of MRRs in a wide variety of manufacturing applications.

"In order to explain the complex behavior of matter, physicists invoke the concept of ""reduction"" - examining a material's constituents down to finer and finer details.  At some point we quickly reach the quantum mechanical building blocks of matter itself: molecules, atoms, and even electrons.  Rather than ""solving"" for a material's behavior, this approach can lead to even more questions.  How can all of the complex phenomena that we observe - electrical current, crystal structure, superfluidity - emerge from such a small number of initial building blocks?  Unfortunately, to solve for the collective behavior of these constituents is impossible, since the quantum mechanical equations that underlie their interactions are vastly complex.  Here, we turn to the abilities of high-performance computing.  With smart algorithms, we are able to solve for the behavior of an amazingly large number (millions or more) of quantum particles using a classical computer.  Although small compared to the familiar number of atoms in a typical object (10^23), this number can speak volumes about the nature of quantum materials, through sophisticated analysis.  Indeed, as we enter the age of nano-technology, we find that the number of particles that we can simulate is approaching the number of particles in real nanoscale systems - positioning us to make a unique connection between theory and experiment, potentially accelerating the scale of nanoscale research in Canada to unprecedented levels.  More generally, it is the goal of this research program to push the frontiers of what is capable in computing, in order to provide physical explanations for exotic behavior in real materials.  High-performance computers will probe the very nature of the complex quantum interactions in microscopic models of a host of intriguing materials: supersolid Helium, magnetic matter, ultracold atoms in optical traps, molecular conductors, and superconductors.  The task is challenging but the potential impact is large: denser energy storage, ultra-efficient solar cells, superconductor power grids, revolutionary magnetic media. The frontier awaits, and with luck we may find that in the end, the whole is indeed more than the sum of the quantum parts.","Physical sciences","University of Waterloo",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Physique de la mati�re condens�e","Physique de la mati�re condens�e"

"The main goal of the project is to develop methods of stochastic analysis that could further be applied to different areas of financial mathematics, investment and strategic management. 



We will study solutions of multidimensional stochastic differential equations with respect to semimartingales. The main research interest will be focused on comparison properties of solutions of these equations. We expect to get a general multidimensional comparison theorem under the so-called monotonicity condition. It will then be applied to a determination of bounds of option prices in a very general semimartingale market. It is expected that this approach will lead to a comparative option pricing theory that will allow us to determine reasonable bounds of option prices without routine calculations. We will combine this approach with other methods (market completions, analytical probabilistic techniques etc) to refine our estimates for option prices.



Another area of the project will focus on option pricing and imperfect hedging by means of risk measures. We will pay our attention to the so-called Conditioned Value at Risk (CVaR) which will serve as a selection criterion for choosing an optimal hedging portfolio. As a result, option pricing and hedging will be reduced to an optimization problem. Concrete pricing formulas will be received in the framework of the Black-Scholes model, the model based on telegraph processes etc. Risk measures will also be applied to performance analysis and strategic management (mergers and acquisitions).



The project can be regarded as interdisciplinary research combining methods of stochastic analysis, statistics, financial mathematics and risk management.

The targeted materials mostly consist in dielectric matrices with embedded magnetic and metallic particles (nanowires or nanoclusters). The control of the properties, essentially the impedance and the propagation constant, will be achieved through the control of the magnetic and dielectric properties of the materials. The electrical impedance will be studied, both theoretically and experimentally, as a function of the frequency, the magnetic field and the temperature.  It is anticipated that the magnetic field tuneability, along with the proper choice of material composition and geometry, will allow an unprecedented degree of liberty, and provide new engineering concepts for the development of a new class of materials for applications in communication and information technologies.

"Fear is perhaps our most primal emotion. Adaptive behavioral responses to fear-provoking situations promote survival. The wrong behavioral response can be costly.  To study fear, I use tests that tap into rats' defensive responses to aversive, threatening situations.  All animals, including humans, exhibit a spectrum of adaptive defensive responses to threat, ranging from increased vigilance and risk-assessment to escape and defensive attack.  But how does the brain select the most appropriate response for survival? According to one theory, the lateral septum evaluates the emotional relevance of incoming sensory input from the hippocampus and conveys this information on to hypothalamic areas that control the expression of behaviors important to survival. The lateral septum receives massive input from the hippocampus, and extensive evidence confirms that those two structures contribute to fear.  However, far less is known about whether the lateral septum and hypothalamus work together to select appropriate fear-related behaviors. Specific regions of the lateral septum are uniquely connected to specific hypothalamic nuclei. Our recent work suggests that the lateral septum caudal-lateral hypothalamic circuit influences rats' defensive responses to novel/open environments, whereas the lateral septum rostral-anterior hypothalamic circuit influences their defensive responses to discrete, localizable threat stimuli. I plan to further investigate this possibility by selectively interrupting the flow of information across the individual circuits. I can turn off specific parts of each circuit by injecting small amounts of muscimol (a drug that acts like GABA) into the area of interest and then observe how these local injections change rats' defensive responses to a variety of fear-provoking situations. By using techniques from immunohistochemistry, I can determine some of the neurochemical characteristics of the circuits. The results of these experiments will provide a fuller understanding into how the brain processes information about threats and produces appropriate defensive behavior.  More broadly, this work will provide a general framework for understanding some of the changes in brain that might underlie pathological fears and anxiety disorders in humans.

"The ultimate goal of this Discovery program is to greatly accelerate the innovation cycle for materials processes in general.  The approach proposed is based on intense experimentation and advanced, cross disciplinary scaling methodologies to model multicoupled, multiphysics, non-equilibrium materials processes.  The methodologies developed will be of direct help in relating processing, structure, and properties to each other at a quantitative level.  In the short term, the focus will be on arc welding and plasma arc manufacturing processes.  The training aspect of this program will expose future highly qualified personnel to real-life materials processes that are very difficult to idealize, yet quantitative predictions can be made by identifying the essential features of these processes.

     The advanced methodologies to be employed consist of a combination of numerical modeling and experimental measurements within the framework of scaling techniques.  The implementation and development of scaling techniques is a distinguishing aspect of this proposal, and is especially suitable to addresses the complex nature of materials processing, particularly welding, where heat transfer, fluid flow, electromagnetism, free surfaces, and phase transformations, exist simultaneously and are tightly coupled.

     The applications targeted for the short term are very relevant to the Canadian economy.  Arc welding, for example, is the most common and flexible type of permanent joining, and it is used in applications of enormous impact in Canada such as the joining of pipelines, the construction and planned repair of mining and agricultural equipment, the joining of sophisticated alloys in power plants and chemical processing plants, the joining of steels and light alloys in cars and other transportation vehicles, and the joining of structural members in ships, bridges, tall buildings, and other large civil structures.  In the province of Alberta alone, the metal products fabrication industry (which relies heavily on arc welding) is expected to grow to over $7.5 billion by 2009.","Materials sciences","University of Alberta",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Science et technologie des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"

"Grapevine Rupestris stem pitting-associated virus (GRSPaV) is a viral pathogen associated with the important rugose wood disease complex of grapevines.  GRSPaV has been commonly detected in commercial grape varieties as well in rootstocks and wild grapes. GRSPaV is classified as a member of the Foveavirus genus within the Flexiviridae family. GRSPaV has an RNA genome with five open reading frames that encode a replicase polyprotein, three movement proteins commonly known as Triple Gene Block (TGB) proteins, and the capsid protein. Since the identification of GRSPaV in 1998, much progress has been made concerning the genetic diversity and population structure of the virus. Serological and nucleic acid-based methods have also been developed and successfully used for the rapid and reliable detection of GRSPaV. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern viral replication and movement have not been understood for GRSPaV or for other members of the Foveavirus genus. In this proposal, we will conduct three areas of research as follows: (A) to investigate the composition, targeting and subcellular locale of the replicase complex; (B) to study the subcellular localization and potential interactions of the TGB movement proteins encoded by GRSPaV; and (C) to establish an effective experimental host with which the mechanisms of infection and pathogenesis can be studied. Outcomes of the proposed research will generate novel information on GRSPaV, the Foveavirus genus, and Flexiviridae family. In the long-run, a better understanding of the virus would lead to effective strategies for the control of viruses and diseases they cause.

"We seek NSERC support for a research vehicle, to be used extensively by two University of Windsor research teams in the Guanacaste Conservation Area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Costa Rica. The research that will be made possible by the purchase of this vehicle will involve extensive field studies on the reproduction, vocal communication, and visual communication of tropical animals, as well as comparative studies between temperate and tropical organisms, which will be conducted by the co-applicant's research teams. 

     This vehicle will be used extensively by the co-applicants' research teams for numerous field projects: (1) The ecology and evolution of duetting in three neotropical wrens (Thryothorus rufalbus, T. modestus, Campylorhynchus rufinucha); (2) The function of song in a suboscine antbird, the Barred Antshrike (Thamnophilus doliatus); (3) Vocal communication in the threatened Great Currasow (Crax rubra); (4) Social networks in lek-mating Long-tailed Manakins (Chiroxiphia linearis); (5) The evolution of sexual ornaments in Royal Flycatchers (Onychorhynchus coronatus); (6) Visual and vocal signalling in a neotropical toad Bufo luetkenii. The success of these field studies require the use of a field vehicle to effectively travel from one field site to another, thus maximizing the time devoted to research instead of travel.

     Over the last six years, the two co-applicants have spent over $30,000 in car rental fees while conducting research at this site. This research has directly given rise to 18 high-calibre publications, with many more in review, and the training of many young Canadian scientists in tropical research techniques. The purchase of a field vehicle will allow the two co-applicants' research programs to continue with a major cost savings. We estimate that during the next ten years - the estimated life of the vehicle - the amount of money saved from rental fees will be directly involved in gathering data for four post-doctoral researchers, eight Ph.D. students, twelve M.Sc. students, and twenty undergraduate thesis students.

"We focus on the development of a deformable laryngoscope, which has different clinical applications,

including first use intubations, bariatric surgery, and cervical spine immobilization. Currently, laryngoscopes

have a fixed geometry and a rigid structure. Their main limitation is that they cannot adapt to different shapes

of patients' mouths. In addition, they do not provide any force feedback to the paramedics who use it. Being

rigid, they can also damage a patient's oral cavity if handled improperly. We have developed a novel, highly

deformable fluidic actuator (DFA) capable of displaying large deformations. Its design is based on a

micro-channel embedded on a polymeric substrate, which is fixed to an inextensible, but bendable, backbone.

The DFA would be suitable as a substitute for the final segment of laryngoscopes and it could be used to lift

the tongue to clear a patient's airway. The DFA can be manufactured by using biocompatible and inexpensive

polymers and thus could be suitable for commercial biomedical applications.

The proposed research has the potential to provide substantial benefits for Canada as it has numerous

applications for medicine including: (1) intubation for mechanical ventilation; (2) intubation for anesthesia

administration; (3) inspection of throat pain; (4) evaluation issues in throat swallowing; (5) analysis of

obstruction masses in the airway; and (6) inspection of vocal cords.","Medical equipment and apparatus","Simon Fraser University",1,"EGP   ","Engage Grants Program                                                                               ","Conception et fabrication","Conception et fabrication"
"International interest in climbing mechanisms is growing rapidly within the scientific and industrial communities. The research and development efforts in this field may be categorized under four key areas: 1) servicing (e.g., maintenance of skyscrapers, ships' hulls, nuclear plants, etc.); 2) rescue (e.g., during fire, earthquakes, landslides, etc.); 3) security (e.g., surveillance, inspection, and military operations in buildings , extreme natural environments, etc.); and 4) space (e.g., planetary exploration, Intra-Vehicular Activities, Extra-Vehicular Activities, etc.). 



The research proposed in this project will focus on the synthesis of a robust and energy efficient climbing robotic mechanism based on a spider-inspired adhesion system. All components of the mechanism, the mechanical design, sensing, and actuation systems, will be spider-inspired. During the scope of this research program, the interaction between the mechanism and the adhering surface will be investigated. To maximise contact surface area, the research will focus on an under-actuated system capable of complying with both surface roughness and geometry. The kinematics, stiffness and dynamics of the synthesized mechanism will be investigated in order to optimize its design. The robotic system will be designed to prevent adhesion failure as falls generally cause unacceptable damage. 



The proposed research will be relevant from scientific, engineering, and industrial perspectives. The scientific value of this research will be our improved understanding of the phenomena governing locomotion on vertical and inclined surfaces. The engineering value will be the development of new methods and standards for the design of climbing mechanisms. The industrial value will be the tangible solutions for  improving applications in the servicing, rescue, security, and space industries.

"A recent review of the evidence for Holocene glacier fluctuations in western Canada recommends that future efforts should focus on documenting glacier fluctuations in eastern Yukon and the ranges in the Northwest Territories since little work has been completed in this region to date. One promising region is centered around the Keele Peak region (N 63 deg 26', W 130 deg 19') in the Hess Mountains, Yukon. Based on an analysis of pollen records, substantial climate change affected the adjacent Mackenzie Mountains during the Holocene. Given the location of the study area at high latitude in the Northern Hemisphere, it is believed that orbital forcing caused glaciers to expand from minimal extents in the early Holocene to maximum downvalley positions during the Little Ice Age. I aim to test the role that orbital forcing played on glacier activity at high latitudes by completing work in the Keele Peak area and at sites in southern Patagonia (proposed in my Discovery Grant). If orbital forcing is a primary factor that explains long-term behavior of glaciers during the Holocene, then the records of glacier activity in the northern and southern Hemispheres should diverge. The development of continuous glacier proxies from the Hess mountains should also provide insight into the timing, amplitude, and duration of Holocene climate change that affected this portion of the Canadian Cordillera.The research that I propose directly benefits Canadians by helping to understand the behavior of the climate system. A careful study of past glacier fluctuations can help assess the magnitude, rapidity, and duration of past climatic events. These events provide valuable scenarios for calibrating and verifying  general and regional circulation models. This research will provide undergraduate and graduate students with appropriate training in northern environments to minimize the projected Canadian deficit of highly qualified personnel (HQP) in the next decade. In addition to HQP training and publication of research findings, I plan to deliver several public talks about the research completed in the Keele Peak region to the communities of Ross River and Whitehorse.

"Mountain glaciers are sensitive indicators of climate change. Moraines, trimlines, and forests overrun by glaciers during an advance provide opportunities to reconstruct past glacier activity.  Proglacial lake sediments represent another valuable proxy of glacier fluctuations because more extensive ice cover should increase the proportion of substrate subject to glacier erosion. An advantage that lake sediments afford over terrestrial glacier proxies is the continuity that they can provide. In addition to long-term changes in ice cover, glacigenic sediments can also be used to infer hydro-climatic conditions that favor episodic delivery of clastic sediments to the lake basin.  Progress in the use of these unique sedimentary records to reconstruct glacier activity and events such as floods requires an appreciation of the role that changes in sediment storage and availability play in controlling clastic sedimentation rates. Over the next five years I plan to advance our understanding of the relation between climate, glaciers, and downvalley sedimentation in western North America and Patagonia. My proposed research has two objectives: 1) to asses the relation between climate, glacier fluctuations and proglacial sedimentation at time scales of years to decades; and 2) to document the controls of clastic sedimentation at time scales of centuries to millennia. The research that I propose will help assess the relation between sediment export and glacier dynamics. Given the strong interplay between climate, glacier nourishment, and sediment yield, this work will provide insight into long-term changes in glacier extent and the external factors that drive these changes at high latitudes. The Holocene Epoch includes numerous climate events that provide important analogues for potential future behavior. These events also provide valuable scenarios for calibrating and verifying general and regional circulation models. Finally, undergraduate and graduate students are integral to successfully undertake the proposed research. Their involvement should help minimize the projected Canadian deficit of highly qualified personnel in the next decade.

"THE NATURE OF THE WORK TO BE DONE: Tissue engineering holds great promise as an alternative strategy to current treatment modalities of diseased or otherwise failed tissues. Most strategies of tissue engineering rely on porous 3-dimensional scaffolds as templates to guide tissue regeneration. These scaffolds play the role of a synthetic extracellular matrix that facilitates the organization of cells into a 3-dimensional architecture and address the mechanical stimuli that rule the growth and formation of the desired tissue. The work proposed here involves the design of novel scaffolding materials from naturally occurring amino acids. 

WHY AND TO WHOM THE RESEARCH IS IMPORTANT: Every year nearly 23,000 Canadians undergo coronary artery bypass surgeries. With the rapid growth of the elderly segment of the population, the number of coronary artery interventions is expected to increase dramatically. Although prosthetic vascular grafts are still in wide clinical use, such grafts often do not fit well and do not respond appropriately to physiological conditions in the native tissue they replaced. Patient-specific tissue-engineered blood vessels will eliminate the need of drugs since the tissue will not be rejected. This reduces the impact of the surgical procedure and improves quality of life to patients. To achieve all these, scaffolding material design is at the heart of tissue engineering research.

HOW CANADA WILL BENEFIT: Tissue engineering is a new and vibrant area of research with great potential to revolutionize current treatment modalities. Thus the design of novel scaffolding materials is a significant benefit to Canada to play a leading role in this area.

THE ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES: Tissue engineering  strategies rely on the choice of appropriate biomaterials that will act as a temporary support for the cells. Since scaffold-guided tissue engineering is by far the most plausible strategy, the design of novel and new classes of biodegradable biomaterials with biological recognition capability could provide key information to advance in this promising field of research.

"The long-term objective of this research program is to better understand how the brain interprets various types of stressors and coordinates internal bodily responses as well as behavioral outputs to cope with the stressors.  It is of course clear that adequate responses to stressors serve to protect the organism. Conversely, inadequate responses to stressors are thought to result in bodily damage, either due to failure to protect the body from stressor-elicited deleterious effects and/or mobilization of a cascade of responses that directly harms the body.  In this project, rats will be exposed to stressors of various types including: (a) psychological stressors (e.g. exposure of a rat to its predator, the cat or ferret), (b) restraint stress (which has psychological as well as physical attributes), and (c) direct physiological stressors (e.g. exposure to immune-type stressors), and the responses of the rats monitored. We have deliberately selected to study these types of naturalistic stressors, as they are ethologically sound and more likely to yield heuristically and practically useful information. The brain utilizes various chemical signals (neurotransmitters) to communicate not only with the rest of the body but also between different regions of the brain itself. One particular class of such transmitter molecules that seem important in responding to stress are small hormone-like molecules called peptides. We are able to monitor the release of various brain transmitters/peptides, in freely behaving animals - without them being 'aware' of this process. We will also monitor the release of various hormones and assess the level of anxiety/fear in these animals.  Indeed, stressor exposure (be it illness-related, psychological or physical) often results in other disorders or diseases, including depression, anxiety disorders and/or cardiovascular diseases. It is hoped that a better understanding of how the brain chemically interprets and reacts to various stressors may shed new light on how to manage or cope with stressors most effectively and how to correct or treat maladaptive stress responses.

"L'utilisation de ventilateurs dans le domaine r�sidentiel est tr�s r�pandue.  Comme ils sont petits et qu'on ne les voie pas, l'�nergie qu'ils consomment n'est jamais apparente et souvent n�glig�e.

"The potential for earthquakes to cause loss of life, structural damage and interruption of service is of great concern, and has gained increased awareness in the development of performance based design of structures. Numerous devices (e.g., elastomeric and magnetorheological dampers) have been recently developed as a means of reducing the seismic hazard in structures. To enable widespread use of these load-rate dependent devices, it is necessary to develop performance based design codes which require knowledge of structural performance from real-time tests of structures equipped with these devices. The real-time pseudodynamic (PSD) and hybrid PSD test methods offer ideal ways to address this need, where in the latter method only the critical components are physically tested and the remaining part of the structure is modeled in a computer. In real-time testing, the need to operate hydraulic actuators at fast rates inevitably brings along control issues; and unless the time delays (due to actuator response time, communication, computing time, etc.) are accurately compensated, accuracy and stability problems are likely to occur. The challenges include accurate control of multiple actuators that introduce variable time delay, representative modeling of the analytical substructure and its execution in real-time, and the lack of a standardized tool to establish the quality of the real-time test results. The proposed research program aims to gain an in-depth understanding necessary to handle the current challenges; to develop methodologies to overcome them; and thereby to enable a broader domain of application for these test methods. By presenting structural engineers with enhanced testing methodologies, the proposed program will contribute to the design and understanding of next generation structures.

"Reproductive success in marine invertebrates depends on the synchronization of gamete synthesis and spawning. Mechanisms through which this is achieved involve a number of steps, including perception of environmental cues and interactions via chemical signals. My research has been aimed at determining the roles played by exogenous and endogenous factors in the reproductive success of boreal and tropical species. Initial work with sea cucumbers has revealed that inter-individual chemical communication acts together with environmental factors to ensure synchronous gametogenesis and mass-spawning and that perivisceral coelomic fluid becomes bioactive during spawning events. We also found that many echinoderms and molluscs display lunar and circadian rhythms of aggregation and reproduction. Due to a recent breakthrough in the holding of deep-sea invertebrates, a new segment of my work focuses on the factors underlying reproduction in bathyal species, which are presumably exposed to limited environmental fluctuations, yet may still exhibit seasonal breeding cycles. The short term goals of the present research program are to: 1) find evidence of chemical communication in other marine invertebrates using the techniques developed for sea cucumbers; 2) compare the importance of environmental and chemical cues in the reproductive processes of species from various depths with different breeding periodicities; 3) investigate the level of reproductive synchrony in deep-sea species and elucidate the factors involved in ensuring it; 4) refine knowledge of the bioactive properties of body components over the reproductive cycle using multilevel analyses and bioassays; and 5) investigate the concept of ""sentinel"" individuals (believed to be more receptive to environmental cues, and to use chemical signals to relay those to conspecifics). The long term goals are to clarify the respective roles played by external factors and interspecific exchanges and investigate how the former can perhaps be translocated via the latter. Better knowledge of biological rhythms and chemical communication in benthic animals could help devise new aquaculture techniques and improved ways to protect marine habitats from environmental disturbances.","Advancement of knowledge","Memorial University of Newfoundland",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Reproduction animale","Biologie animale"

"The neurons in our brain have the ability to modify their connections, a phenomenon termed brain plasticity that allows learning of new abilities, adaptation to different environments and, to some extent, recovery following injury. The emergence of new neuroimaging and neurostimulation techniques has played a pivotal role in the progress of our knowledge of brain plasticity. One particular technique, called transcranial magnetic stimulation, consist of stimulating the areas of the brain involved in movement control and recording the contractions of the muscles that are artificially evoked by those stimulations. This allows us to make a ""map"" of how a given muscle is represented in the brain, and then to study how this map changes following different events. Assessing the scope of these changes and understanding their behavioural relevance remains, however, an important challenge. One example of the rudimentary nature of current approaches to measuring plasticity is that very different events, such immobilization and motor training, often appear to result in similar changes in the maps, despite obvious differences in their effects on motor performance. Currently, therefore, we cannot imply a simple relationship between changes observed in the brain and their effect on motor capacities. The goal of my research program is to understand how plasticity in areas of the brain that control movement affects motor capacities, and to identify the optimal way to measure this plasticity.  As brain plasticity can have both positive and negative effects on motor behaviour, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of this phenomenon and to refine its measurement, as this knowledge will allow brain plasticity to be predictably modulated in the future.","Medical and health sciences","Universit� Laval",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Syst�mes moteurs et performance",Psychologie

"    )	Behavior in animals is produced by the central nervous system (CNS) and is strongly influenced by hormones that can act within the CNS, on neuromuscular targets and on visceral organs. The ultimate goal of my research is to understand the mechanisms through which hormones modulate behavior.   My research program takes an integrated approach to this problem by studying behavior at the level of whole animals, identifying hormones and neurotransmitters that underlie behavior, and uncovering the mechanisms of action of hormones and transmitters at the cellular and sub-cellular levels.   I use invertebrates as model systems for study.  Much of my work has focused on ""FMRFamide-like peptides"", which appear to be present in all animals.  These chemicals regulate the heart, vascular tissues, nerve cells, muscle cells and visceral organs.  

    )	During the next 5 years, I will examine the biochemical processes that allow specific neuropeptides to enhance communication between neurons and their target cells at chemical synapses.  I will also determine whether different peptides play essentially the same role and, thus, are essentially redundant, or whether different peptides act on specific cells.  I will also examine aggressive interactions between members of the same species and determine whether or not such behaviors are modified by neuropeptide hormones.  This work will provide a more complete picture of how biochemical and cellular actions of hormones are integrated to produce and/or modify behavior. The proposed experiments will be performed on crayfish and fruitflies, which offer advantages of having simple, well-studied nervous systems and stereotypical behaviors that are easy to identify and quantify. Fruitflies also have a completely sequenced genome and many mutant and genetically engineered strains that can be used as tools for investigating specific biochemical pathways.

    )	This proposal will support cellular and behavioral neuroscience research in Canada and will produce highly qualified Canadian researchers.","Advancement of knowledge","Brock University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Biologie animale","Biologie animale"

"Nanotechnology has now emerged as a important research branch leading to potentially major breakthoughs in many areas of economic and social benefit.  The ability to make materials that can execute specific tasks is one of the main objectives in materials science research. The manipulation of matter at the ""nanoscale"" (length scale approaching that of molecules), is now recognized as an excellent approach to make materials (known as nanomaterials) whose reactivity can be precisely tuned. In this research, we aim to prepare highly efficient nanomaterials that can be used to improve the health of the environment, as well as to make certain industrial processes more efficient.

   Our general approach is to prepare ""sponge-like"" nanomaterials that contain numerous pore channels with nano-sized openings.  Using the tools of chemistry, the surface of these pore channels will be modified to make the materials active for specific environmental and industrial tasks.

   Some of our specific environmental goals include the design of nanomaterials that can remove toxic compounds such as heavy metals and pesticides from water systems, and to clean up toxic gas emissions from mine smelters.  We will also design nanomaterials that can improve the efficiency of converting ores into metal products, so that these processes become less energy-intensive and less polluting.

"Canada needs to coordinate hydrogen and fuel cell research efforts at individual academic institutions with future and ongoing government research programs. Wherever possible, these efforts should be aligned with Canadian industry needs. The present proposal describes a one-day workshop aimed at addressing these needs. 



Canada has enjoyed a leading position in the world as an early developer and adopter of fuel cell technology, and Canadian companies are among the most advanced developers of the related products.  However, we now risk lagging behind increasingly competitive international competition from, for example, Japan, Germany, and the US. This risk requires the identification of well-defined niches where Canadian leadership can be secured and consolidated.



A national, coordinated strategy is required to maximize the scarce resources that are available.  Aligning ongoing academic research (high-risk, high payback) with the long-term goals of industry (commercialization, safety, reliability, etc.) is crucial. Such coordination will assist in the design of future mid term government research, and provide a consistent platform for the development of new projects under NSERC support.  These combined efforts can deliver on the needs of Canadian industry in an effective and timely manner.

"The energy system links human activity to planetary equilibria. This connection has fostered two of the most colossal challenges in recorded history. The first is the prospect of environmental and economic devastation due to anthropogenic climate disruption (e.g., from fossil fuel combustion and changes in land use). The second is the potential for geopolitical conflict due to the maldistribution and depletion of scarce resources  (e.g., fresh water and oil). 



This research identifies electrochemical energy conversion as a viable, peaceful, and efficient option to enable a sustainable energy system.  It focuses on two main areas: Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) reliability and durability, and hydrogen generation. Reliability and durability will be improved by obtaining localised information on the core PEMFC components (membranes, catalyst layers, electrode materials, etc).



Fuel cell testing and diagnostics is one of the few hydrogen-technology areas where Canada still has undisputed international leadership. The fundamental research in hardware and techniques (�4.1), new EIS methodologies and algorithms (�4.2), and new hydrogen generation methods (�4.3) will generate new knowledge in important scientific areas (clean and low-carbon energy technologies). At the end of year 5, I expect to integrate the results from �4.1 and �4.2 to propose embedded hardware and control algorithms in real fuel cell products. In the mean time, the new knowledge on fuel cell durability and reliability will maintain and solidify Canadian leadership in an increasingly competitive global arena.","Energy storage and conversion","University of British Columbia",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie m�canique","G�nie m�canique"

"Any quantum mechanical system must be regarded as being in constant interactions with an environment. This is due to two facts: Firstly, it is impossible to isolate completely a system from its surroundings (which cannot be controlled in general, and which influence the system in a non-negligible way). Secondly, any observation of a quantum mechanical system is brought about by an interaction with an environment (measuring device). It is therefore not surprising that the theory of open quantum systems, which analyzes environment-induced effects on systems, receives much attention in mathematical physics.

     The rigorous theory of open quantum systems is currently experiencing significant progress. The main driving force is the development of suitable modern mathematical tools. Those tools are situated at the intersection of spectral theory of evolution groups, the theory of operator algebras, scattering theory, the theory of quantum resonances, and quantum field theory. Modern applications are found in quantum computing, quantum information theory and the theory of quantum measurement.

     A recently developed, new approach to the topic has allowed us to obtain a  precise, quantifyable description of the process of return to equilibrium (stability of equilibria), and it has explained the emergence and the properties of asymptotic states far from equilibrium. An important achievement of this theory for physics is the derivation of macroscopic laws of thermodynamics and electricity, starting from a microscopic, hamiltonian quantum statistical description of the system. These laws are expressed as relations bewteen quantities such as temperature, entropy, density, and fluxes of heat and of charge.

     The research proposed in this project will further develop, extend and solidify the mathematical theory of open quantum systems. This is done by considering new classes of physical models and by developing new mathematical techniques. The results are of interest to a wide variety of mathematicians and physicists.

"As Life Science Research has developed over the past half-century, there has been an exponential growth in the application of fluorescence methods to the study of biological systems. Undoubtedly, fluorescence spectroscopy, including time-resolved fluorescence, is considered to be a primary tool in biochemistry, cell biology, and biophysics.  In fact, fluorescence is now a dominant force that is used extensively in biotechnology, medical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, forensics, genetic analysis, cellular trafficking, and protein biochemistry, to name only a few.  Most recently, fluorescence resonance energy transfer has undergone a renaissance in its application to cell biology and has appeared as its relative known as BRET, conducted with sophisticated confocal microscopy, which allows in vivo study of protein-protein interaction networks. Furthermore, fluorescence detection is highly sensitive, and is often possible at picomolar concentrations.  This research proposal is for a high-resolution and fully automated QuantaMaster-40 (QM) T-format, fluorescence spectrophotometer manufactured by PTI Inc. in London, Ontario.  This instrument would be unique at the University of Guelph campus as it is capable of both excitation and emission scanning, time-based (kinetic) measurements, thermal ramping (Peltier control), titration and polarization experiments, in a fully automated platform.  The automation is particularly appealing because it means that routine measurements of ligand-binding constants can be conducted by a computer rather than a technician or graduate student standing over the instrument all day. The automation is made possible through the computer control of shutters, stepper motors, sample turret, polarizers, Peltier thermoelectric, and titration devices, but it does not come at the expense of sensitivity and resolution; hence the PTI QM-40 merges the best of both worlds.  This spectrometer is expected to save researchers in the labs of numerous University investigators, literally thousands of hours each year due to the ultra-high sensitivity and fully automated features of the QM-40 instrument, while at the same time, increasing the productivity of highly qualified research personnel.

"Colicins are toxic proteins produced by certain strains of E. coli during bacterial cell growth and they are often produced in response to a host of metabolic challenges, including DNA damage, anaerobiosis, catabolite repression and nutrient depletion. Colicin E1 (colE1) is a member of the channel-forming colicins, which also includes colicins A, B, Ia, Ib, N and K. The three-dimensional structures of colicins reveal the presence of three domains:  receptor binding, translocation and channel domains. The receptor-binding domain initiates toxin entry into target cells by binding with the vitamin B12 receptor on the bacterial outer membrane.  Next, the translocation domain associates with the trimeric �-barrel TolC outer membrane receptor, through which the colicin is transported into the periplasm of the target bacterium. In a series of steps, colE1 sequentially unfolds, binds and spontaneously inserts into the membrane to form a closed channel state.  The channel opens in the presence of a trans-negative membrane potential and causes depolarization of the host cell cytoplasmic membrane through the escape of cellular ions such as Na+, K+ and H+. 

Objectives: The overall goals of our NSERC-funded research program are:

(1) To determine the membrane-bound topology of the colE1 channel in the closed state,

(2) To develop new fluorescence methods for the elucidation of the colE1 membrane-bound structure, 

(3) To reveal the molecular details of the effect of a membrane potential on the structure and function of the colE1 ion channel with application to membrane proteins, in general.

Significance:  The proposed studies will provide molecular insight into the channel states of colE1. Since NMR and X-ray studies have failed to produce high-resolution structures of the membrane-bound states, it is necessary to employ other approaches to provide ""low-resolution"" data, but important information for the understanding of colicin function. Furthermore, it is likely that we will produce a general method for the study of membrane potential on the structure and function of both integral and peripheral membrane proteins.

"All organisms, be they flies or people, have physical characteristics (phenotypes) that distinguish them from other flies, people, or that distinguish flies from people.  These characteristics are, in part, the product of heritable differences (genotypes), but relatively little is known about the connection between genotype and phenotype.  In many cases we can expect that a phenotype is the product of multiple genes interacting as a network.  My research program investigates a network of metabolic enzymes in the fruit fly that share the cofactor, NADP, as a model system to explain genotype-phenotype connections in general.  This grant application will describe two main aims that are the foundation of my long-term research program: 

    Aim 1) Quantify interactions between NADP(H) network members in the fruit fly D. melanogaster.  I will quantifying interactions between the NADP(H) enzymes using wild-caught and laboratory-engineered flies.  The project will quantify interactions within the network across fly life stages and environmental conditions combining techniques from genetics and biochemistry.

    Aim 2) Determination of the level of constancy of observed interactions between NADP(H) enzymes across species.  I will determinethe degree of similarity in the interactions between the NADP(H) enzymes, quantified in Aim 1, are across species.  This will be done by comparing and contrasting associations and interactions among the enzymes between the closely related cosmopolitan fruit fly species D. melanogaster and D. simulans, and across a trio of fly species native to North America and common in Sudbury Ontario, D. affinis, D. naragansette and D. algonquin.  Results from this comparison will directly improve our understanding of the consistency of networks across species and the utility of model organisms in general.  

The results from these two Aims will combine to further our understanding of metabolic networks, biological networks in general, and the constancy of network interactions across species.

"Nature presents us with materials showing a remarkable variety of physical, chemical and biological properties. These biomaterials achieve their highly specialized properties through hierarchical assembly involving structural elements at different length scales, from the nanoscale up to the macroscale. 



Our research aims to understand how the chemical interactions between ""soft"" (protein) and ""hard"" (mineral) components lead to composite supramolecular assemblies with particular properties.  In addition to creating new materials, we are also developing new methodology to characterize these materials, such as force spectroscopy.



In the longer term, we will gain a better understanding of general protein mineralization processes that are at the core of many important physiological processes. Some are beneficial (such as bone growth and development)  while others are pathological (such as artery hardening).  Understanding the fundamental process behind protein  mineralization may lead to future therapies for conditions such as osteoporosis or arthritis.  In the nearer term,  this understanding can lead to better artificial biomaterials to enhance the biocompatibility of prosthetics.

"Conventionally filament winding machines are commonly used for the production of piping and pressure vessels. Recently, researchers have begun utilizing filament winding for novel applications, such as filament-wound biomedical composite structures (e.g. bone replacement and rehabilitation). The geometry of such structures requires filament winding facilities with sophisticated, state-of-the-art controllers which allow users to control almost every aspect of the production process, such as fiber feed path and fiber tensioning. The applicants are conducting research involving the production and testing of filament-wound biomechanical structures, and a number of additional topics concerning filament-wound composite components. Hence, the applicants' research requires a state-of-the-art control system for an existing filament winding system. This equipment is critical to the work of a number of students working on these research projects.

"Forests support about 65% of the world's terrestrial taxa. Conserving functional and diverse forests is crucial. Most governmental programs have so far focused on creating protected areas to achieve this objective, but with more than 92% of the world's forests outside such areas, this will not suffice. Pristine forests around the globe are steadily declining, with virtually none left in most of Europe and many parts of the globe. The aim of this research program is to improve our understanding of complex natural forest systems which are being adverselely affected by forest management, pollution and climate change. The theoretical and practical understanding gained from this research will enable us to better meet the increasing challenges of managing forest ecosytems for resiliency.

The four objectives of this research program are: (1) to investigate the functional relationships among different tree species in natural forests and mixed plantations; (2) to characterize and compare forest complexity between managed and unmanaged forests within and among boreal, temperate and tropical biomes; (3) to investigate mechanisms of tree species coexistence in natural and managed forests; and (4) to develop a new silviculture for managing complexity. For each objective, various hypotheses will be tested using both experimental and modeling approaches. This proposed research program will investigate novel theoretical and practical questions and methodologies regarding (a) facilitation, complementarity and inhibition among tree species growing in complex forest communities; (b) mechanisms of coexistence of various tree species at various spatial and temporal scales, and under homogeneous vs heterogeneous environmental conditions; (c) how functional, structural and compositional complexity varies at different spatial and temporal scales under various forest management approaches both within and among various biomes; and (d) the development of new silvicultural approaches that incorporate the notions of complex system theory for managing forest stands to maintain as much complexity as possible.

"Brain plasticity involves a number of processes that reshape the neuronal networks to allow new pathways to be established or existing pathways to be remodeled. These processes require metabolic energy and the ubiquitous energy substrate for the brain is glucose. For a number of years, I have been studying glucose transporters that are involved in the facilitated transport of glucose into brain cells. I have recently found that the density of the GLUT1 glucose transporter increases in a number of brain regions following training in an operant bar-pressing task. So, there is some evidence that plastic changes of glucose transporters may provide the additional energy to allow the remodeling processes involving dendritic sprouting, synapse remodeling and spine development. Although the ""classic"" glucose transporters have been mapped (GLUT1-4), the newly discovered glucose transporters remain to be studied in the brain partly due to a lack of good antibodies suitable for immunohistochemistry. We will examine how brain activation produced by learning and memory processing can increase the number of these transporters in brain cells. Also, we will examine the role of glucose transporters in the reduction of glucose uptake in the brain during normal and pathological aging. This research program will address an important gap in our basic knowledge of brain metabolism that has been neglected in the past.

"Many organic molecules can exist in left or right-handed forms. While these molecules are identical in all respects except that they are mirror images of each other, they can have profoundly different physiological properties. The public became aware of the ""handedness"" in organic molecules in the 1960's when the drug thalidomide was given as a mixture of left and right-handed forms to pregnant women to combat morning sickness. Although the right-handed form of the drug was beneficial, the left-handed form caused severe birth defects in children, and thalidomide was quickly banned. Subsequently, extensive efforts were placed on synthesizing organic molecules selectively in purely left or right-handed forms by using ""handed"" catalysts; these efforts continue today. The proposed research outlines a new class of ""handed"" molecules which until recently could not be easily prepared, but for which there are exciting prospects for new catalyst development. It is anticipated that the new catalysts will offer opportunities to develop new chemical transformations with which to selectively make handed molecules, of which one of  the many potential benefits includes the preparation of safer drugs.","Advancement of knowledge","Brock University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Chimie organique","Chimie organique"

However, during the manufacture and use of nanomaterials (NMs), they will be released into the environment where they may produce adverse environmental impacts. While nanotechnology has the potential to produce many societal benefits, it should also be a priority to better understand the risks posed to aquatic organisms by NMs released into the environment.

In addition, the research team will evaluate current methods for assessing the ecological risks of NMs released into the aquatic environment and will make recommendations for appropriate methods for exposure and effects assessment. This research program will be conducted by a multidisciplinary group of academic researchers located at Trent University, the University of Ottawa and the University of Alberta.

"The proposed research program examines the developmental mechanisms which drive children's spoken word recognition toward a mature state. Spoken word recognition in the adult literature is presumed to be a discriminative process. The speech input activates all similarly sounding words in a listener's lexicon (a similarity neighborhood) and words compete for recognition. Words that reside in dense neighborhoods (i.e., have many similarly sounding neighbors) are recognized more slowly and less accurately than those residing in sparse neighborhoods. Lexical representations and lexical organization are based on segments or phonemes, and this does not vary with the size of a word's neighborhood or the position of information within a word. Less is known about the development of spoken word recognition in early through middle childhood. Children's lexicons are smaller than adults and more dynamic as vocabulary knowledge continues to grow substantially past the initial vocabulary growth spurt. The proposed program of research aims to explore the role of increased neighborhood density in driving segmental representation, processing, and organization in young children's spoken word recognition. The role of increasing neighborhood density is also examined in relation to the development of children's phonological awareness abilities, and a training experiment is included to test the causal nature of this relationship. The effects of density and phonotactic probabilities on young children's spoken word recognition and vocabulary acquisition are examined toward a better understanding of these influences and to test if each can be differentiated, as in the adult behavioral data. The proposed program of research also examines whether different measures purporting to evaluate the quality of phonological representations form a unitary construct that is stable over time and predictive of growth in phonological awareness and reading. The findings from the proposed studies have implications for better understanding language development and its role in reading acquisition and will be of interest to those in the fields of language development and impairments, reading acquisition, and reading disabilities.

"Damage to the adult brain usually has permanent behavioural and anatomical consequences. A major effect of brain damage is to cause loss of movement capacity. Most individuals, over time, develop compensatory movement strategies that substitute for lost motor capacity. Compensatory strategies are clearly recognizable and distinguishable from original movements. My work has shown that most recovery after brain injury represents compensation of the lost motor function rather than restoration of original movements. Therefore, I propose the brain optimization theory stating that the adult brain functions at the best possible level, and that any form of injury permanently disrupts its original function. Thus, lost function is replaced by alternative, compensatory movement strategies over time. My research is directed toward identifying compensatory strategies and associated plasticity by using skilled movement analysis. In the proposed research, I will use laboratory rats to (1) characterize compensatory strategies used to overcome primary motor disability after injury, (2) quantify compensatory adjustments made by distal and proximal body parts, (3) determine the neural basis of compensation of motor function. The model will then be used to describe (1) how compensatory strategies change with different kinds of injury, (2) how experience can facilitate compensation or genuine restoration, (3) how physiological influences affect compensation. I will also pursue comparative analysis of compensatory behaviour in rats and human subjects. The overall hypothesis of this research is that, unless the lost tissue is replaced, compensatory strategies mediate recovery of function. These studies will elucidate mechanisms of how the brain and behaviour change in response to injury. Because compensation may be mediated by the same neural mechanisms as those that contribute to behavioural development and healthy aging, an understanding of compensation can lead to insights into nervous system function more generally.

"Canada is experiencing significant changes in its population, which is aging very quickly. It is therefore essential to innovate in the area of healthcare to identify appropriate ways that technologies can be used to find ingenious solutions to the problems experienced by the elderly. The purpose of this research project is therefore to develop and adapt automatic video surveillance methods for elderly so that they can preserve their autonomy and enjoy more their daily lives. The research is divided into three different subprojects all requiring automatic video surveillance with single or many cameras. In the first subproject, we propose to detect accidental falls of elderly people, which are one of the greatest risk factor for seniors living alone. Our approach is based on a combination of human shape variation and 3D motion of the body in general and the head in particular. In the same context we intend to develop a method to measure the gait of the elderly in his/her apartment for assessing possible degradation or changes to prevent falls and/or diagnose other problems (reduced mobility, decreased balance, increased body stiffness, shorter step, slower pace, reduced motion of the limbs etc.). The method uses a simplified 3D articulated skeleton model to analyze the gait. The last study consists in a computer vision system for monitoring medication intake, another major source of problems for elderly persons. At the core of this system are face, hands and pills (bottles) localization and tracking followed by activity recognition with multi-level scenario models. We believe that such video systems will advantageously complement other types of sensors used for telemonitoring by overcoming many of their limitations.

"The clinical use of many potent drugs is often being compromised by their low water solubility. While it is reported that about 10% of the drugs currently under investigation present solubility-related bioavailability problems, 40% of the newly discovered drugs are expected to be poorly water-soluble. Increasing efforts are hence directed at developing simple yet universal technologies for the formulation of such water-insoluble drugs. It has been demonstrated that nanonization facilitates the injection of poorly-water soluble drugs and favourably increases their dissolution rate following oral administration. The proposed project will be aimed at investigating the use of the recently introduced method of femtosecond laser ablation in liquids to fabricate drug nanocrystals. The main advantage of the laser ablation-based approach compared to conventional nanofabrication methods is the facile and fast synthesis of nanoparticles in clean, contamination-free environment with minimal concentration of surface active agents. This enables to solve or significantly reduce toxicity-related problems and risks.The feasibility of the proposed approach will be investigated on several model hydrophobic drugs including paclitaxel (cytostatic agent), etoposide (cystotatic agent) and fenofibrate (lipid regulating agent). Preliminary tests conducted with paclitaxel revealed that drug nanocrystals (500 nm) could be produced with no signs of major chemical degradation. The successful fulfillment of this project may translate into improved drug therapies for a number of pathologies such as cancer and infectious diseases. The proposed approach may allow the rapid preclinical evaluation of candidate drugs that face solubility problems. A Canadian pharmaceutical company has already expressed interest in the technology.

"ULTRAFAST LASER INDUCED PROCESSES IN MATERIALS AND NANOMATERIALS

Ultrafast lasers, with femtosecond (fs) pulse widths, are becoming an exceptional tool to induce various types of processes in condensed matter leading to unique materials modifications, including phase and microstructural transformations, non thermal melting, vaporization and ablation. The main objective of this research is to develop an understanding of the basic mechanisms of ultrafast laser-materials interaction and explore new ultrafast laser processes in materials and nanomaterials for potential applications in nanotechnology, biomedicine, microelectronics and optoelectronics. With the objective to investigate the basic mechanisms of ultrafast laser ablation, we will pursue our modeling work using our unique Monte-Carlo/Molecular dynamics approach and investigate the effects of the pulse shape and the presence of defects in the solid on the ablation mechanism. Non-thermal phenomena, such as Coulomb explosion, will be modeled using our previously developed model based on Quantum Fluid Dynamics. Experimental studies on pulsed shape ultrafast laser-materials interaction and ablation of absorbing and transparent materials will be performed with the aim to deliver the energy to the materials in a very controlled way leading to an optimized materials transformation. In addition, we will pursue the development of ultrafast laser ablation of a target immersed into a liquid to produce various types of colloidal metallic nanoparticles, plasmonics nanostructures, nanocrystalline hydrophobic drugs and magnetic nanoparticles. Compared with all other conventional chemical techniques, our �green� laser method presents the advantage of producing contamination-free finely controlled nanomaterials in biocompatible liquids. Plasmonic enhanced ultrafast laser interactions with nanostructures will be investigated for biological photothermal applications. Over five years, ~ 20 Highly Qualify Personnels will be trained on research projects related to the fields of materials and laser physics, nanotechnology and biomedical which are highly relevant to many Canadian industries, research centers and universities.

"I am developing theory that addresses 3 fundamental aspects of human memory:

    WORD MEANING.  Over the grant period, Mike Jones and I have developed an algorithm (BEAGLE) that reads text sentence by sentence and uses circular convolution and noise-cancellation mechanisms to learn a distributed holographic representation of each word's meaning.  For each word, BEAGLE develops a vector that contains a history of the contexts in which the target word appeared (item information) and of its position within the contexts (order information).     

    HOW ONE THOUGHT LEADS TO ANOTHER.  By internal control, I refer to control based on the meaning of words.  It contrasts with control based on timing and like extra-semantic factors.  Using BEAGLE vectors, I propose a mechanism for internal control and discuss (a) how it can distinguish a river's bank from a financial institution and (b) how it can titrate item and order information.  To test the account, I propose to simulate how people organize words when asked to learn them, a phenomenon--Subjective Organization--first reported by Tulving in 1962.   

    HOW WE RECOGNIZE RECENTLY STUDIED MATERIAL.  Retrieval for recognition is based on a resonance-like mechanism rather than search using an addressing system.  In a yes/no recognition task, probes are rejected if they include features that contradict the studied material.  I describe experiments to test how people use contradictory information.  In addition, I propose experiments to sort true examples of recognition from cases in which people find the answer by exploiting the structure of the experiment.  

    APPLICATIONS.  Semantic applications of the theory include knowledge retrieval rather that key-word search, intelligent web search, and translation.  Non-semantic applications include measurement of structure in successive command-and-control decisions in military and like emergency situations.

"RNA molecules are at the core of numerous fundamental processes in any cell. They encode information on the set of proteins to be synthesized in a cell; they help synthesize proteins; they control protein-production rates (see Nobel Prize in Medicine 2006); and they also act as genes in their own right (so-called RNA genes). Many of these functions rely on the structure of the RNA molecule.



RNA molecules are linear chains of variable lengths made of four elementary building blocks, the nucleotides denoted A, C, G and U. An RNA structure is defined by weak hydrogen bonds between pairs of non-consecutive nucleotides in the RNA sequence; the three possible pairs are {A, U}, {G, C} and {G, U}. The number of possible RNA structures that an RNA sequence can assume grows exponentially with the length of the sequence. The challenge to the theoretical scientist is to single out the RNA structure that confers the functional property to the RNA molecule.



To address this challenge, most existing methods rely on the assumption that RNA molecules assume the most stable structure. Recent results show that this assumption does not hold in general. We propose to develop novel,significantly improved, theoretical methods which do not rely on this assumption and which overcome the major conceptual limitations of the existing methods in order to improve RNA structure prediction, RNA gene prediction and to address many of the most fundamental and exciting questions in molecular biology today.

"In biochemistry, biotechnology, medicinal chemistry, drug-design, polymer research, and nanotechnology, macromolecular computer modeling and design are becoming major tools. Most earlier macromolecular modeling techniques, however, are rather crude, such as the most popular fused-sphere models ignoring pi-bonding and finer details. 

    )	New level of accuracy has become possible for detailed macromolecular, protein and nanomaterial modeling, by the development and extensive tests of the  ab initio quality ADMA  (Adjustable Density Matrix Assembler)  macromolecular quantum chemistry method. This linear-scaling method is likely to provide a wealth of new knowledge about the very extensive low electron density interactions within globular macromolecules, e,g. proteins, influencing, even determining the folding pattern, so important in protein structure and reactions. Up till now, these extensive low density ranges have been ignored by conventional fused sphere models, and have been inaccessible for study by conventional quantum chemistry methods, prohibitively expensive and unsuitable for macromolecules. 

    )	The ADMA macromolecular quantum chemistry method, and shape analysis techniques will be applied to

(i)  the study and understanding of the stabilizing role of low density contributions to the electronic cloud of macromolecules, e.g. in protein folding and supramolecular chemistry, 

(ii)  designing novel macromolecules by assembling surroundings-adjusted functional groups into a desired structure, a task especially suited for the assembly-based ADMA method. 

(iii) Basic research on molecular informatics, holographic density theorem will continue. 

Significant advances are expected in understanding and designing biomolecules and nanostructures, and solving actual problems of Canadian biotechnology and toxicology, both in academia and industry.

"Environmental concerns as well as increased prices of fuels has brought energy efficiency to the forefront of

research priorities. Canada currently ranks as the world's sixth largest user of primary energy. A significant

portion of that energy is spent by comfort control structures that regulate temperatures and humidities in

buildings; a large percentage of such control structures are installed, operated and serviced by the industrial

partner for this project, Johnsons Control Inc (JCI). Development of a systematic framework that can yield the

most energy efficient comfort control, is therefore important, both economically, and environmentally

(corroborated, in part by the fact that JCI has an entire group, The Building Efficiency Research Group,

dedicated to exploring new ways of achieving energy efficiency). In implementing comfort control, the

limitations of heating and cooling equipment, the necessary start ups and shutdowns of equipment, as well as

the desire to hold conditions within comfortable regions naturally requires a control framework that can handle

constraints, nonlinearities, respond to uncertainties, and account for optimality, as well as the multivariable

nature of the process in a systematic manner. There is a significant `energy gap' that can be exploited by

utilizing advanced model predictive control methods. Motivated by these considerations, this project aims at

"Nitride compound semiconductors, including GaN, InN, AlN, and their alloys, have emerged as the materials of choice for solid state lighting, high power and high temperature electronic devices, photovoltaics, chip-level optical communications and bio-sensors. Recently, it has been proposed, and further demonstrated by the applicant and other researchers, that nearly defect-free nanoscale heterostructures, including quantum dots and nanowires, can be epitaxially grown on highly lattice mismatched Si substrates, thereby opening up the exciting possibility for realizing nitride-based nanoscale electronic, photonic, and biosensing devices on a Si platform. In this regard, a group of researchers at McGill University, consisting of experts in materials growth (Z. Mi), photovoltaics (I. Shih), optical communications (A. Kirk), genomics (R. Sladek), device design and theory (H. Guo), materials characterization and physics (G. Gervais and P. Gr�tter), and MEMs and CMOS electronics (V. Chodavarapu) have initiated a range of research projects centered on nitride-based nanoscale semiconductors, among which five projects are being funded by NSERC Strategic Project Grants Program. However, progress in our research has been severely limited by the lack of a suitable nitride epitaxial growth system. Mi has established a molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth infrastructure, which is perfectly suited for all of our research effort except that two critical components are missing: a high performance nitrogen plasma source and a Si effusion cell. The acquisition of these components can therefore significantly accelerate our research progress.

"There has been escalating interest, both in research and commercial fields, for the development of highly sensitive, selective, robust, and portable DNA sensors to attend the growing market of molecular diagnostics. In particular, there is an urgent need for clinical devices to genotype polymorphic DNA sequences, which, through interaction with various environment factors, are largely responsible for the development and progression of common diseases, including diabetes, heart diseases, cancer, depression and asthma. In this strategic project, we propose to develop, for the first time, a novel InN nanowire based nanotechnology platform for ultrasensitive, real time, label free, and multiplexed detection of DNA sequences, with a strong

focus on assays for DNA polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes. This novel nanobiosensor utilizes a

field-effect-based sensing mechanism, wherein the binding of biomolecules (typically charged) significantly alters the local charge distribution of the nanowire, thereby converting DNA hybridization into an electrical signal that can be further amplified, processed, and recorded. For the sensitive detection of DNA, the InN nanowire surface will be functionalized by peptide nucleic acid capture probes. The superior transport properties of InN, in conjunction with the unusual property of electron accumulation at the wire surface, promises a new generation of nanowire biosensors with a potential detection sensitivity of more than a factor of 100 times better than that of Si nanowire based devices. The applicants have already made significant progress in developing such novel nano devices as well as in mapping the genetic basis for type 2 diabetes. In this

strategic project, we will further develop InN nanowire sensor arrays for multiplexed analysis of polymorphic DNA sequences, with the potential of discriminating a single base pair mismatch.

"Concerns about the deteriorating global environment and depleting natural resources have prompted a new wave of technology development for green energy solutions. In this regard, clean and virtually unlimited solar energy have been intensively explored worldwide. To make such renewable energy the profitable kind of energy, it is crucial to develop novel solar cells with drastically reduced manufacturing cost and further improved efficiency. In this strategic project, we propose to develop, for the first time, low cost and high efficiency InGaN based tandem solar cells on Si that can potentially reduce the ultimate costs of solar cell modules by a factor of two or three. This is possible due to that the energy band-gap or absorption spectrum of InxGa1-xN alloy can be continuously varied from 0.7 to 3.4 eV, thereby providing an almost perfect match to

the solar spectrum. As a result, drastically improved efficiency is expected from InGaN solar cells, compared to any other devices. This unique feature is particularly important for tandem solar cells, as it enables, for the first time, direct integration of sub cells with similar material properties, leading to drastically reduced manufacturing costs and improved yield. Such solar cells can be grown directly on low cost, large area Si substrates, a technology that has already been demonstrated by the applicants. In this project, we also propose to develop integrated nanowire/bulk multi-junction solar cells on Si with further improved efficiency and reduced costs. Combining the applicants' long, outstanding expertise in the growth of nanoscale

semiconductors on Si and the development of solar cells, this project is well positioned to address some of the grand challenges in the design, growth and fabrication of novel InGaN tandem solar cells on Si. The project objective is to achieve an energy conversion efficiency of ~ 30%, or approximately twice of that of Si solar cells currently on the market, while maintaining the economic and environmental advantages of Si-based technology.

"It has been predicted that, by 2015, nanotechnology related products will contribute more than $1 trillion to the global economy. Accordingly, the release of nanotechnology wastes in the environment and their subsequent effects on mammalian and ecological systems have become a growing concern. A large part of nanotechnology wastes are in the form of nanoparticles, which can be easily distributed within human body and cross the cell membranes. Even materials that are considered safe in the bulk form, such as gold, can be highly toxic at the nanoscale. However, with sizes smaller than one hundredth of the diameter of a human hair, these ultra-fine particles cannot be seen or smelled. Nor can they be readily detected using conventional screening techniques. In this context, we propose to develop an integrated nanoparticle detection system, consisting of microtube optical ring resonators and a dynamic nanoparticle database, for real time and highly sensitive identification of nanoparticles related to nanotechnology wastes. We have recently developed novel microtube optical ring resonators, whose output characteristics are directly related to the presence of any nanoparticles on the surface. Therefore, important properties of nanoparticles, including size, composition, shape, and density can be derived in real time. The comprehensive database will include any known nanoparticles in nanotechnology wastes, their origin, properties, biological activity, and potential effects on mammalian and ecological systems. Moreover, we will demonstrate a pilot scale experiment system that can potentially be deployed in the field to better manage nanotechnology wastes. This project will contribute significantly to the monitoring, risk assessment, and management of a wide range of health and environmental issues of the existing and emerging nanotechnology wastes.

"The driving forces for future technologies have increasingly relied on the exploration of novel nanoscale materials. Antimony (Sb)-based self-organized semiconductor nanostructures, such as InAs(Sb)/InGaAsSb and InSb(As)/InAs quantum dots and nanowires, a class of novel materials with tremendous importance for infrared and terahertz photonics, have remained largely unexplored. In this program, the PI will investigate the growth and fundamental characteristics of such nanostructures and develop near-, mid-, and far-infrared nanophotonic devices, providing enabling solutions for critical technologies in communications, spectroscopic sensing, medical imaging and future quantum computing. In the short-term, the PI will develop 1.55 �m InAs(Sb)/InGaAsSb quantum dot lasers and amplifiers on GaAs that can significantly outperform their quantum well counterparts, for applications in fiber optical communications. In the medium-term, the PI will investigate the epitaxial growth and characterization of Sb-based mid-infrared quantum dot heterostructures and extend, for the first time, the demonstrated InAs quantum dot technology developed by the PI and other researchers, to the mid- and far-infrared frequency ranges. The third focus is the development of novel quantum dot and nanowire heterostructures with precisely controlled properties by utilizing the novel technique of selective area growth on nano-patterned substrates, with the long-term goal is to realize electrically-injected ultrahigh-speed nanoscale lasers and high-efficiency single photon sources, fundamental building blocks for future quantum computing and information processing systems. 



The proposed research program extends across several frontiers of science and engineering and will provide an exceptional opportunity for students to acquire knowledge and gain expertise in epitaxial growth, nanofabrication, and characterization of nanophotonic devices and, therefore, prepare them well for future careers in emerging areas of nanoscience and nanotechnology.

"My research proposal is focused on modeling the viscosities of bitumen and heavy oil mixed with diluents, and the effects of phase transformation (causing asphaltenes precipitation) during dilution on viscosity and subsequently on the accuracy of the viscosity models. Canada's in-place bitumen and heavy oil is estimated to be 3.2 trillion barrels of the world's 10 trillion barrels. The highly viscous nature of the bitumen and heavy oil means that their recovery has required sophisticated processes such as Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD), Steam and Gas Push (SAGP), Cyclic Steam Simulation (CSS), and Vapor Extraction (VAPEX) process where blending with refinery distillate fractions, reservoir oils or condensates are used to overcome itheir low mobility. Viscosity is an important parameter in the recovery and transportation of petroleum. The reduction of bitumen viscosity by solvent dilution is arguably the most common method in the enhanced oil recovery process; however, the undesirable phenomenon of asphaltene precipitation from bitumen and heavy oil and its deposition within reservoirs, storage vessels, pipelines and valves has the potential to halt production. The objectives of the study are to: (a) examine the solubility characteristics of several diluents for reducing the viscosity of bitumen/heavy oils for the purpose of enhanced oil recovery, (b) evaluate the stability of the oil-diluent mixtures against phase transformations as pure mixtures and with additives at different temperature and pressure conditions and how they affect viscosity and (c) use the data obtained from these evaluations to develop a generalized and accurate viscosity model for the oil-diluents system at different temperature and pressure ranges. Viscosity model is an important component of the packages used in these processes. The significance of my research is, therefore, to develop accurate viscosity models for incorporation in simulation packages for in-situ oil recovery, pipeline transportation and transport properties of the oil in reservoir conditions, reducing the costs of production and processing of bitumen in Canada.

"My research interest is in  harmonic analysis and Banach algebras using powerful   tools from operator algebras and group representations. The main objects of my study are the locally compact topological groups G, the Fourier and Fourier-Stieltjes algebras A(G) and B(G), the Figa-Talamanca-Herz algebra A_p(G) and the more general Banach algebra W_p(G), as well as some other Banach algebras associated to G. These mathematical objects are both algebraic and topological in nature, and are  widely studied by many mathematicians such as Antoine Derighetti, Brian Forrest, Ed. Granirer,  Anthony Lau, Alan Paterson,  Zhong-Jin Ruan and Joseph Rosenblatt. These objects are not only important in the area of theoretical   mathematics, but also very useful to physicists, statisticians and social scientists. Among some of the problems that I plan to work on are the following:

    

      (a) The Banach algebras A_p(G) and B_p(G) are studied extensively by many mathematicians such as Derighetti (Delaporte and Derighetti JLMS 1993), Forrest (TAMS 1994) and Granirer (Memoirs, AMS 1972). I will continue to investigate the approximation property of A_p(G) in its multiplier algebra MA_p(G). In particular, I will look at  the problem that if there is an example of a locally compact group G such that A_p(G) does not have the approximation property.

     (b) Lau and Wong (PAMS 1989) have proved that when G is amenable, A(G) ( same as A_2(G)) is Arens regular if and only if G is finite.  I will look at this result for non-amenable groups. I would like to establish the p-version of this result that A_p(G) is Arens regular if and only if G is finite. Ulger has  obtained some results in this  direction (Isik, Pym Ulger JLMS 1987 and Ulger-Lau TAMS 1996). I would like to pursue the study of the topological center of A_p(G).   



  (c) It is known from the theory of group representation that A(G) has an orthogonal complement B^s(G) in B(G). I have characterized both A(G) and B^s(G) by some elementary properties of functions on G (Miao, TAMS 1999). This result has been extended to A_p(G). I will study whether A_p(G) has an orthogonal complement in B_p(G). If it is true, then a lot of results on A(G) and B(G) can be generalized to A_p(G) and B_p(G).



   (d) Recently, Granirer has obtained some interesting results about A_p^r(G) ( Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 2006). I have investigated the approximation property of A_p^r(G) in its multiplier algebra. I will study some of the other properties of A_p^r(G) such as the geometric properties, the Arens regularity and the topological center of its double dual.

"A specific set of immediate-early genes (IEGs) are regulated by synaptic activity and play an important role in brain development giving rise to stable and functioning brain circuits. The IEG arc/arg3.1 has been shown to be involved in long-term changes and to directly modulate synaptic processes underlying memory and the encoding of novelty-related events. All stimuli involve a memory component in which each stimulus is compared to previously encoded stimuli for it to be considered novel or familiar.

The first study will examine the brain expression of synaptic arc/arg 3.1, compared to neuronal c-fos, activity-regulated IEGs either to novel auditory stimulation of normal (C57BL/6) and naturally blind (ZRDCT/An) mice or to novel visual stimulation (C57BL/6). These IEGs will also be investigated after repeated exposure to the same stimuli (familiarisation) as well as in animals raised in either enriched or standard environments. The blind ZRDCT/An mouse serves as an excellent model for cross-modal plasticity as auditory stimulation has been shown to produce neuronal activation of what is normally visual cortex, an effect that is enhanced by environmental enrichment (Pich� et al. 2004). The second part of the work will examine arc/arg3.1 and c-fos gene expression in the pigeon brain following exposure to novel visual stimuli or during either initial learning or recall phases of more complex visual-intensity discrimination tasks using touchscreen presented stimuli. The work will allow us to elucidate basic brain mechanisms involved in different levels of sensory processing (perceptual, encoding of novel stimuli, discrimination learning and memory). The studies will also allow us to better understand some cross-modal sensory phenomena observed in blind or deaf humans and have clinical or therapeutic implications with regard to the effect of sensory stimulation on cross-modal compensation.

"Early detection of cardiovascular diseases has long become a very active and important research area in medical imaging. In particular, there exists evidence that many critical cardiac disorders can be successfully determined through characterization of the regional cardiac function. For this reason, there has been ever increasing interest in cardiac elastography as a relatively new and very promising technique for analyzing and visualizing the local and global mechanical functions of the heart.

Unfortunately, the current progress of cardiac elastography seems to have been hampered by the absence of bona fide methods for estimating the local strains (and/or their rates) of the cardiac muscle. Among the main reasons for which the existing estimation methods fall short to provide reliable results are: 1) non-optimality of the tools used for enhancing the cardiac images and 2) non-optimality of the models used to describe the dynamics of a living heart.

The proposed research program is aimed at developing a qualitatively new system for cardiac elastography. The objectives of the program include:

1) Development of computationally efficient, robust and accurate preprocessing algorithms for enhancement of cardiac images;

2) Development of efficient and reliable methods for estimating the cardiac dynamics from the preprocessed sequences of cardiac images;

3) Establishment of the most relevant criteria for automatic discrimination between normal and abnormal regions of the cardiac muscle; 

4) Exploration of the role of cardiac elastography in the detection of ischemia and infarction via simulations, phantom-based experiments and in vivo study.

5) Development of a package of procedures for implementing the method on commercial scanners.

"The proposed research program has a number of facets centered on the study of biological materials using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Resilin is a rubber-like protein produced by insects.  Our laboratory, in collaboration with others at UBC and in Australia are working on understanding the microscopic basis for its mechanical properties.  Our Australian collaborators have produced a synthetic version of resilin on which we are performing NMR experiments that probe the molecular structure and dynamics.  We plan to more thoroughly study both the synthetic protein as well as a naturally occurring resilin from dragonflies.

     Marine snails (whelks) protect their eggs in capsules made from a very tough protein based material. This material has been found to have unusual bimodal mechanical properties. We plan to use solid-state NMR to study the microscopic basis of these unusual properties.  

      A relatively new technique known as electrospinning has been used to produce fibres made of a genetically engineered version of spider silk.  Previous studies of electrospun silk proteins have shown relatively poor properties compared to native silk fibers, but that the properties can be improved by the addition of carbon nanotubes. We plan to use solid-state NMR to study electrospun fibers made from silk proteins blended with carbon nanotubes and other polymers. These fibers, if the properties can be further improved, may be very useful for making high strength, light-weight fibres and fabrics with a potential for a large number of applications demanding high breaking strength materials.

     In addition to these projects, my laboratory has had an ongoing effort in technique development in NMR. We have developed a new excitation mechanism for NMR that creates NMR signals without using any near-resonance radio-frequency pulses. Currently we are working on two-photon chirp-pulse excitation, where a swept frequency source is used to excite full-amplitude NMR signals over a broad bandwidth.  We plan to fully explore the applications of two-photon NMR.

"In clinical decision-making there are many situations where a final outcome is a result of multiple intertwined tasks. Managing a patient in the Emergency Department (ED) comes to mind. In order to facilitate patient management and to follow evidence-based medicine, hospitals introduce clinical pathways as tools to ensure that patients receive the most appropriate care. These pathways are developed from clinical practice guidelines and they outline a sequence of temporal clinical evaluations and interventions. In that sense a pathway is a prescriptive model of a decision-making process with individual tasks corresponding to different, time-dependent activities. While there are clinical DSS created to support one activity at a time, there is no design methodology that provides comprehensive support for a set of activities. The purpose of the research described in this proposal is to develop a methodology for designing a meta-DSS that brings together different support requirements and capabilities so that entire decision-making process is supported. We will create a meta-DSS design using the Organizational-based Multiagent System Engineering (O-MaSE) methodology that allows for modeling changes to the problem structure as a result of interactions between agents (common situation for patient management where treatment changes depending on latest assessment and previous actions). We will be looking at individual tasks comprising a pathway as independent agents (entities), each with its own requirements and capabilities. We will model these agents, as ""services"" that should be brought together in order to accomplish a common goal. We will use the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) paradigm for connecting on demand loosely coupled tasks from a clinical pathway as well as support capabilities provided by stand-alone clinical DSS. The implementation of the SOA will involve identification and description of tasks (service requestors) that invoke individual support requirements associated with some specific clinical DSS (service providers). We are planning to evaluate the capabilities of a meta-DSS design using clinical pathways for ED management of pediatric head trauma and asthma.

"Several proteins of medical interest have been produced successfully in � plant protein biofactories � over the last ten years, including a variety of vaccines, diagnostic antibodies, protein allergens and peptidic hormones. The main goal of this project is to develop a plant expression system for the production of medically-useful proteins susceptible to degradation in foreign environments. The general idea is to provide Canadian biotech companies with molecular tools useful in making plant  factories a milder environment for fragile proteins. Protein-stabilizing proteins called protease inhibitors will first be designed by current genetic and protein engineering approaches, and then used as 'companion molecules' to protect the proteins of interest in the host plant tissues. This new concept for recombinant protein protection will be tested with several proteins of

"In designing advanced robotic systems, the main challenge is to integrate in a working system all the necessary elements (from mechatronics to sensing, computing, deciding and interacting modalities) required on a mobile robot to fulfill a useful role in real-life settings. Such a design requires a broad set of underlying expertises, usually addressed separately in distinct research laboratories. A unique collaboration opportunity between the Univ. Sherbrooke and Indiana Univ. Bloomington, Arizona State Univ. and Stanford Univ. will make it possible to integrate contributions on robust natural language interaction, affective computing, goal languages, logic and planning and cognitive architecture into an advanced omnidirectional humanoid robotic platform made by the Canadian group. This platform will be capable of changing its height, do gestures and facial expressions, feel the ground through its locomotion components and interact with people and the world with two arms and grippers through force sensing using a new type of actuators. It will use a sound source localization, tracking and separation system as pre-processing for speech recognition and dialogue manage- ment, goal generation and affective evaluation from linguistic and non-linguistic cues. It will also be capable to plan what it must do in highly dynamic and changing conditions of the real world. Computational architectures coming from engineering and cognitive modeling perspectives will be validated using this experimental testbed in realistic operating conditions. The integrated result will be demonstrated at the International RoboCup@Home competition, focusing on real-world applications and human-machine interaction with autonomous robots assisting humans in everyday life. Three Canadian researchers will be funded in this project, training 3 Ph.D., 1 Master's, 3 undergraduate trainee and 1 research professional. This project will produce one of the most advanced autonomous and interactive mobile robot ever built, with groundbreaking results on human-robot interaction and intelligent architectures, making Canada take on a leadership role in new emerging fields of robotics with potential uses in robotic assistive and interactive technologies.

"Sea-ice harbors various ecological roles, which range from its influence on the Earth's climate and the freshwater balance of the Arctic Ocean, to its significance for the marine food chain. Seasonal sea-ice constitute about 50% of the total ice surface in the Arctic Ocean. During the past two decades, rapid warming of the Arctic and an associated decrease in ice cover have been observed. Current models suggest that this trend will continue. Sea-ice supports a diverse community of organisms, from viruses and bacteria, flagellates, ciliates, crustaceans, and other meiofauna. Primary production in the sea-ice is usually dominated by diatoms, which can reach very high biomasses in the spring.  Diatoms are also responsible for intense phytoplankton blooms taking place in open waters during the summer. Diatoms are main producers of exopolymeric substances (EPS), gel-like substances that can contribute a large fraction of the organic carbon in the sea-ice in the spring. Because EPS are sticky gels, they can favor aggregation and rapid sinking of algal biomass at the termination of blooms. Very little is known on the role of EPS, and the factors that regulate their production, in the Arctic. This research will investigate the dynamics of EPS in seasonal sea-ice and in the water column at the end of diatom blooms in seasonally ice-covered Arctic seas. The general objectives of this study are: 1) to evaluate the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on EPS concentrations and production in the sea-ice and open water in seasonally ice-covered Arctic seas, and 2) to assess the role of EPS in the cycling and sinking of algal blooms under contrasting biochemical environments in the Arctic. This research will contribute to our understanding of the carbon cycle in the Arctic and will provide key knowledge for predictive models in view of on-going changes taking place in the Arctic.

"When nerves drive their muscle partners and make them work in a way that would prompt them to grow and become more energy efficient, calcium waves or oscillations are triggered in muscle cells that serve as a sort of molecular code. Calcineurin is an enzyme found in muscle cells that acts as a sensor for detection of these calcium waves or changing levels. We were the first to demonstrate novel features of this exciting molecule and its key role at the nexus of signaling pathways leading to skeletal muscle adaptations and growth. Calcineurin and its molecular partners are brought into play to decipher the calcium code and enact mechanisms that will eventually lead to the activation of genes necessary for muscle growth and muscle efficiency.  As such, we liken the signals responsible for muscle growth to a perfect symphony with calcineurin acting as first violinist, taking the lead, but playing in concert with all other instruments in the orchestra. 



We have also been busy identifying other musicians in this growth opus and elucidating their possible interactions with calcineurin, with the hope that our research into nerve and muscle signaling may lead to new therapeutic strategies to counter neuromuscular disease. For instance, we have provided mounting evidence that molecular signals from the muscle's nerve somewhat independent of electrical nerve impulses, coined ""trophic"" (or Greek for ""feeding"") chemicals, are also involved in the scoring of musical themes for these orchestral manoeuvres, and in the process influencing proteins that lead to muscle fibre growth. Increased understanding of these and other mediators of growth may change our outlook on preventative and remedial exercise.

"Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are a suite of emerging technologies that will be used to make operation of land vehicles in urban centres or along transportation corridors safer and more efficient. Because much of the information that will be delivered and exchanged in ITS applications is time-sensitive and location-dependent, short-range vehicular networks that consist of wireless links between a vehicle and either roadside units or other vehicles in the immediate vicinity and that operate between 4.9 and 5.9 GHz have attracted particular interest in recent years. Anticipated applications of such networks include: (1) enhancing traffic safety by providing warnings and alerts in real time, (2) easing traffic congestion by adaptively changing traffic rules, (3) providing location-dependent information to drivers, (4) aiding traffic regulation enforcement, (5) enabling electronic payments and toll collection, (6) assisting in direction and route optimization, (7) providing information concerning services for travelers and (8) enabling automated highways.  Because vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside links involve both terminals and obstructions that are in motion, they experience relatively severe fading that is both time and frequency selective. In order to analyze, design and simulate short-range vehicular networks, designers and developers require channel models that capture the propagation impairments that degrade wireless signals in such environments. During the course of this project, we will contribute to the worldwide effort to measure and model short-range wireless channels in vehicular environments by: (1) developing usage models that describe both typical and extreme operating scenarios in such environments, (2) developing channel measurement equipment, also known as channel sounders, that are capable of characterizing time and frequency selective channels of the type encountered in such environments, and (3) capturing the results in the form of channel models useful to designers and developers.

"Richardson's ground squirrels are medium-sized rodents native to the short and mixed-grass prairies of Canada and adjacent US states.  They are an ideal species for behavioural and ecological studies because of their visibility (250-550 g as adults, diurnally active, resident in open habitat), ready habituation to human presence, and predictable annual cycle of events (emergence from hibernation, mating, pregnancy and lactation, pre-hibernation fattening, hibernation).  None-the-less, the species is rarely studied and, despite their common characterization as a major agricultural pest, remarkably little is known about mating behaviour, social relationships, and natural causes of mortality.

My long-term study of social, spatial, and seasonal behaviour addresses questions such as:  how many males a female mates with during her 2-hour annual estrus and which of those several mates is most likely to sire the offspring;  what reproductive factors (such as litter size, proportion of daughters in a litter) result in some matriarchs leaving many descendants and others none;  the extent to which females amicably share foraging space aboveground and sleeping/hibernation space underground;  whether climate change is extending the active season and shortening the hibernation season such that animals spend more of their life foraging aboveground;  what impact terrestrial predators (e.g. badgers), aerial predators (e.g. Swainson's hawks), and weather (e.g. flooding) have on population growth and decline.

"Nearly one-quarter of adults in Canada are considered to be extremely overweight, and the steady increase in obesity among Canadian children means that this number will continue to grow. While obesity can lead to a wide range of health problems, one of the most common, and most serious, is type 2 diabetes (T2D). As the number of people with T2D increases, there will be a matching rise in the number of women with diabetes during their pregnancies. Recent work over the last ten years has found that maternal nutrition can have longlasting effects upon the health of children; for example, maternal undernutrition can lead to an increased risk of heart disease in offspring when they become adults. The proposed study would like to examine how diabetes in pregnancy affects offspring development. In particular, the proposal will focus on development of a brain region known to be important for creating memories - the hippocampus. Female rats will be placed on a diet that, like the diets of many people, is very high in fat. Over time, the animals will develop T2D. After this, they will be mated and allowed to deliver and nurse their pups. Using a variety of techniques, structure and function of the hippocampus in offspring of diabetic rats at different ages will be compared to those from rats fed a control diet. All of the work together will help to answer the question: if a woman has diabetes during her pegnancy, will the areas of her child's brain important for learning and memory be affected? The outcome of the proposed study will not only be of interest to biologists, but should also be important to those involved with public health and policy.

"The main objective of this proposal is to develop a new concept of low cost high performance

nanocomposite-based photovoltaic cell. To achieve this goal, new polymer nanocomposites made of new

polymeric matrices filled with nanoparticles and quantum dots will be examined. The ultimate goal being to

control the dispersion-distribution of these nanoparticles and quantum dots into the polymer matrix to

maximize photon capture as well as charge transfer toward electrodes. Such material will have widespread

application for energy production if high enough conversion efficiency is achieved.

The project will be divided in three research aspects. The first part will be centered on developing the polymer

matrix, while the second will be focused essentially on the preparation of nanomaterials used as charge transfer

materials. The third part of the project is related to the integration of the components to obtain the most

"During the last few decades, a tremendous effort was undertaken to improve and commercialize the fuel cell technology especially that of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, PEMFCs, because of their high energy conversion efficiency at low temperature and their zero emission features. However, one of the key requirements in making PEMFCs commercially viable as automotive power systems is to reduce their cost (1). 



The main objective of this proposal is to develop, via industrially viable processing techniques (mainly based on extrusion, calendaring, and thermoforming processes) new polymer-based materials for PEMFC bipolar plates, electrodes and membrane electrode assemblies. The proposal comprises three research aspects: 

i)    )	The first research theme will be centered on the development/characterization of polymer blend-based materials for bipolar plates. The concept of co-continuous polymer blends filled with a mixed conductive filler system consisting of carbon nanotubes and carbon black will be investigated. 

ii)    )	The second part of the project will be focused on the development/characterization of structured materials for porous electrodes composed of two layers having a binary mixture of pores. The aimed objective is to develop electrodes of low through-plane resistivity by using a combination of carbon nanotubes and carbon black. 

iii)    )	Once electrode structure is optimized, we propose to investigate different membrane electrode assemblies made up from the developed electrodes and new proton exchange membranes recently developed at Laval University. The high performances of these membranes, in particular their proton conductivities, often higher than Nafion, make them good PEM candidates.

"This research program is focused on the development and application of computer vision and decision-theoretic algorithms in the domain of healthcare technologies-- specifically, intelligent homes to support older adults.  Older adults constitute the fastest growing population group in Canada. Providing support to older adults who want to continue to live independently in their own homes is a growing social concern, especially for those who live alone.   Support and assistance is typically required in the forms of task guidance, such as providing reminders on how to complete a particular task, ensuring safety, such as responding to falls and accidents, and health assessment, in particular overall tracking of the person's levels of health and wellness, including level of mobility.  To date, we have developed individual systems that can perform these various functions, and have collected data to support their efficacy.  However, we have also identified key limitations that need to be addressed, through a more thorough exploration of the required system algorithms and techniques.  Our objectives over the next five years is to continue with the development of the health monitoring and emergency response system started during my first Discovery Grant, focusing on improving the system and overcoming the limitations of existing technologies.  My scientific goal is to continue to demonstrate the useful application of computer vision, planning algorithms, and other areas of AI (e.g., speech recognition) within this specific domain.  Furthermore, we will aim to develop an integrated system incorporating the functions required to support an older adult in the home. This research program is in one of the first attempts to apply sophisticated computer science concepts in this domain.  With a better understanding of the techniques that are most effective in these types of systems, older adults may benefit by being given the option to remain in their own homes longer, and help to reduce caregiver burden and stress.  The scientific importance of this approach is the development of computer vision, decision-theoretic techniques, and speech recognition, in a unique and highly relevant real-world application.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","University of Toronto",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Intelligence artificielle (vision artificielle, utiliser 2603)","Intelligence artificielle"

"The proposed program of research involves a new electrochemical method for the detection of biomolecules in solution (in bioassays) and bound to electrode surfaces (in biosensors).  Biomolecules including enzymes and antibodies will be investigated using biamperometry at interdigitated microband electrodes.  The new method of detection will be much more sensitive than existing methods because of the inherent simplicity of the measurement electronics and because of the cyclic amplification of currents that occurs at closely-spaced interdigitated electrodes. In the first of three proposed projects, a fundamental investigation of biamperometry is proposed, and the performance of the biamperometric method will be optimized for single-molecule detection of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase.  In the second project, applications will be explored to important enzymes including glucuronidase and galactosidase; these enzymes are important in molecular biology and highly sensitive assays for their activities will be useful in this field.  In the third project, biomolecules will be bound to the surfaces of interdigitated electrodes for the preparation of highly sensitive biamperometric biosensors.  During the course of this research, graduate and undergraduate students will gain expertise in various instrumental methods of importance to quantitative biochemical measurements.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","University of Waterloo",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Chimie bioanalytique","Chimie analytique"

"Software development is a very complex process that requires vast amounts of knowledge and skills both in software development itself and in the application domain, and researchers have long been trying to manage the complexity of the process. One of the earlier strategies - recently rehabilitated by OMG's Model-Driven Architecture- viewed the development process as a possibly long sequence of labour intensive, but automatable transformations that start with a specification of the software to produce a working version. The long-term goal of this research program is to develop a better understanding of the software development process within the framework of a transformational, model-driven approach. More specifically, we are interested in exploring two transformations that embody a non-trivial shift in focus: 1) the transition from process models to information system models, and 2) the transition from analysis to design. By automating the transition from process models to analysis models, we improve communication between the business users of software, and its developers, and we ensure that developers develop what the business users need. By automating the transition from analysis to design, we relieve designers and developers from the tedious and error-prone tasks involved in designs, and let them focus on the creative and intellectually challenging tasks where they add the most value. By automating both transitions, we empower business users to develop their own applications by specifying or ""drawing"" the business process they wish to support with the information system.","Information systems and technology","Universit� du Qu�bec � Montr�al",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Logiciels et d�veloppement","Technologie de l'information"

"This joint UBC-McMaster project brings together a group of Canada's leading Computational Materials Scientists with the goal of developing new process models based on computer modelling techniques spanning the atomistic to the macroscopic materials length-scales. Specifically, this project deals with the austenite-to-ferrite transformation in steels. This transformation constitutes the primary metallurgical tool used to generate the complex microstructures giving the superior properties of advanced high-strength steels. These new steels are primarily of significance for automotive applications where they enable the design of light-weight and, therefore, more fuel efficient vehicles. Similar developments in developing new steel grades are seen for pipelines and in the construction sector. These new steels require an increased level of alloying addition (e.g. Mn, Cr) to tailor the phase transformation and, as a value-added product, they require a significantly increased control of processing windows (e.g. in a hot mill) as compared to conventional steels. Thus, process models are critical to reduce property variability and to increase productivity that Canada's steel producers and users remain globally competitive. A particular challenge in developing a reliable process model for these new steels is that the effect of alloying elements on the austenite-to-ferrite transformation is poorly understood from a fundamental perspective. Thus, the proposed modelling approach employs an innovative methodology by modelling across different length scales. Process models are formulated on a macroscopic length scale while underlying physical parameters result from phenomena on the atomistic scale. Thus, modelling tools will be combined that cover different length scales, i.e. starting from ab-initio atomistic modelling of the interaction of alloying elements with the moving transformation front the modelling length scale will be gradually increased via the scale of the microstructure (i.e. so-called meso-scale) to the macro-scale of the industrial product. An integral part of the proposed approach is to validate the models with experimental and industrial data.","Materials sciences","University of British Columbia",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Science et technologie des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"
"Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector is one of the major tasks for Canada to

enable sustainable economic growth while addressing environmental concerns. A critical contribution to

achieve this goal is to use new materials with improved properties for the design of advanced vehicles with

increased fuel efficiency. Steelmakers have responded to this challenge by developing advanced high strength

steels with improved property profiles in terms of strength, formability and crashworthiness. These steels are

extremely competitive when compared to light metal alternatives. Currently, dual-phase steels with a

ferrite-martensite microstructure show an enormous potential for use by the automotive industry. The majority

of the dual-phase steel sheets will be produced by an intercritical annealing route on hot dip galvanizing lines.

This processing route constitutes a paradigm shift as compared to making conventional steel sheet. The

processing windows require a much tighter control for dual-phase steel such that it is crucial to develop

knowledge based modelling tools to design robust processing paths. The current proposal is designed to

provide critical knowledge to develop these tools. In particular, the effect of the as-hot rolled microstructure on

the intercritical annealing response will be quantified and models will be developed for the austenite formation

during intercritical annealing.","Materials sciences","University of British Columbia",2,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Transformation des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"

"In heterogeneous (hardrock) environments such as the Canadian Shield, a number of parameters related to scale and composition need to be considered that render seismic studies more problematic.  To model the propagation of seismic waves in these areas requires knowledge of petrophysical parameters (compressional and shear wave velocities and densities) and their distribution within the crust, which can be derived directly from borehole logs (in 1-D) or indirectly from geological maps and lithological analysis. We will collect velocity and density logs from various sources and analyze them for their first and  second order statistics. These not only give us the 1-D parameters in the vertical dimension but by correlating several boreholes will provide the means of constructing a 3-D model of crustal heterogeneity. Added to the background model will be massive sulfide deposits, which are known to scatter seismic energy according to their shape, size and composition. 3D elastic/visco-elastic forward modeling studies will be used to optimize 3D surface and borehole seismic data acquisition strategies.  In addition, heterogeneities may cause attenuation.  As waves travel in heterogeneous media, they lose energy with distance and time due to spherical divergence and absorption. It is commonly accepted that a flat absorption band exists for the solid earth. The effects of absorption and dispersion have been observed in exploration seismology at various frequencies (i.e. surface (Hz), borehole (KHz), and laboratory seismics (MHz)) for some time. We will use uncorrelated (raw) Vibroseis data to measure velocity dispersion and attenuation in the exploration seismic frequency band.  Ongoing research projects will focus on unique pressure-temperature conditions (and mineral deposits) related to meteorite impacts (Bosumtwi, Ghana; Chicxulub, Mexico; Sudbury, Ontario; Wanapitei, Ontario; the physical properties of permafrost and gas hydrates (Mallik, NWT) and 3D seismic research projects for deep mineral exploration (Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick).

The objectives of this research are to better understand, describe and quantify the development of bedforms and hydraulic roughness under intense, non-equlibrium sediment loading.  This is a topic that has received little research attention, and has immediate practical application to the lower Fraser River design flood profile.  It is anticipated that this research will yield quantitative relations that can be used to estimate bedform type and roughness under design flow conditions on the Fraser River, which will result in improved confidence in the computed flood levels.

"In systems control, the objective is to make a physical system (the plant) act in a desired manner through the use of an (automatic) controller, e.g. an autopilot (the controller) is used on an aircraft (the plant) to maintain speed, altitude and direction. The first step in control system design is to obtain a mathematical model of the plant, and then one designs a controller, described by a mathematical equation, which is typically implemented in software. This process is often difficult due to uncertainty in the plant model.



Most controllers presently implemented are described by linear equations with fixed parameters, such as the well-known proportional-integral-differential (PID) compensator. As microprocessors become faster, it is becoming possible to implement (possibly complicated) nonlinear and/or time-varying controllers. The objective here is to develop advanced linear periodic controllers which provide enhanced tolerance to plant model uncertainty as well as good performance. We are considering three different contexts:



(i) adaptive control, in which the plant parameters are unknown and possibly rapidly time-varying,



(ii) robust control, in which the plant is poorly known, but the parameters are fixed, and



(iii) control with delay, in which the plant model is well known but there is an uncertain delay in the feedback loop, such as when carrying out control over the Internet.



This work has potential long-term benefits wherever control is used, from robotics to aerospace to industrial automation, and my former graduate students work in all of these areas.

"The brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier have an important role in providing the proper environment for maintaining normal brain function.  Under normal conditions, the blood-brain barrier restricts the movement of solutes, macromolecules and cells from the blood to the brain.  While once considered to be a static cellular barrier, it is now understood that the permeability of the brain capillary endothelial cells  forming the blood-brain barrier can be altered in response to physiological and pathophysiological factors as well as drug therapy.  The ability to quantitatively monitor changes in blood-brain barrier function is crucial in understanding both disease progression as well as advancing treatment strategies for a number of neurological conditions.  The objective of the current proposal is to use a series of near infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dyes to assess selected blood-brain barrier function at both the cellular and whole animal level.  The advantage of the NIRF dye approach is the low background fluorescence and deep penetration of the fluorescence signal in the NIR wavelengths.  The proposal will focus on several specific transport/permeability pathways, including transcellular solute and macromolecule transport into and out of the brain, as well as cell junction integrity and immune cell migration and traficking in the blood-brain barrier. The long term objective of this research is the development of a NIRF imaging platform that can be used to monitor important blood-brain barrier function and quantitatively assess the impact of physiological and pathophysiological events that lead to alterations in normal blood-brain barrier function and ultimately alterations in neurological activity.

"Microsimulation involves the dynamic modelling of travel behaviour at the level of individual agents.  Microsimulation methods provide an ideal framework to exploit the strong explanatory power of disaggregate behavioural models and provide enhanced policy sensitivity.  Activity-based travel demand modelling recognizes that it is the need to participate in activities which drives the demand for travel.  Considerable progress has been made at the University of Toronto over the past several years towards the development of an operational activity-based microsimulation model of household travel behaviour (TASHA - Travel/Activity Scheduler for Household Agents).  The proposed project is designed to build upon and extend this work.  Specific objectives of the project are:

1. To extend the conceptual framework for the integrated modelling of short and long-term household-based decision-making that has been developed and partially implemented in TASHA.

2. To improve the representation of dynamic activity and travel supply constraints in agent-based models.

3. To implement improved, policy-sensitive models of activity generation within TASHA, building upon and extending recent work in this area.

4. To improve our models of non-work/school location choice.

5. To continue the development of an integrated activity-travel-emissions-dispersion-exposure model system for investigating the impact of transportation-generated air pollution on urban population health. 

Individually and collectively these tasks will extend the theoretical foundations of activity-based travel models, advance the state-of-the-art with respect to these models, and significantly improve our capability for supporting urban transportation policy analysis and the development of more sustainable urban transportation systems.","Transportation systems and services","University of Toronto",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie du transport","G�nie civil"

"Alignment is the act of adjusting or aligning the parts of a device in relation to each other.  Information alignment is the process of finding, modeling, and using the correspondences or connections that place information artifacts in relation to each other.  Alignment forms the basis of many information integration, sharing, and management tasks ranging from data integration and exchange to data cleaning and duplicate detection.  In many cases, there is no single optimal alignment, the best alignment is task and context-specific.   Hence, rather than full reconciliation or integration of information, we need to manage partially or incompletely aligned information. Current solutions for large-scale data management largely ignore the 

reality that real data is rarely completely and accurately aligned. 

 

My work to date has mainly considered the use of conceptual modeling techniques and logical inference to infer, use, manage, and maintain declarative schema mappings, the most commonly used form of schema alignment.  These techniques have been very successful in aligning logical schemas including relational, nested-relational, and XML schemas and are now the industry standard.  In the proposed work, I will extend this foundation to consider other alignment tasks for both data (entities) and other metadata including ontologies.  My goal is to understand how the inference techniques used for each type of data or metadata can be combined to provide fundamentally new and better discovery techniques.  In addition, I will study how inferred alignments can best be used and maintained within the context of large-scale data management solutions.

"Metallic alloys are useful for engineering applications largely due to their high strength.  Recently, materials scientists have discovered that this strength is further enhanced by so-called ""nano-structured materials"".  These are often the same alloys as conventional metals, but with special microstructural features refined to the nanometer-scale.  One finds, however, that the primary mechanisms governing strength and ductility are different in nano-structured materials than in conventional ones.  This new physics is not well understood, but occurs on length scales accessible to both modern atomistic simulation and nano-experiments.  It is a unique regime where a direct link between simulation and experimentation is possible.  

     Strength is of fundamental importance in almost every application.  Making a material stronger means we can make structures lighter, more energy efficient, safer, or faster.  Applications range from sporting goods to fuel-efficient cars to aircraft.  Even in non-structural applications like micro-electronics, improved strength can improve the robustness of the circuitry or permit further reductions in chip sizes.

     The proposed work will make use of advanced computer modeling techniques, where recent progress makes possible a ""virtual materials laboratory"".  With these tools, detailed ""virtual experiments"" can be performed to test materials, permitting a level of control and detail that is often impossible to achieve in a real experiment.  We can also study model materials that may not actually exist, but provide a direct test of hypotheses regarding important features or mechanisms in real materials.  

     The goal of this modeling is to unravel the details of the mechanisms of strength and ductility, and specifically to determine the key differences in behaviour between conventional materials and nano-structured materials.  Ultimately, the research will help guide the design of materials with improved mechanical properties.

"At any given moment, many different sources of information compete for our attention.  Some of these competing sources of information are external to us, such as highway traffic signs and oncoming traffic, while other competing sources of information can be thought of as internal, such as thoughts about our work duties and thoughts about a leisure activity that will follow work.  Given the volume of potential information available to the human mind, it is a wonder that we aren't paralyzed by information overload.  The study of attention aims to identify basic mental processes that allow us to process information selectively, and therefore avoid information overload.  Of course, human behaviour is often goal-driven, and thus this selection process is not haphazard.  Instead, if your goal is to search for a friend wearing a blue sweater in a crowd, your attention might be controlled in a way that leads people wearing blue to move into the foreground of the mind's eye.  The goal of this research program is to identify processes that govern this type of control over our attention.  A more specific aim of the research is to address an interesting dilemma about the control of attention.  In particular, although we may like to think that we control our attention with the effort of our will, much of our attentional behaviour seems relatively effortless.  This observation raises the possibility that the control of attention may be very much like other learned processes that become increasingly automatic with practice.  If this is the case, then we ought to be able to demonstrate rapid (automatic) implementation of attention control processes precisely in those situations in which an observer has implemented those same processes in the past.  If we are able to demonstrate such a result, then a host of interesting further questions require answers.  In particular, what brain systems are responsible for this type of control of attention?  And if effortful attention control is only required when we encounter new situations, what system is responsible for discriminating new from old situations so quickly that it can control what we ultimately attend to?  In other words, what system controls the control of attention?

"In recent years, there has been tremendous interest within the medical and biological research communities as their research into the development of transgenic organisms, drug testing on small groups of cells or single cells, and other activities related to genetics has developed.  It has become evident that such tasks, such as injection of material into cells for example, must be carried out on a large scale to keep pace with the needs of the medical and biological research communities.  Currently, much of this processing is carried out using manual operations.  To address this concern, the research work proposed here is directed towards the automation of micro-scale tasks using robotic technology. This researcher has a lengthy history in research in robotics in key areas of relevance to micro-scale task execution. These areas include robotic force control, contact task execution, design of closed-loop controllers for robots with prescribed closed-loop performance, investigation of stability and performance of robotic contact task controls.  We will investigate key research areas which now stand in the way of the automation of micro-scale tasks involving contact with biological materials. Interaction of robotic devices with micro-biological specimens easily results in failure if the biological material is disrupted due to poor control of the devices contacting cells. We will design controllers which can reliably control forces at the micro-Newton level, allowing reliable and consistent insertion of material into cells. Vision control coupled with inner-loop force and position controls will be designed and tested which can be used to automate the process. Utilizing robust control design methodologies, controllers will be designed to allow these robotic operations to be conducted in the presence of substantial dynamic parameter uncertainty in the biological material mechanical properties, while achieving good closed-loop performance. Further, methods will be developed to automatically position biological materials for automatic robotic processing. Extensive experimental investigations will test and verify the dynamic behaviour of these methodologies.

"Singularities express irregularities of form in many branches of mathematics in a way similar to what a singularity means in an everyday language. They are a basic object of study in most of the mathematics and its applications. Important features of form are often concentrated at singularities. The objective of my research is to find closer links between the geometry and analysis of singularities. A longer term objective would be a 'geometric desingularization', i.e. reconstruction of the entire process in terms of geometry and/or analysis.



In the past few years this research led me to a discovery of fundamental links between algebraic, analytic and geometric aspects of singularities: solutions of long-standing problems posed by Whitney, Thom and Hironaka; an extension to singular setting of classical Bernstein-Markov and Sobolev-Nirenberg type inequalities of analysis (by an introduction of a new geometric parameter that reflects the 'strength' of singularity and measures the deviation of these inequalities from their classical form); constructed a Poincare type metric off the singularities and established via desingularizing weights sharp new type bounds on the heat kernel. 



Currently I am working on 'strongly canonical' Thom stratifications in order to establish lower complexity bounds, on an extension of a Poincare inequality to some measure-metric spaces and on an extension of my results on Sobolev-Nirenberg type inequalities from singular domains to varieties. I intend to apply my recent work for toric varieties to derive for them a 'resolution of singularities of the induced metric' and work on a plausible conjecture in the 'general case'. I am also working on a solution of Whitney's extension problem via 'finite differences in several variables' as extremal points of a unit ball in an appropriate space. Finally, I  work on a 'calculation' of an ideal whose blowing up is a 'geometric minimal model' via a variant of an extremal problem of complex analysis and thus hope to reach my objective of a 'geometric desingularization'.

"The primary objective of this research proposal is to advance the knowledge and application of optimization-based control for constrained systems with fast dynamics, such as those prevalent in the automotive, robotics and aerospace fields.  Although many fast computational schemes and optimization algorithms exist for the unconstrained system, difficulties are often encountered when incorporating constraints directly into the problem formulation.  My research aims to develop control algorithms that allow for consistent and practical implementation of constrained optimization schemes on systems with fast dynamics.  This involves both the incorporation of generalized state, output and control constraints to fast computational schemes as well as the use and validation of techniques which apply approximate solutions and suboptimal control in order to allow for real-time computational limitations.



Optimization-based model predictive control (MPC) methodology will be used as a starting point for the development of control algorithms.  Applying MPC to a linear system with linear constraints using a quadratic cost function leads to a quadratic programming (QP) sub-problem.  I intend to investigate the application of non-feasible active set methods to the QP problem in order to formulate a new solution to the faster computation of the MPC problem.  The heavy computational burden which can occur also leads to the need to further investigate approximate solutions and real-time suboptimal control.  



Research in this area of constrained optimization and control would advance the field with the realistic possibility that consequential technologies could be transferred to Canadian industry with positive returns.  Furthermore, the importance of this area of research to industry makes it a fundamental area of importance for the training of HQP.

"The majority of the underground mining in Canada uses a method of extracting the ore called open stoping.  A stope is a large underground excavation where the ore has been blasted and removed and these opening can often be the size of a ten story apartment building.  The hanging wall and footwall of these openings follow the contact between the ore and the waste.  Waste rock failing or sloughing off these walls during mining mixes with the ore and dilutes the grade.  This sloughing of waste rock is called stope dilution and can create significant additional expense for mines since this material has to be hauled to surface, crushed and milled with the ore.

 

Reducing stope dilution is major goal for many underground mining operations.  One of the main factors governing hanging wall dilution is the strength of the rock mass.  The goal of this research is to improve the measurement and application of rock mass properties for stope design.  In the process of reaching this goal, methods of predicting hanging wall stability and dilution will be improved through better data collection, interpretation and analysis.  The current approach for assessing rock mass properties results in a single rock classification number.  The approach for determining this value is relatively insensitive to improved, more accurate methods of measuring the rock mass properties.  The methods used to link the various rock mass properties to obtain a single number have been fixed since the early 1970s, based on observations made primarily in civil engineering tunnel work.  Stope survey data present an untapped source of information linking opening geometry and rock mass properties to rock stability, measured as a depth of failure or hanging wall dilution.  This research will improve methods of quantifying rock mass properties as well as assist operating Canadian mines save money through reduced stope dilution.

"Dr. Milne applies computer models that account for the interactions between ice sheets, the solid Earth and sea level to simulate how the repeated growth and melting of ice sheets during Ice Ages has caused changes in sea level and motion of the land surface. Predictions from these models can be compared to a variety of geological and geophysical observations to better understand the nature of these interactions and study how ice sheets and sea levels have changed as a consequence of climate change both in the past and at present. 



These research outputs will have a number of direct benefits to Canada. For example, predictions of future sea-level changes will play a central role in assessing and mitigating the associated socio-economic and environmental risks. Also, models of land motion and sub-surface structure can be used in planning for improved infrastructure and aiding in the exploration of natural resources in regions such as the Canadian Shield and its margins.","Earth sciences","University of Ottawa",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�ophysique","G�ophysique"

"This proposal focuses on two areas of interest: Pricing and allocation in supply chains and service operations, and capacity and quality issues in the service sector with applications to health care.  A common problem in distribution is the determination of which customers to serve when there is a limited supply of inventory.  The proposal considers how a single retailer serving several classes of customers should allocate inventory and place orders from their supplier.  It also considers the case of multiple retailers serving multiple classes with a single supplier.  In addition I propose to model an endogenous spot market in such an environment and study its effect on inventory and allocation policy.  Within the context of service systems I pose the problem of pricing and allocation of rental and subscription services and the establishment of contract prices for customers seeking limited capacity over short durations.  Finally, I propose to develop models of demand variability within a hospital environment and capacity allocation models for diagnostic departments and treatment clinics such radiology, pathology, laboratory, and outpatient services such as transfusion and chemotherapy.

"The requested infrastructure represents an essential part of a NEW LABORATORY at the University of British Columbia aimed at studying ultra-cold molecules (temperatures below 1 Kelvin) and controlling cold molecular dynamics with ultra-short pulses (pulse length below 100 femtosecond). At low temperatures, molecular thermal motion is significantly suppressed and stops dominating the energy landscape of many fundamental molecular processes, i.e. molecular collisions and chemical reactions. Developing new approaches to controlling and studying cold molecular dynamics with ultrafast lasers is the main goal of this program.



In the proposed experimental facility, molecular motion will be harnessed by magnetic deceleration of a supersonic molecular beam. We will exploit recently emerged technology of magnetic deceleration, which, unlike laser cooling of alkali atoms, allows slowing any paramagnetic molecule down to sub-Kelvin kinetic energy. We will ""heat up"" cold molecules in a very special way with an ultrafast laser radiation. Unlike chaotic thermal heating, ultrashort laser pulses are capable of preparing well-defined coherent superpositions of molecular states, known as quantum wavepackets. Utilizing the coherence of an ultra-short laser pulse over an extremely broad range of frequencies, and the technique of femtosecond pulse shaping, we will study the effects of wavepacket dynamics on cold molecular processes, and the ability to control them.



The combination of multi-species cooling capability, extending beyond bi-alkalis, with ultrafast quantum state preparation is quite unique, and will position this new laboratory at the forefront of molecular physics in Canada and worldwide. No other laboratory in Canada is currently capable of producing high flux of cold molecules, and only a handful of such facilities exist in the world. Timely funding of this proposal is therefore absolutely crucial for securing Canadian leadership in this novel and innovative experimental field.","Physical sciences","University of British Columbia",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","�tudes atomiques et mol�culaires",Physique
"This work combines two complementary parts: (1) manipulation of the quantum states of atoms and molecules, and (2) coherent nonlinear spectroscopy, both by means of ultra-short (femtosecond) laser pulses with ""shaped"" temporal profile. 

(1) Since the invention of ultrafast lasers, the ""holy grail"" of many physicists and chemists has been the ability to precisely monitor and control a number of important dynamical processes which happen on extremely short time scale. These include atomic and molecular collisions, uni-molecular and bi-molecular reactions, collision-induced decoherence, etc. One of the most important aspects of these studies is the dependence of the molecular dynamics on the quantum state of a molecule. Our work aims at developing ways for accurate preparation of complex molecular quantum states (or ""wavepackets"") for the purpose of studying state-selective physical and chemical processes. Ultra-short pulses are especially suited for such quantum state preparation as their temporal profile can me matched to the dynamical properties of the desired wavepacket, exciting it with very high efficiency and selectivity.

(2) Ultra-short pulses are also very useful in detecting complex molecular wavefunctions because they can serve as a fast optical gate of molecular dynamics. High field amplitudes at low average power make femtosecond lasers ideal for coherent nonlinear spectroscopy and microscopy. However, owing to the broad spectral width of ultra-short pulses, femtosecond spectroscopy often lacks frequency resolution. Our work aims at improving the spectral resolution of ultrafast spectroscopic methods without losing the advantages of spectrally broad laser light. We also investigate the propagation of femtosecond pulses in highly scattering random media, such as clouds, biological tissues or layered photonic structures, which must be understood for much needed expansion of nonlinear ultrafast spectroscopy from laboratory settings to field applications.

"Einstein's theory of general relativity is one of the two great contributions of modern mathematics to theoretical physics.  In effect, general relativity _is_ geometry, the abstract study of non-Euclidean curved space.  The physical properties that govern the motion of stars, planets, galaxies indeed the entire universe arise from an analysis of such geometry.



Historically, the mathematics of curved abstract spaces (manifolds) anticipated the application to physics.  The initial formulation is due to Bernhard Riemann who work in the latter half of the 19th century, and by mathematicians such as Sophus Lie and Elie Cartan.  Indeed, the two disciplines --- mathematics on the one hand and the theoretical physics of general relativity --- develop in a parallel, intertwined fashion.  I hope to be able to make a contribution by developing certain mathematical aspects of the theory.","Mathematical sciences","Dalhousie University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Math�matiques de la physique","Math�matiques appliqu�es"

"This research seeks deeper understanding of key chemical reactions which occur on the surfaces of catalysts and electrocatalysts. These reactions lie at the heart of attractive alternate energy conversion technologies and currently constitute a major barrier to their use. Greater energy efficiency and flexibility combined with lower environmental impact requires improvements in the basic chemistry - which we hope will result from the understanding gained in this work. The processes include the use of hydrogen as an energy ""currency"" by improving our ability to make methanol from hydrogen and carbon dioxide, thus ""storing"" hydrogen chemically and providing safer transport and storage as well as being a useful fuel in this form. Also addressed are the surface reactions at the electrodes in fuel cells, particularly the activation of oxygen. This simple reaction is a major barrier to the widespread introduction of fuel cells for distributed power generation, including automobiles. A third target lies at the heart of processes to efficiently convert waste carbonaceous material to clean, high value natural gas. The increased understanding in the fundamental mechanisms of these reactions should enable improvements to these attractive technologies. In this program,advanced analytical techniques, recently available will be used to observe the details of the surface chemistry involved and provide this understanding.

"The numerical simulation of multicomponent and multiphase flows has important applications in Chemical and Biomedical Engineering. In the past we have developed algorithms and computer codes for the direct simulation of the dynamics of rigid particles and drops and bubbles in viscous fluids. During the next five years we plan to extend the free boundary algorithms to incorporate a surface rheology that accounts for the presence of elastic membranes so that we can simulate the behaviour of blood cells in shear flows.  The red blood cells are subjected to large shears in many practical situations like the flow around artificial heart valves for example, and often they can not survive the stress exerted on them.  Therefore, it is important to simulate numerically their behaviour in a variety of shear flows and estimate their chances to survive. 



Another application of the algorithms developed so far is for the simulation of flows involving moving objects with a complex shape.  A good example are the progressive cavity pumps.  We are planning to do extensive numerical simulations of such flows.



Finally we will continue the work on some fundamental issues in Numerical Analysis related to the algorithms that we develop.

"The applicant and his graduate students will consider the following questions: The study of oscillations of systems of differential equations and their extensions with a view at unifying discrete and continuous problems. We propose a further exploration of non-self adjoint systems oscillations of ordinary differential equations, a field left unexplored since Wintner's last paper in 1956. Along with a doctoral student we will also consider conditions for the degeneracy of a three-term Sturm-Liouville operator. 

In the study of the spectral theory of the Sturm-Liouville equation there is an important problem; that of determining sufficient conditions for the existence of non-real eigenvalues for Dirichlet problems in non-symmetric (non selfadjoint) cases,  and to determine a priori bounds on their location. There is no parallel theory anywhere at the moment that can do this. As a group we also wish to continue to explore the theory behind fuzzy cellular automata, constructs that can be used to create simple program that perform very difficult tasks and can be used to model the quantum mechanical world where events are inherently probabilistic. The idea here is to relate these fuzzy CA to high order perceptrons in the theory of neural networks.  Finally we will exploit the theory of principal solutions of three-term recurrence relations and apply this to irrationality questions in number theory. All these topics are related at a basic level via the qualitative theory of differential and difference equations. An in-depth study of factorial functions over sets of integers is to be undertaken with an eye at eventually defining new gamma functions and obtaining irrationality/transcendence results for series containing such factorials. Curiously enough Ramanujan's highly composite numbers (1915) seem to enter this theory in a natural way. The study of abstract factorials may help shed some light on the relationships between such sequences of factorials and highly composite numbers. It would be beneficial for a PhD candidate to study this.

"In recent years scientists and engineers have used random matrices in applications ranging from 2-dimensional quantum gravity, wireless communications, passive sonar, high dimensional inference, and mathematical finance. Random matrices are also studied extensively in mathematics itself: probability theory, operator algebras, number theory, and algebraic geometry.

   A random matrix is a matrix whose entries are random variables. The study of random matrices began around eighty years ago with the statistical work of John Wishart. Around fifty years ago Eugene Wigner used the eigenvalue distribution of an ensemble of random matrices to model the energy level of neutrons in an atomic nucleus.

   In the past five years I have developed a new branch of Voiculescu's free probability that makes possible for the first time a systematic calculation of the limiting distribution of the global fluctuations of sums and products of a general class of random matrices.

   A difficult and persistent problem has been the calculation of the distribution of various statistics of the model, typically involving eigenvalues. Explicit formulas are known only for the simplest cases. Once one considers products and sums of random matrices exact formulas become difficult or impossible and until recently one had had to rely on numerical simulations. The problem is then to calculate the limiting behaviour of the eigenvalue distributions. Whenever we have a collection of random matrices which satisfy a condition known as 'asymptotic freeness' there are universal rules for calculating the limiting distributions of sums and products of members of the collection. I have found, in collaboration with Roland Speicher, universal rules for calculating the global fluctuations of these distributions. The research and attendant training of 15 - 20 students will be great benefit to Canadian science and engineering.

"Analog, mixed-signal (designs that include both analog and digital subcircuits), and radio-frequency (RF) building blocks are often the performance bottleneck of communication systems and microsystems. These blocks usually dictate the speed and/or power consumption of the system. The goal of this research is to develop circuit design techniques and transceiver architectures that are suited to high-performance highly integrated wireless/wireline communication systems as well as microsystems. The emphasis of the research is on the systems implemented in deep submicron bulk CMOS technologies and operating in the frequency ranges up to a few tens of GHz. Bulk CMOS technologies have emerged as promising low-cost alternative (as opposed to compound semiconductor technologies such as GaAs) for high-performance integrated solutions. In, addition CMOS technologies provide the possibility of integrating analog and digital circuitry on the same chip and are suitable candidates for mixed-signal microsystems. However, advances in bulk CMOS technologies are mainly driven by the digital world and therefore digital performance metrics of CMOS technologies have grown significantly faster than corresponding measures in analog, mixed-signal, and RF circuits. Although both analog and digital components take advantage of the higher speed of operation due to technology scaling, unlike their digital counterparts, analog circuits are more constrained by noise and accuracy requirements. Hence, the performance of analog, mixed-signal, and RF circuits often only conditionally benefits from technology scaling and can even deteriorate with the trend in decreasing supply voltages. In general, the net benefit of CMOS implementation of systems due to technology scaling, that is, the overall performance improvement due to (re-)designing systems in a more advanced CMOS technology, is a strong function of the system architecture and circuit design techniques. Therefore, it is the goal of this research to develop new CMOS-friendly circuit design techniques for analog, mixed-signal, and RF building blocks in advanced CMOS technologies.

"Non-motorized transportation (NMT) modes such as walking and cycling are essential to the development of sustainable transportation systems. Safe and efficient NMT can benefit Canada very substantially by reducing automobile traffic, reducing energy consumption and emissions, and improving health and fitness. To this effect, local authorities and urban transportation agencies both in Canada and abroad have identified safety and mobility of non-motorized modes as high priorities. Accordingly, significant investments are being allocated to various safety improvement programs directed at NMT. 



The establishment of cost-effective safety improvement programs requires decision-making tools tailored to non-motorized transportation. The development of such tools involves: (1) an in-depth understanding of NMT accident factors and the adaptation of the latest methods for modelling accident patterns to non-motorized modes; (2) the development of evaluation methods to identify the benefits of safety interventions such as management speed strategies; and (3) a rigorous exploration of how NMT is evolving in urban Canada. This research program is designed to bring these three streams of research together through three related research projects. The specific objectives of these projects are: (i) to improve existing models and methods for the identification of accident factors and hazardous locations for safety improvements to pedestrian and bicycle facilities at intersections; (ii) to investigate the effects of speed limit reductions and other factors on pedestrian and bicycle injury severities; and (iii) to study the impact that long-term changes (e.g., socioeconomics, car ownership, information-and-communication technology (ICT), land use and accessibility indicators) have on urban travel and activity patterns with special focus on non-motorized mobility at the individual and household levels.

"I have concentrated my efforts on developing alternative number theories and implementations of intelligent systems, and consequently alternative forms of signal processing. The objectives of the proposed research are:

(a)Design and implementation of fully analog neural networks based on the Continuous Valued Number System (CVNS) Adaline model for intelligent signal processing. High performance implementation of neural networks using integrated circuits remains an active research area, since such systems can be applied in system-on-chip applications where computational tasks have to be performed in real time. The eventual goal is to surpass the biological models in compactness, power efficiency, and real time performances. (b)Developing equivalent functions of Finite-Impulse-Response (FIR) filter, and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) based on the CVNS theory, and implementation of these functions with application in hard-disk based audio players based on analog signal processing application. (c)Design and implementation of low-power area efficient digital multipliers with application in low-power filters and real-time signal processing. 

In the last three decades with the significant advancements in digital technology almost all of the computational operations and signal processing tasks are based on the binary signals.  However, digital technology faces problems with the increasing demand on higher speed and lower area, lower power and lower system noise, and cross-talk noise, specially in handheld and portable media devices. Extending the battery life of portable devices has become the main design criteria as more functionality is integrated into these devices. The CVNS can offer an alternative method of computation to overcome some of these design limitations. The resultant designs will be implemented as a hardware proof-of-concept system.

The proposed research seeks to develop special processing modules and circuit techniques and optimize arithmetic structures based on this approach for data representation to meet the future needs of the audio processing, and intelligent signal processing.

The aim of this proposal is to advance the research and deployment of standardized wireless personal area networks (WPANs) in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for healthcare and environmental/agricultural monitoring areas. Deployment of standardized WPAN technologies will greatly increase the chances to obtain cost-effective solutions for ubiquitous WSNs for healthcare and environmental/agricultural monitoring. In health monitoring we will design patient's unobtrusive personal WSN in order to match the bandwidth needs of particular health variable. We will also design device which will interconnect mobile patient's personal WSN to healthcare institution's network. On top of patient's personal WSN and institution's network we will design security protocols for integrity, privacy and availability of sensed health data according to the security policy in medical information systems. Finally, we will develop intrusion detection system in the overall healthcare network. In environmental/agricultural applications such as monitoring of conditions around power transmission lines or grain/crop conditions, area or volume under surveillance is large and needs to be covered with temporally and spatially uniform information throughput over long periods of time. This is a challenging problem since sensors die gradually due to battery power exhaustion and can't be easily replaced. To solve this problem, we will develop heterogeneous network architecture, power management techniques, interconnection devices and power aware routing in order to prolong network life-time over the whole coverage area under controlled information throughput. We will also develop localization and visualization techniques as a user interface. Security is even bigger concern in environmental sensing applications due to the lack of physical supervision. We will develop key management and authentication protocols for environmental monitoring sensor networks as well as intrusion detection system. In our research we will use both analytical and simulation techniques to develop interconnection and security protocols.

"Attitude stability is of considerable importance for successful completion of any space mission. Several methods of attitude determination and stabilization of satellites have been developed over the last five decades. The proposed project will explore the feasibility of a novel attitude control method using fluid rings in a pyramid arrangement. Such an attitude control system appears to have certain advantages such as relatively large control torque for its size, light weight and low cost. These fluid rings have the potential to be used for attitude determination and thermal control as well. Two mathematical models will be developed to study the dynamics of the satellite fitted with the proposed system: the first one will assume the fluid rings to be rigid, while the second one will consider the structural flexibility of the fluid rings. Algorithms for attitude control, attitude determination and thermal control using the proposed fluid-ring system will be developed. The concept will be validated by conducting experiments. If the simulation and experimental results are encouraging, a prototype will be built.

"The objective of the proposed research program is to study dynamics and control of a set of aerospace systems. The projects are a mix of curiosity-driven and applied projects. Specifically, the following problems will be examined.



(i) A set of satellites flying in a formation can be modelled as a single entity equivalent to a quasi-rigid body. There are many techniques available for controlled reorientation of rigid and flexible bodies. The goal of this project is to adapt these techniques for reorientation of satellite formations.



(ii) Due to the irregular shape of asteroids as well as their rotational states, their gravitational field is very different from the simple inverse square ones. This results in quite complex orbital and attitude dynamics of satellites orbiting an asteroid. The goal of this project is to study the coupled orbital and attitude motion of a satellite orbiting an asteroid.



 (iii) The space elevator might become an alternative in the future to the conventional methods of launching satellites. There exist several technological obstacles at present to make the space elevator a reality. A partial space elevator, on the other hand, is feasible with the current state of technology. The goal of this project is to study the performance of partial space elevators.



(iv) Study of nonlinear dynamics of shells subjected to internal and/or annular flows will be continued.

"In cellulosic ethanol industries, roughly equal amounts of ethanol and lignin are produced on a quantum basis. The forecasted 100 billion gallon of biomass ethanol to be produced per year will be accompanied by around 300 billion kilograms of lignin. One of the challenging issues for the cellulosic ethanol industry is to investigate value-added products from the lignin. This present proposal looks to investigate the highly efficient low-cost synthesis of continuous carbon nanofibre structures from undervalued lignin by an advanced electrospinning techniques followed by controlled carbonisation.  It also will study their application in alternative energy devices as a substitute for high cost traditionally produced carbon nanofibres and nanotubes. The lignin from bioethanol production is structurally different than lignin from paper industries. Therefore, this project also takes the novel approach of investigating different lignins forms from varied feedstocks and pre-treatments as used in the cellulosic ethanol industry. This will add new knowledge to the understanding of lignin structures and their conversion to carbon nanofibre by electrospinning. Lignin has an advantage as a precursor for the synthesis of carbon nanostructures due to its high carbon content, which expected to give an excellent yield of carbon nanofibres. The overall goal of this project is to accelerate the industrial use of nano-bio-materials by creating a scientific knowledge base. This foundation will be established by combining fundamental science with economically viable process technologies to ensure applicability to industry. Success in the utilization of lignin, a ""bio-refinery byproduct,"" as a source of raw materials for carbon nanofibres, will satisfy various federal laws and regulations that encourage the use of biobased materials, while providing additional income to the biofuel industries. The emergence of a Canadian knowledge base for new nanobiomaterials will enhance the global competitiveness for the Canadian alternative energy device manufacturing sector.

"Magnetic properties of materials of significant interest in biology, medicine, and industry will be studied by multi-frequency continuous-wave (CW) and pulsed electron magnetic resonance (EMR) techniques, using paramagnetic centres as probes at active sites in these materials. The EMR technique is based on the same principle as that of MRI (Magetic resonance imaging) technique used in hospitals. 

   1. Multifrequency CW EMR of active sites.   The CW EMR measurements will be carried out in the temperature interval -271 C to +25 C at microwave frequencies in the 9.0 to 350 GHz range. We will measure: 1A. single crystals of rare-earth silicon oxides Y2SiO5 and La2Si2O7  doped with paramagentic ions; 1B. Amorphous materials:(i) Nanodomains: a) Dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS).  These are oxide materials doped by cobalt and iron ions; b) Ceramics. (ii) Metalloproteins contining doubly ionized iron and triply ionized manganese ions, of importance in biology and medicine. 

   2. Pulsed EMR. Theoretical calculations will be carried out, taking into account the dipolar interaction between two nitroxide probes that depends on their distance, of signals for: 2A. 2D-ELDOR (two-dimensional electron-electron double resonance); 2B. DQC (double quantum coherence) and DEER (double electron-electron resonance). 

     The significances of the proposed research are: (1) The ""single-crystals""  will  be developed as lasers, phosphors, and materials to be used as replacement  for silicon dioxide gate dielectrics. (2) The DMS samples have the potential to be developed as (spintronic) mass storage devices in hard disks of computers. (3) Novel insights into metalloproteins of interest in biology and medicine will be acquired by developing a better understanding of the properties of exchange-coupled iron centres in these proteins. (4) The pulsed EMR simulations would be used  for distance measurements in biological systems, a topic on the cutting edge of research, providing clues to blueprints in life in the human genome project.

"Infection with a herpesvirus (the human herpes simplex virus, HSV-1 is an example) begins with active replication of the virus in skin cells at the site of entry. The virus then infects sensory nerves innervating the area of virus replication and establishes a latent infection in nerve cells. Here it quietly remains, protected from the host's defenses. In response to environmental or physiological stress the latent virus in nerve cells reactivates periodically to replicate and reinfect skin cells. The molecular basis for the establishment of latency has long been an intriguing and perplexing puzzle for virologists, a puzzle that has not as yet been solved. The objective of our research is to determine how HSV-1 senses when its host is stressed. Our work will not only help us to understand how herpesviruses establish latency and reactivate from it, it will also tell us how cells of the nervous system respond to stress.

    )	We have discovered two human proteins, which may hold the key to herpesvirus latency and reactivation. We have named these proteins Luman and Zhangfei after mythical characters in the Beijing opera.  In pain-sensing nerve cells (the very cells in which HSV becomes latent) in unstressed animals Zhangfei appears to suppress HSV-1 replication and, we think, directs it into latency. Luman is capable of activating HSV-1 gene expression and we think that in the nerve cells of stressed animals it reactivates latent virus.

    )	During our studies we have discovered some interesting things about what Zhangfei's normal role in the animal might be. It seems to be involved in the development of the pain-sensing nerve cells in the developing embryo. In medulloblastoma (a childhood nerve cell cancer) no Zhangfei is made. However, if we now get these rapidly dividing cells to make Zhangfei, they stop dividing and start looking like mature nerve cells.

    )	Over the next five years we propose to investigate how Zhangfei and Luman influence HSV-1 replication, latency and reactivation. We will also try to find out what the two proteins do in normal, uninfected nerve cells.

"Pattern management refers to a set of activities related to the description, manipulation and storage of patterns in a similar (but more elaborated) way as data are managed by database applications. In pattern management and inductive databases, patterns are knowledge artifacts extracted from a data mining process (generally conducted beforehand), and are retrieved upon user request.



The objectives of the proposed research program are threefold: (1) handle the problem of pattern manipulation by defining operations on patterns, (2) study the problem of enriching and updating a pattern set (e.g., association rules) when changes occur in the user's needs and the input data (e.g., new objects/attributes, negation or taxonomy), and (3) design procedures and tools for navigating between multidimensional (or even bidimensional) data and related patterns so that data/information can enrich existing patterns and patterns can augment data with knowledge. For the second topic, the problem may be challenging in case of negation, i.e., when the presence as well as the absence of attributes (items) are sought, and when a partial set of patterns is given.



Another objective of this research is to carry on our ongoing work on mining and approximating multidimensional data in data warehouses.



Since formal concept analysis is an attractive and sound framework for mining concepts and rules, we will use it as the main framework for handling the proposed research activities and we will focus on patterns in the form of association rules and concepts.

"The behaviour and physiology of mammals is regulated by endogenous circadian (24 h) clocks in the brain and in peripheral organs and tissues. These clocks generate daily rhythms of sleep-wake, appetite and body temperature and coordinate the functions of all organ systems with daily cycles of light-dark and mealtimes. A master circadian clock located in the hypothalamus is critical for synchronizing daily rhythms to light-dark cycles, but synchrony to mealtimes is mediated by one or more other circadian clocks at an unknown location. Our research aims to understand  the brain mechanisms by which food regulates daily rhythms. Recent advances in the molecular biology of circadian timekeeping have identified a number of genes that exhibit circadian rhythms of expression, and that form interlocking feedback loops that produce self-sustaining, cell autonomous rhythmicity. We will use immunocytochemical and photometric techniques to measure clock genes and identify brain regions that oscillate in synchrony with one or two daily mealtimes. We will explore the role of specific rhythmic brain regions in the control of meal synchronized rhythms, using lesion techniques. We will explore the role of specific clock genes for meal synchronized rhythms using clock gene mutant mice. Finally, we will characterize the effects of meal timing and food deprivation on the rate at which behavioural and physiological rhythms re-synchronize following phase shifts of the light-dark cycle, simulating east or west travel or shift work rotations. The results of these studies will clarify neural and molecular mechanisms by which food regulates daily rhythms and may suggest techniques for minimizing disruption of circadian rhythms following travel or shift rotation.",Psychology,"Simon Fraser University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Neurologie du comportement",Psychologie
"Understanding how pollutants move through the environment and are transformed within it is important to developing plans for mitigating pollutant effects.  Some pollutants, including heavy metals, strongly bind to soil and other solids in the environment.  Despite this affinity, these pollutants continue to move into aquatic ecosystems when soils are flushed by rainstorms or melting snow.  Linking the movement of water and chemical reactions in the environment together at appropriate spatial and temporal scales is difficult, but critical to providing the process information necessary to deal with changing levels of pollution and possible alterations to the environment (climate change, logging).  Recent advances in techniques involving enriched stable (non-radioactive) isotopes should provide a means for linking these processes.  The pollutant to be studied in this research program is mercury, a toxic metal.  Mercury is particularly dangerous because it can undergo biogeochemical transformations in the environment that form methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin that accumulates in fish and wildlife.  The consumption of fish is the primary pathway for human exposure.  Through a number of controlled laboratory and field experiments using stable isotopes, this research will first investigate and develop a model of how mercury moves between ecosystem compartments such as forests and wetlands.  It will then investigate the spatial and temporal variability of this movement and its effects on the production of methylmercury.  This information will be used to directly test how logging affects the movement and transformation of mercury in watersheds.  Together, this knowledge will lead to more predictive possibilities from models, an improved understanding of how land-use changes affect mercury cycling, and an opportunity to develop effective strategies for preventing further methylmercury pollution in watersheds.

"Emotional information gains rapid and often preferential access to our brain's processing resources. This ""emotional attention"" enables us to quickly detect and respond to dangerous or pleasant aspects of our environment. However, dwelling on emotional information can be disruptive or even dangerous. Some situations require calm precision even while we are being bombarded with emotionally salient cues (e.g., emergency response or trauma surgery). Fortunately, the human brain has also evolved systems that help reprioritize information processing, minimize distraction, and bias our attention towards the most behaviourally relevant information. My research aims to determine how the human brain performs this mental balancing act. Although aspects of attention have been well-researched, we have only begun to investigate how the brain prioritizes and controls the effects of competing emotional information on behaviour. In humans, this work has focussed on competition between different visual cues. There is still much to be learned in the visual domain, and we know even less about these processes in the auditory system. Recent findings suggest that a degree of specialization exists in the brain for processing distinct classes of emotional information (e.g., positive versus disgusting stimuli). Yet we know little about how conflicting classes of emotional information are prioritized or represented in the human brain within and between sensory systems. My research uses behavioural and brain imaging techniques to measure the impact of emotionally salient information on brain activity and behaviour. These techniques are used with healthy individuals and people with acquired brain lesions following surgical procedures or injuries. These methods provide fundamental knowledge about the brain regions involved in and necessary for representing and controlling emotional information. Because this research examines the conditions under which competing streams of relevant and irrelevant emotional information capture our attention and influence our judgement, it will have applications for the selection and training of surgeons, emergency response personnel, air-traffic controllers, pilots, and defence personnel.",Psychology,"University of Western Ontario",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Neurologie du comportement",Psychologie

"I propose development of a Hamilton-Jacobi Workshop (HJW), which is a collection of algorithms and implementations for approximating the solution of both the time dependent and stationary versions of the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) partial differential equation (PDE).  This equation shows up in such diverse fields as fluid and combustion simulation, graphics and animation, image processing and computer vision, financial mathematics, robotics and optimal control, and verification; for this reason it has received considerable research attention.  My research agenda is distinct from and complementary to the study of this equation undertaken by numerical analysts.  While that community has developed powerful, efficient and accurate numerical methods, researchers and practitioners from other fields find it difficult to choose among and implement the various schemes, and students new to HJ PDEs must replicate an enormous software infrastructure to demonstrate their own contributions.  Therefore, my research will focus on developing easy to use and extensible implementations at the cutting edge of accuracy and power, yet factorized in such a manner as to provide graceful flexibility for trying various alternative schemes.  Where necessary the code may not achieve optimal execution efficiency, but with access to all of the source code users can tune or reimplement once they have determined the best schemes for their particular application.  Such a collection of techniques cannot be developed in isolation, and this research will be informed by feedback from HJW users and by personal study in application fields, such as provably safe control synthesis and filtering for vehicles, path planning under dynamic motion constraints and multiple objectives, and automated tools for reachability in continuous and hybrid systems.","Computer software","University of British Columbia",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Algorithmes,"Technologie de l'information"
"The G protein coupled signal transduction systems are expressed in most cells of the body and in most living organisms. The invertebrate visual system that we study is the fastest G protein-coupled system in all biology. In my laboaratory we are conducting research in the invertebrate North Atlantic squid that has large eyes that are very similar in structure to humans.  Over the past fifteen years my laboratory has isolated many of the proteins involved in the visual system of the squid and we have cloned DNAs encoding these proteins. We have uncovered many of the molecular interactions that both activate and inactivate the visual process in squid and these have led us to a better understanding of how these types of signalling systems work.



We are now proposing a series of studies that examine how these proteins interact and regulate each others functions. These studies will help to understand how this system works so rapidly. Our studies use many molecular and biochemical methods that we have developed and in the process will train many graduate and undergraduate students. Our studies will help us understand how visual systems work and develop new techniques and reagents that can be used by us and others in biological research.

"Research on the mineralogy and petrology of alkaline rocks is fundamental to our understanding of the evolution of the Earth's upper mantle and the origins of strategic mineral resources. The latter include diamond, niobium, tantalum, rare earth elements, zirconium and phosphorous. Many of the minerals found in alkaline rocks are the counterparts of compounds currently used in diverse electronic devices and for sequestering radioactive waste.Insights into the structure and composition of these minerals has proved valuable in the design of inorganic materials used for the above purposes. Alkaline rocks studied in this research are derived from kimberlite, carbonatite and agpaitic syenite magmas. This group of apparently diverse magmas are linked in that upper mantle metasomatic processes play a role in their genesis. The long term objective of the work is to determine the nature of these processes and relationships, or lack of, between the various magma types. This problem is addressed by detailed studies of the composition and paragenesis of the minerals present in these rock types together with experimental studies at low and high pressures of their synthetic analogs. Experimental studies include near-solidus to supra-liquidus crystallization studies and investigation of the solubility of metals in the synthetic analogs. The novelty of the work as a whole is that diverse mineralogical, petrological, experimental and crystaallographics studies are combined to provide insights into the genesis of these magmas and associated mineral deposits.

"Mangroves form intertidal fringing communities along the coastlines of continents, islands and atolls, and are a key component of the coral reef-seagrass-mangrove ecosystem complex. Red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle L.) grows in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It is the dominant

mangrove species in the Caribbean, where the return period for hurricanes varies from 15 to 50 years. The disturbance ecology of mangrove communities is complex. While they are known to protect coastlines and coastal communities from storm surge and coastal erosion during storms, they are often severely damaged during these events. Unlike some mangrove species, red mangrove does not recover vegetatively from uprooting or severe defoliation, but through growth of surviving seedlings or recolonization. Recolonization is limited by wave energy and substrate stability. Once established, red mangroves spread through horizontal shoot development and formation of aerial prop roots, and forming dense shoot and aerial root networks.



The objectives of this research are to examine the loading, deformation and resistance of red mangroves in air and water under low and high energy conditions, and examine how root and shoot architecture and mechanical properties vary with maturity and along gradients of exposure to routine wave and wind energy. This research is an extension of our study of the disturbance and recovery of mangrove communities in Turneffe Atoll, Belize following Hurricane Hattie in 1961. There has been very little research on the biomechanics of mangroves and in particular the red mangrove. In this research we will adapt techniques for measurement of

loading and resistance used in work with terrestrial trees and marine algae for work with woody plants in the intertidal environment. We will use horizontal and vertical pulling tests and will measure drag and deformation in a wind tunnel and flume. The results will be integrated into our modelling of mangrove disturbance dynamics.

"The lack of an acceptable hydrogen storage media is a critical missing component in allowing for widespread commercial utilization of fuel cells in mobile, hand-held and stationary commercial applications. Magnesium has promise for solid-state hydrogen storage because of the relatively high amount of hydrogen held in MgH2 (7.6wt.%) and because magnesium is inexpensive. The critical problem with magnesium is its unacceptably high charging and discharging temperature due to a relatively large negative heat of hydride formation (-76 kJ/mol). I am proposing to develop alloy Mg-Fe-Ti and Mg-Ti-Ni hydrogen storage nanocomposites. These systems are promising candidates since it may be possible to use the energy of the intermetallics (compounds of two or more elements, where at least one is a metal) formed in their hydrogen-free state to make the heat of formation less negative. I am proposing using alloy thin films as model systems to explore the role of composition and microstructure in the hydrogen storage properties. The alloy design methodology will be accompanied by direct microstructural characterization via cryogenic-stage transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This will give us direct insight into the features of the material necessary for proper adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics.

"The instrument requested in this proposal relates to an innovative non-intrusive flow measurement technique for micro/nano-scale devices which combines the molecular tagging velocimetry  (MTV) with evanescent wave field. This will allow us to quantify the velocity field within a few hundred nanometers (nm) from the channel walls where phenomena like slip, wall charge interactions, etc. are dominant.  Such velocity measurements will be important to validate the theoretical models for the near wall phenomena and will substantially improve our understanding of fluid flow in micro and nanochannels. Existing techniques rely on seed particles which are typically around 100 - 200 nm in diameter and hence are not able to accurately resolve the flow field at the wall. By using the proposed evanescent wave field, a phenomenon which is confined within a few hundred nanometers of the investigated surface and relies on the total internal reflection of the light source, in conjunction with the existing MTV system will allow us to resolve such flow fields. This coupling will be rendered by procuring a high numerical aperture objective and related optics and beam steering mechanisms, which will then be integrated with the existing ""in-house"" developed MTV system, thereby creating a unique measurement technique for microfluidics applications.

"Today's perceived scarcity of quality spectrum for next generation wireless applications is due in part to the large number of legacy applications currently enjoying exclusive access to what is often among the best quality spectrum. This is compounded by the fact that these legacy incumbent users under-utilize their spectral resources. The goal of this research is to study fundamental performance limits, tradeoffs, and enabling algorithms to configure and deploy cognitive radio networks that are capable of providing prioritized spectrum access, thereby providing the needed bandwidth for next generation technology while preserving prioritized access for legacy applications. Our work will span several layers of the network, starting with the physical layer and including the medium access control (MAC) layer, and network layer. More specifically, some of the issues that will be addressed are the design of modulation and coding schemes that can exploit spectral opportunities, methods by which to determine spectral opportunities, adaptive resource allocation algorithms, cognitive network co-existence algorithms as well as quantifying the broader gains that cognitive networks provide. One of the key objectives of the proposed research is the training of graduate student researchers and post-doctoral research associates in an area of strategic importance to the Canadian information technology industry.

"In recent years, the use of wireless networks has witnessed explosive growth due to the freedom and mobility they provide to their end users. It is not an understatement to say that wireless communication has revolutionized the way society functions. The freedom and mobility that current and near future technology can provide comes at a cost though - that of typically expensive centralized infrastructure. 



Ad Hoc wireless networks provide a method to untether wireless devices from centralized infrastructure and, in principle, provide more freedom to their users while eliminating the need for costly and time-consuming centralized network planning. Such distributed networks find application in sensor networks, can provide rapidly deployed critical communication infrastructure in disaster relief areas and potentially result in novel medical applications such as body area networks for health monitoring.



The research proposed in this application aims to further the understanding of distributed wireless networks from physical layer and network coding perspectives. The goal is to develop techniques that result in robust distributed wireless networks as well as further the understanding of the fundamental tradeoff between such measures as reliability, throughput and delay. There will be four thrusts: 1) information theoretic modeling, 2) development of tradeoffs between network coding and physical layer techniques, 3) development of distributed resource allocation algorithms, 4) development of practical coding and synchronization algorithms. 



The results of this research will also be applicable to wireless networks with centralized infrastructure and the research will have technological impact on next generation wireless networks from the mobile device level to the network architecture.

"In a globally competitive minerals market, Canadian mines continue to face the pressure to reduce costs. One approach to reducing mining costs is by the reduction of unplanned interruptions to production for the rehabilitation of haulage drifts. These drifts are the principal roadways for haulage trucks and load-haul-dump vehicles, which transport the blasted ore from the mining block or stope to the nearest ore transfer facility such as an ore pass. Unplanned interruptions to production can have adverse influence on the cost of mining and ultimately on the profitability of an operation. Drift rehabilitation involves the installation of additional ground supports to help the drift regain its stability and functionality. Thus, it would be advantageous to be able to know ahead of time when and where a haulage drift is due for maintenance or support enhancement during its service life so that a preventive maintenance program can be scheduled and implemented in a timely fashion without interruption to production. Currently, there are no established guidelines to help the mine planner assess drift stability condition as it changes (deteriorates) with mining activities. The goal of this research project is thus to develop new design tools capable of predicting the location, timing and magnitude of required drift support enhancement with respect to scheduled mining activities during the service life of the drift. With these new tools, interruption to production schedule can be eliminated or minimized thus reducing cost. The new design tools will be developed from the study of the geotechnical risk of drift instability and how it is affected by the extraction of nearby mining blocks. Drift geotechnical stability is determined from numerical (computer) modelling analyses which account for the rock mass properties as well as the geometric configuration of the mining system and block extraction sequence. Model results are then compared with measurements and /or observations from the field to validate the models. The project case study is the Garson Mine of Vale Inco Limited. While the study is focused on the Garson Mine, its findings will be applicable to many other underground metal mines in Canada and other mining countries.

"In a global competitive minerals market, there is continued pressure on mines to reduce costs. One approach to reducing mine costs is by the reduction of ore dilution. Unplanned ore dilution has a direct influence on the cost of a mine stope and ultimately on the profitability of a mining operation. The economic impact of dilution is due to costs associated with the transportation and treatment of waste or low grade rock having little or no mineral value. The additional time required for the backfilling of the larger stope volumes produced by the occurrence of ore dilution due to the extraction of waste rock can also lead to production delays, changes to the mining schedule, and potentially, development rehab costs. The goal of this project is to quantify unplanned ore dilution (or overbreak) associated with longitudinal sublevel stoping method, by establishing new, numerical-empirical dilution models for stope and orezone design, with respect to anticipated stope overbreak and mine scheduling. Identified factors influencing unplanned dilution such as induced stress environment, stope geometry, and the stope setting within the orezone extraction sequence are to be considered. The project case study will be the Lapa Mine of Agnico Eagle Mines Limited located in the Abbitibi region of the province of Quebec. The project findings will be applicable to underground mines employing longitudinal, sublevel stoping to extract steeply dipping, tabular orezones with longhole mining. Such mining systems are commonly found in Canada, USA, Mexico, Australia and South America.","Natural resources (economic aspects)","McGill University",3,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","G�nie minier","G�nie minier et min�ral"

"The long term objective of my research is to improve food processing technology by analysis, experimentation, modelling, simulation and process optimization. This 5-year proposal is directed towards improving deep-fat frying using vacuum/ pressure, radio-frequency (RF), infra-red (IR) and hot air jet impingement for better quality and safety of value-added low-fat fried food products. Specifically: (i) our previous models on deep-fat frying will be modified for emerging vacuum/ pressure frying for faster, reduced fat and better quality fried foods; (ii) suitable edible films will be tried under vacuum/pressure frying to reduce fat in fried foods; (iii) a novel technology ""air frying"" will be developed by using RF and/or IR and impingement hot air flow for food products as an alternate for deep-fat frying providing faster, fat free and energy efficient processing, and (iv) development of an online sensor array to determine oil quality during deep-fat frying. Our earlier oil quality sensor will be improved using sensor fusion techniques after testing various sensing devices. Three types of models, namely transport of heat, moisture and fat; dynamics of crust formation and product shrinkage; and kinetics of product quality, microbial decay and nutritional integrity are required to describe cooking processes. Appropriate numerical methods and simulation software will be used to solve the models. Locations of least cooking points are important in novel processes for microbial safety. The models will be validated by collecting experimental data. In ""air frying"" RF and/or IR will provide rapid and uniform heating of the food products similar to deep-fat frying, and crust will be developed by hot air striking the product at ultra high speed through impingement jets. These models will assist in process optimization for energy efficient, better quality, reduced fat, tasty and safe products; understanding of cooking and designing of better process/equipment, and efficient use of existing equipment. Overall it will provide useful information to Canadian food industry to remain ahead internationally in safe, tasty and quality foods. Low fat, energy efficient and faster processes will assist Canadian food industry to remain competitive world-wide.

"Proteins are central players in an enormous variety of cellular processes, thus understanding how they function is critical to understanding the molecular basis of life. Proteins are highly flexible molecules, and there is growing evidence that their internal dynamics play an essential, but still poorly understood, role in their biological activities. We will use three complementary biophysical techniques to relate the internal motions of protein molecules to their function: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).



NMR simultaneously detects the signals arising from hundreds of individual atoms within protein molecules, providing exquisitely detailed structural and dynamic information. ITC measures the heat absorbed or released when proteins interact with other molecules. DSC detects the heat absorbed or released by changes in protein structure. We will combine the information obtained from these three techniques to develop models of biological processes that explain WHAT happens, in terms of atomic-resolution structure and dynamics, and also WHY it happens, in terms of the laws of thermodynamics.



These studies will shed light on how protein dynamics influence i) the ability of proteins to spontaneously adopt functional, three-dimensional structures; ii) the interactions of proteins with other molecules; and iii) the catalytic activity of enzymes. The potential of using NMR, ITC and DSC in concert is only just starting to be explored. This research will help to develop a powerful new approach for understanding how living systems operate at the atomic level.

"The South West Ontario Nanotechnology Facility (SWONtF) consolidates resources and expertise originally supported and managed in 3 major laboratories at The University of Western Ontario (UWO): Surface Science Western (SSW), Interface Science Western (ISW) and the UWO Nanofabrication Laboratory (NL). The resources will henceforth be supported and managed as one entity within the Western Institute for Nanomaterials Science (WINS) providing new, open and affordable access for the South Western Ontario area and beyond for highly competitive interdisciplinary research on matter at the nanoscale. The nature and breadth of the combined resources and expertise in one location is unique in Canada. Significant infrastructure includes facilities to prepare new materials, determine mechanical properties, including nanotribology, and for nanoscale biology including microfluidics. All the tools necessary to design and fabricate materials and devices on the nanometer length scale, including optical lithography and interferometry, gas phase deposition, reactive ion etching, focused ion beam milling, e-beam lithography, LB deposition, electron microscopy, ellipsometry and various other characterization tools are available in the NL.  The major instruments in this application include: XPS; SIMS, TOF-SIMS, SEM-EDX, Raman Spectroscopy, FTIR, AFM, electrochemical methods, a Tandetron accelerator and associated MBE and ion scattering and implantation facilities, a van de Graaff accelerator and chambers, a positron accelerator for defect characterization, and OLED chambers. These resources thus provide for both the creation and analysis (characterization) of materials, devices, structures, and surfaces at the nanometer length scale. It supports research on electronic and photonic materials, on nanoscale chemistry and on mechanical properties of both hard and very soft materials, including live cells, on corrosion and wear, and the development of new tools and techniques, as well as demonstrative devices. The facilities are currently used by over 80 scientists and engineers.","Materials sciences","University of Western Ontario",3,"MRSIF ","Major Resources Support Program - Infrastructure","Science et technologie des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"
"In our modern world - with its highly sophisticated synthetic chemistry and pharmacy and the extraordinary developments in health sciences - monitoring of specific molecules is gaining an increasing importance. The detection of biological, pharmaceutical and chemical agents or the detection of sickness-fingerprinting proteins, enzymes and antigens in (cancer) patients needs to be carried out as specific and quickly as possible. Sometimes even on-line information is essential, e.g. during surgery or a synthesis routine in pharmaceutical production. A trend in this analytical research is miniaturisation and the use of surfaces instead of volume sensors. This will allow to place the ""sensor"" at critical positions, e.g. into tissue or a vessel of a patient. The proposed research focuses on three subjects. Firstly, the engineering of highly sensitive optical transducers will translate chemical information into a physically measurable quantity. Secondly, the design of optimised surfaces for chemical recognition reactions will allow for high specificity avoiding false positives. Thirdly, a new technology will be established to study cell-substrate interaction, e.g. for fostering implant technology. The surfaces of these optical transducers, waveguide devices and gold nanoparticles, carry a ""film of light"" during operation which detects changes in the ambient material. Molecules carrying a recognition site are immobilised on the sensor surface by chemical means. They are able to perform a recognition reaction if the fitting molecule is present in the ambient solution or air. The polarisation of light is also taken into account. Natural optically active proteins turn the polarisation direction of light. The turning power depends on the molecular intrinsic structure, as well as their biological function. A sensor will be developed detecting the molecular intrinsic structure of proteins, which are available only in minute amounts. 

The objective in this highly multidisciplinary research - with theoretical, practical and commercial implications - is to introduce miniaturized monitoring schemes dedicated to a brought field of application: environmental monitoring, medication and implant control and in-vivo sensing.

"This proposal is concerned with developing innovative solutions for motion and force control problems in mechatronic systems by utilizing new and cost-effective technologies. Advanced motion and force controllers have a wide range of applications such as medical mechatronic devices, haptic systems, tele-operation, factory automation, energy converters, and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). For example, in the field of medical technology, future endoscopic devices equipped with grasping fingers, or procedures involving robot-assisted insertion of a flexible catheter into a body organ, would require mechanisms equipped with novel sensors and actuators that are integrated with proper control and signal processing algorithms. In future drive-by wire vehicles, the bulky steering wheel could be replaced by a lightweight haptic device to improve energy efficiency while preserving safety. As all these systems continue to mature, requiring higher precision and greater performance levels, the challenge for developing novel technologies for force and motion control would grow. Advanced force/motion control systems are normally comprised of electronic, mechanical, and signal processing components such as sensors, actuators, robotic mechanisms, signal processing and control algorithms, and embedded computers. A main focus of the proposed research would be to develop innovative solutions that create a synergy between mechanical design, sensing and actuation mechanism, digital information processing, and feedback control algorithms. This research would require the blending together of concepts from disciplines in mechanical engineering, electronics, sensors and actuators, embedded computers, control and signal processing, and software engineering. 



This research would provide opportunities for graduate students and the researcher to work with and develop enabling technologies requiring multidisciplinary skills. These skills would be beneficial to Canadian industries in various strategic areas including health-care, energy, and advanced automation technologies.

"Image registration is a commonly used technique to align images or data acquired from different positions at different times or with different devices. The objective of image registration in a clinical environment is to align these views in order to produce a meaningful diagnosis or treatment planning. For example, the diagnosis and treatment of female breast cancer may require a time series of three-dimensional magnetic resonance images (MRI), visualizing the contrast uptake in the tissue. This uptake, divided into the so-called wash-in and wash-out phases, is of particular interest, since it characterizes tissue properties. Assuming the female breast to be static, a point based analysis would provide the uptake characteristics as a function in time. However, the acquisition time is usually around ten minutes and due to motion of the patient, like heart beat or breathing, the breast is not static and the interpretation of the data is weakened and complicated by motion artifacts.



Registration techniques are used to automatically compensate for image differences that are related to motion. However, common schemes do not prevent a change of volume of the processed data. This is very delicate, if tumor growth is under consideration. For these applications, only a volume preserving scheme guaranties that changes of volume is due to measurement and not to the alignment. Unfortunately, there are only two approaches to deal with volume preservation. The first one is suggested by Torsten Rohlfing et al and uses a spline based parametric transformation and penalty based on the integral over volume changes. This approach has some disadvantages. An alternative approach has been suggested by Eldad Haber and myself and is based on a more general non-parametric transformation and explicit constraints on a voxel basis. The essential advantage of the our approach is that it guarantees volume preservation, as has already been shown. However, this approach is computationally quite demanding and since a rigorous implementation is still missing, it can only handle low-resolution data. More research is needed to make this method clinically available.

"Of the five known mass extinction events, the Permo-Triassic extinction event is regarded unanimously as the most severe in Earth history. The consensus view has been that 70-90% of species became extinct 251 million years ago. Such estimates of high species mortality were based on ranks-based studies of low taxonomic resolution (family-level groups). My own investigations, using phylogenetic studies of higher resolution (species and genera), suggest that terrestrial vertebrates (tetrapods) experienced low extinction pressure during the Permo-Triassic extinction event.

     To date I have examined the Permo-Triassic boundary survivorship of amniotes (mammals, reptiles, birds, and their fossil relatives). The two reptile groups examined, procolophonoid parareptiles and archosauromorph diapsids, exhibit roughly 29% and 14-17% extinction, respectively. Current work on therocephalians, a group of synapsid amniotes, suggests that they experienced 43% extinction. Judging from published phylogenies, cynodont synapsids suffered 40-50% extinction. The evidence so far suggests that the amniote extinctions were not as severe as commonly believed, and that the effects of extinction were not even handed among the groups. 

     Procolophonoids and therocephalians are the most diverse and, after lystrosaurids, the most commonly encountered amniotes in the Karoo Basin of South Africa, the country with the best fossil record for studying the effect of this extinction event on tetrapods. I propose to continue my phylogenetically-based research on the survivorship of the above mentioned amniote groups through the Permo-Triassic boundary. I will expand my program by looking at the post-extinction survivorship of amniotes in the Karoo, in light of a recent suggestion that a ""survivor fauna"" succumbed to a second pulse of extinctions that followed the main extinctions at the Permo-Triassic boundary. The results of the study will help to elucidate the differences of effect of the Permo-Triassic extinctions on tetrapods with respect to that on plants and marine invertebrates, which experienced a single extinction pulse followed by a recovery period of 4-5 million years.

"There is a wide variety of organisms on this planet, yet one of the great unanswered questions in biology is how new species are formed and maintained at the genetic level.  The question of species formation and maintenance is critical for our understanding of evolution as well as the conservation of endangered species.  Two primary goals of research on species formation are determining the genetic factors that prevent interspecies reproduction and identifying the evolutionary forces driving their divergence.

     My research will identify genes contributing to the genetic basis of variation for reproductive traits both within and between species, which will provide new insight into the mechanisms by which new species arise as well as enhancing our general understanding of how variation in behavioural traits arise.  I will first characterize genes for variation in mating behaviour within Drosophila melanogaster.  Comparing these loci for within-species variation to those for between-species variation will allow me to address whether loci for variation within a species are the same as those causing divergence between species.  Therefore, I will also identify loci for mate discrimination between two species: an initial genome-wide map for D. simulans and D. sechellia; and mapping to individual loci for D. simulans and D. mauritiana.  Additional comparisons of these two interspecies data sets will allow me to address whether loci isolating D. simulans from D. sechellia and D. mauritiana are the same.  Lastly, I will localize factors influencing hybrid sterility by identifying the source of misexpression in the spermatogenesis pathway in D. simulans / D. sechellia and D. simulans / D. mauritiana hybrids.

     All of these studies will contribute to my broader goal of understanding the genetic basis of species formation and maintenance.  They will require genomics, Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping, transgenics, gene expression, and behavioural assays using the powerful model system of Drosophila.  These objectives and techniques complement my nomination as a Tier 2 Canada Research Chair in Functional Genomics.

"Our research contributions over the last decade have established us among the authorities in the field of germ cell development, specifically in functional and structural aspects of chromosomes at prophase of meiosis. Unlike somatic (body) cells that can go through repeated cell division and growth cycles in the body or in tissue culture, germ cells have a single development pathway - they do not cycle and there is no efficient method available for their culture.  Fortunately, it has been discovered that germ cells will develop rapidly - hours instead of days - when cultured in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid. With this technique, our laboratory and the laboratory of M.A. Handel have embarked on the analysis of factors that affect germ cell development. We investigate genetic mutations that affect meiosis as well as the effect of toxic substances and the experimental repression of proteins required for meiosis. The meiotic systems that we study are associated with fertilty defects and deregulation of cell proliferation (cancer). In addition, we are enlisted as consultants/research collaborators by two or three laboratories each year.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","York University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Division cellulaire","Biologie cellulaire"

"NSERC strategic involves the preparation, fabrication and characterization of amorphous selenium (a-Se) based alloys for use in ultra high resolution direct conversion x-ray image detectors (image sensors), for small area imaging. In a recent NIH (USA) grant with Sunnybrook Hospital we were able to demonstrate a prototype high resolution a-Se/CCD based small area x-ray detector suitable for slot scanning mammography in which the resolution was limited by charge carrier trapping in a-Se. In previous strategic and CRD (with Anrad) grants we have shown the relationship between resolution and charge trapping in the photoconductor. If charge trapping in a-Se can be reduced (ideally, eliminated) there is no reason why a-Se/CCD detectors with pixel sizes as small as 3 micron cannot be made feasible for ultra high resolution x-ray imaging of small areas. Such ultra-high resolution real time imaging x-ray devices would be highly beneficial because they would enable low-cost imaging with low maintenance and the early detection of various forms of cancer or malignant growths. (Both the latter factors are within NSERC's strategic grant target ""biomedical technologies""). Specifically we need to understand the factors that control the electron and hole lifetimes and how these critica quantities depend on the structure, preparation of the starting material (such as the quench temperature), alloying and dopants. We intent to use the Canadian Light Source at the university to carry out EXAFS and XANES studies of the structure of various doped a-Se alloys to obtain a better understating of their properties. The sponsoring company (Anrad) will provide the photoconductor source materials. Doping and alloying will be done at the U of S where we have extensive experience. We will also fabricate various a-Se photoconductor films as used in the actual detector. Interrupted field time-of-flight transient photoconductivity measurements and temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetric measurements will be used to electrically and thermally characterize the doped a-Se alloys. The synchrotron provides us with an excellent tool, and a unique opportunity, to improve a-Se alloys towards ultra-high resolution imaging.","Materials sciences","University of Saskatchewan",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Science et technologie des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"

"The unlicensed 60-GHz band offers a large seven-gigahertz bandwidth and great interoperability around the world for development of high-data-rate short-range wireless communication systems. However, there are two major obstacles in the way to widespread use of 60 GHz links. First, as these systems have traditionally been implemented in expensive compound semiconductor processes, the high cost of fabrication has prevented the 60 GHz links from being an economical alternative to low-GHz wireless systems. Second problem is the high absorption of material, especially oxygen, at millimeter-wave frequencies, leading to high path loss and making the transmission of 60 GHz signals very difficult. 

To address these problems, we define our research proposal as the design and implementation of fully-integrated low-cost millimeter transceivers in a nanometer CMOS technology. Very recently, aggressive CMOS scaling into the nanometer regime has produced transistors with cutoff frequencies well over 100 GHz, enabling the CMOS technology to be used for implementation of 60-GHz transceivers. The full integration of mm-wave transceivers minimizes the fabrication cost by reducing the dimension of a 60-GHz wireless radio to a few square millimeters as well as eliminating the cost of packaging. Therefore, 60 GHz transceivers can be implemented at the lowest possible cost in CMOS technology.  On the other hand, as CMOS offers highest level of integration of all semiconductor technologies, several transceivers and antennas can be integrated on a single CMOS chip. A multiple-input-multiple-output scheme complemented by a smart antenna array structure can effectively compensate for the path loss of material, making the detection of 60 GHz signal easier than for a single-transceiver single-antenna system. However, there are several challenges  in the design of circuits at frequencies very close to limitation of the technology and implementation of high quality passive devices on lossy silicon substrate. These challenges will be tackled in this research project through discovery of new modeling methods, innovative circuit techniques, and efficient system architectures.

"Many changes in plant metabolism are associated with changes in gene expression. Furthermore many gene products act on more than one substrate. I am fascinated by the integration of these processes. For example, how do small molecules act to regulate gene expression? How does a cell utilize an enzyme for more than one substrate when these substrates may be present at the same time, in differing concentrations? My research on adenosine recycling in plants has led to the realization that adenosine kinase (ADK) is essential for maintaining the hundreds of methylation activities in cells as well as contributing to the interconversion of cytokinins, an important class of plant growth regulators. Our collective results suggest a model of how ADK and other methyl recycling enzymes move to sites of methylation in the cell. The proposed research will test this model by investigating specific protein-protein interactions for ADK's involvement in methyl recycling and cytokinin metabolism. In addition we will investigate the developmental and metabolic effects of inducible over- and under-expression of key enzyme activities participating in these processes. Finally we will integrate the results into a mathematical model of methyl recycling. The proposed experiments will provide new insight into how methylation is maintained in different subcellular compartments and how this is related to cytokinin interconversion in plants.","Advancement of knowledge","University of Waterloo",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Croissance et d�veloppement des v�g�taux","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres"

"We study the ability of plants to defend themselves against pathogens.  In many cases, this disease resistance is conferred by specific disease resistance (R) genes, many of which have been cloned from solanaceous crop plants (potato, tomato, pepper).  However, the molecular analysis of these genes is much easier in model plants such as tobacco.  The generation of such model systems necessitates the ability to generate transgenic plants, which requires specialized sterile environments, including plant tissue culture chambers.  The latter allow for precise control of temperature, light and humidity and are used for the regeneration of transgenic material.  This material is in turn used either to establish experimental systems or to validate candidate genes and proteins for their involvement in plant defences.  The information gleaned from these experimental systems can then be applied to the better use of R genes in their native context in crop plants.

"The need for advanced materials for photonics, signal processing, biological imaging, and sensing has spurred a growing field of research into tuning material properties at the nano-scale. Metallic and semiconductor nanoparticles are exciting candidates as ""building blocks"" for a diverse range of nanostructured materials, due to unique optical and electronic properties that can be tuned as a function of size. For device applications, controlling the spatial organization of nanoparticles is critical, due to collective optical effects that operate on different length scales. In fact, whereas the first 20 years of nanoparticle research was concerned primarily with size-property relations, researchers in recent years have begun to address aspects of nanoparticle organization on multiple length scales. Another challenge for materials scientists has been the incorporation of nanoparticles into polymers, driven by the potential for thin and flexible devices.

Our research program focuses on critical issues of hierarchical organization of metal and semiconductor nanoparticles in polymer systems, both in polymer thin films and polymer colloids. Our strategy utilizes hybrid building blocks consisting of nanoparticles encapsulated inside stable polymeric micelles. We use the polymeric brush layer surrounding each nanoparticle to harness various spontaneous structure-forming processes, resulting in controlled nanoparticle self-assembly on multiple length scales. These bottom-up processes can also be coupled to top-down methodologies such as microcontact printing and microfluidics, in order to exercise external handles on size, structure, and complexity. We also seek to understand the collective optical properties of the resulting polymer-nanoparticle assemblies, and how these properties relate to structure on various length scales. Through the combined development of structure control and determination of structure-property relations in polymer-nanoparticle materials, we will establish methodologies for tuning function toward various applications, including photonic circuit elements, light-emitting photonic crystals, and multifunctional drug-delivery vehicles.","Information, computer and communication technologies","University of Victoria",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Chimie des polym�res","Chimie des polym�res"

"The construction sector contributes significantly to the Canadian economy. It represents about 11% of the national GDP and employs 50% of Canada's apprentices. Shortage of experienced workers is one of the main challenges the construction industry is facing. With an increasing investment in new construction projects, contractors need to respond promptly and efficiently to a rapidly increasing workload while the shortage of skilled workers is intensified. The objective of this research is to maximize utilization of the industry's experienced workforce through developing innovative approaches for organizing production processes and for integrating the use and sharing of knowledge by the workforce.



This proposal focuses mainly on industrial construction processes, a construction sector that deals with building petroleum refineries and oil/gas production facilities, as one of the sectors that face many of the industry's challenges. To achieve the objectives of the research two techniques will be integrated: 1) discrete-event simulation, which is an effective technique for modeling and quantitative evaluation of alternative process workflows and 2) ontology development, a knowledge engineering approach for defining and structuring the concepts used in any information domain in a formal machine readable format. Integrating these techniques will provide a novel and powerful approach to assist industry practitioners optimize the use of knowledge and workforce supply within their companies. Achievement of the proposed objectives will help industrial construction companies maintain a competitive edge in today's global market, which in turn reflects positively on the Canadian economy.

"Soil contamination by heavy metals occurs from abandoned mining waste, landfill leachate, improper treatment of industrial wastes, industrial activities, accidental spills, etc. Common heavy metals contaminants are lead, cadmium, copper, cadmium and mercury. The contamination often affects a large volume of soil and the groundwater resources, posing a significant threat to human health and the environment. Over 2,000 heavy metals contaminated sites have been identified in Canada. Soil contamination by radioactive isotopes can result from nuclear waste, nuclear plant accidents and nuclear weapons. 

Acidic mine tailings is a major source of contamination by heavy metals to surface water and groundwater due to acid mine drainage (AMD). The management and storage of acidic mine tailings is a great challenge for the mining industry. The oxidation of sulphide minerals in mine tailings releases iron and other heavy metals, generating AMD with a pH as low as 2 which facilitates the desorption of adsorbed heavy metals from the soil. The heavy metal contaminants are then transported into soil and water. The Canadian Mining Industry generates 650 million tonnes of waste mine rock per year with a collective liability of 2 to 5 billion dollars. 

Electrochemical remediation (electrokinetic remediation) is a promising technique for in situ decontamination of polluted soils and groundwater. Electrokinetic remediation has also shown promising potential for the dewatering of mine tailings. Electrokinetics can also be applied to enhance desulphurization by froth flotation of acidic mine tailings to prevent AMD. Electrokinetic remediation requires low-level electric current which makes the technique an excellent candidate for solar energy. 

This research program will involve experimental study and numerical analyses to examine and evaluate enhanced electrokinetic remediation of heterogeneous clayey soils contaminated with heavy and radioactive metals. The research will also examine the effectiveness of electrokinetics to enhance the desulphurization and dewatering of reactive mine tailings. Solar panels will be used to provide the direct electric current.

"The development of alternative power sources has become a crucial issue of research and development. Fuel cells appear to be very promising as power supplies for automotive, portable or stationary applications. Making electrode structures �free-standing� (100% binders-free) is challenging but would make them extremely interesting in terms of performance enhancement and even more interesting, since this not only

yields a significant decrease of the cost but also avoid the complicated interferences of the binders and conductivity enhancers. The innermost of this programme is to discover and develop novel �free-standing� 3D-electrode assemblies of unique nanostructure and nanoarchitecture for direct liquid micro fuel cells. The research programme aims to enhance the overall efficiency of the electrode through both novel carbon support materials and unique electrode design and control approaches with freedom synthesis methodologies. To achieve this objective, we will capitalize on our know-how and recent striking achievements in the synthesis of carbon nanostructures directly onto electrically conductive substrates. Nanoparticles catalysts and nanofilm catalysts of various dimensions and morphologies will be synthesized directly onto such carbon nanostructrures supports. The study of such novel nanoarchitectures will involve innovative methods such as the in situ microRaman-Electrochemistry combined with a myriad of structural characterization techniques. Through this characterization we will be able to draw some conclusions and develop correlations which will indicate how different broad categories of nanostructure electrodes and electron transfer mechanisms affect catalyst loading, catalyst activity, catalyst dispersion, catalyst stability, mass transport resistance, and electron transfer rates. The knowledge and understanding gained from this approach will guide the discovery of novel electrode structures offering lower cost, higher electrocatalytic activity, efficiency and durability and by those opening new prospects for DLFCs.

"Recent developments in the global economic environment, including worldwide reductions of trade barriers and regional and multi-country economic zones, have led many Canadian and international companies to start developing their businesses in other countries (such as India, China, and Mexico). In seeking new opportunities abroad, they also face many risks, including uncertain exchange rates, uncertain demands, shorter product life cycles, and variable product prices. For example, fluctuation in foreign exchange rates can create unstable cash flows, and even bankruptcy. The proposed research will employ operations research and financial engineering tools to develop an approach to a global supply chain design that can be used successfully by manufacturing facilities, suppliers, and markets in different countries, while at the same time hedging risks from uncertain demands, stochastic product life cycles, uncertain exchange rates, and variable product prices. Risks can be hedged in two ways: changing operational strategies; and trading financial instruments, so that the company can leverage its resources to yield lower costs and higher revenues. This research will provide effective risk hedging tools and theories, and software for an integrated approach to financial and operational hedging strategies against global risks.  The analysis will provide guidelines for practitioners to establish effective global supply chain strategies that will maximize their profits, and will ultimately provide a series of new opportunities and hedging strategies for their new risks. With the increasing importance of the global supply chain, this study will play a critical role for successful Canadian businesses, increasing their profit gain and while reducing their downside risk.","Production and operations management","Ryerson University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Recherche op�rationnelle et science de la gestion","G�nie industriel"

"This proposal targets to carry-out fundamental research on renewable resource-based bioplastics and their value-added biomaterials, to facilitate rapid transition to a biobased economy. Two recently highlighted bioplastics are polylactides (PLA) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). They are of particular interest because of their renewable origin, biodegradability and claimed environmental sustainability in reducing green house gas emission. There is a pressing need to enhance the versatility of these emerging bioplastics for more wide spread applications, making them ready to compete with traditional non-biodegradable plastics. A transformative approach in creating a new range of smart biomaterials was initiated by incorporation of nanostructures into bioplastic, including revolutionary material combinations. Integrating the advantage of nanotechnology in bringing-out new sustainable biomaterials is considered a gentle approach. Recent accomplishment by the applicant's research team was utilization of a new technology, based on nanoscopic additive, to create a modified bioplastic which exhibits a unique balance in toughness and stiffness. This discovery is imminent to further explore the science-based knowledge economy for multifunctional bioplastic uses. The science and engineering principles of new bioplastic matrices will be expanded further, using additional reinforcements, such as nano-clay, natural fibres and talc to generate new smart biomaterials. Such materials are called hierarchical nano-biocomposites. The value-added biomaterials from new discovered bioplastics will have applications in greener auto-arts, building products, furniture and rigid packaging. This will not only help in providing additional uses and new markets for agriculture and manufacturing industry, but will also supplement and substitute the existing petroleum-based counterparts. This means a tremendous reduction in green house gas emission through use of biomaterials and reducing our dependency on petroleum. The out-come of this research will create new fundamental knowledge to stimulate additional research. The vision is to educate future students in driving-forward the emerging green technology innovation.

"Gerber beams introduce internal hinges in continuous beam to make them statically determinate. The final system is thus is not affected by settlements, thermal effects, etc. The Gerber system consists of a series of simply supported beams extended at their ends by cantilevers in alternate spans and linked by intermediate beams supported on the cantilever ends. The beams are often supported on columns with a square HSS cross-section and less commonly on wide flange columns. The spans of the cantilever can be optimized to ensure that the maximum negative bending moments at column location is nearly equal to the maximum positive moment at mid-span. Frequently, the top flanges of Gerber beams are connected to the top chord of open web steel joists (OWSJ) which are normally connected to a light gage steel deck. 

The Gerber beam system is a common construction method in Canadian warehouses and strip malls. To date, in order to reliably determine the buckling resistance of these systems, engineers have to resort to finite element analysis. Within this context, the proposed research aims at developing simplified design rules for these systems which realistically account for the lateral and torsional restraints provided by Open Web Steel Joists and various bracing methods. The proposed study involves experimental and numerical components in order to calibrate the numerical model. The calibrated model will then be used to conduct a parametric study and provide simplified design rules and recommendations for Gerber beam systems.","Structural engineering","University of Ottawa",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Structures en acier","G�nie des structures"

"Since 1995, I have held a Discovery Grant supporting a research program focused mainly on microbial catabolism of terpenoids. This diverse family of chemicals, including steroids, is abundantly produced in the natural world and has important biological effects and ecological consequences. This research program has been highly productive and made well-recognized contributions to knowledge of microbial metabolism and ecology. The program has also been the springboard for numerous individually-funded and successful projects. This proposal describes fundamental research on the soil bacterium, Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, investigating steroid catabolism and responses to environmental stresses. Objectives of the research are to (a) characterize uptake systems for the steroids, cholesterol and cholic acid, (b) elucidate the pathway for cholic acid catabolism, including responsible reactions, enzymes and genes, (c) determine mechanisms for tolerance of desiccation, osmotic stress and anoxia and (d) elucidate genetic regulatory networks controlling responses to those stresses. Primary research approaches include (a) use of a microarray to monitor expression of over 8,000 RHA1 genes, (b) deletion mutagenesis to determine gene functions, (c) expression of proteins to determine their functions and (d) measurements of steroid uptake and enzymatic activities. This research will be important, as it will contribute important new understanding of key aspects of the metabolism, physiology and ecology of Actinobacteria, a group with critical roles in the recycling of organic matter in soil. The research will also facilitate applications involving Actinobacteria or their enzymes, for drug synthesis, other industrial biotransformations (green chemistry) and bioremediation of polluted environments.","Human pharmaceuticals","University of British Columbia",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Bact�riologie",Microbiologie

"The dairy sector is a significant part of our heritage and of the Canadian agriculture. The dairy industry is the fourth largest sector of the Canadian agri-food economy. In 2007, dairy farming generated $4.8 billion in total farm cash receipts, and sales from Canadian dairy processors amounted to $13 billion, accounting for 16.8% of all processing sales in the Canadian food and beverage sector. In 2007, there were approximately 38,000 people working on 14,660 Canadian dairy farms, and roughly 26,000 other workers are employed in 450 Canadian dairy plants. More than 450 fine and traditional cheeses are produced in various regions of the country. According to Canadian Dairy Commission, 14.1% of the milk produced in our country is now used to make cheddar cheese. In 2007, Canadian cheddar cheese production reached 145,002 tons, an increase of 4.1%   from 2006 and 14.7% from 2004. In Canada, the per capita consumption of cheddar cheese was 4.14 kg in 2006, an increase of 4.3% from 2005 and 9.5% from 2004. Canadian milk and dairy products are also recognized internationally for their superior quality. However, our dairy industry is facing intense competitions on the national and international markets and must deliver high-quality and novel products. The industrial manufacture of cheese requires the inoculation of 10 millions (10e7) of carefully selected bacterial cells (known as starter cultures) per ml of pasteurized milk in order to properly control the fermentation. The starter culture is a combination of microorganisms from the group called Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) of which Lactococcus lactis is the most important species, particularly for the production of cheddar cheese. Considering that an inoculum of 10e14 bacterial cells is needed to produce 1 ton of cheese, it is obvious that LAB are of considerable interest to the Canadian cheese industry. The use of a performing starter culture is critical to obtain high-quality products. The aim of this project is to provide novel tools and knowledge to the dairy industry to improve their starter cultures.","Processed food products and beverages","Universit� Laval",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Virologie,Microbiologie
"The dairy industry is a significant part of our heritage and of our economy. It is the fourth largest sector of the Canadian agri-food economy. In 2007, dairy farming generated receipts of $5.2 billion and sales from dairy processors amounted to $11.6 billion, accounting for 15% of all processing sales in the Canadian food and beverage sector. Over 38,000 Canadians are working on 14,660 dairy farms, and over 22,000 others are employed in 445 dairy plants. This makes the dairy sector the second largest employer in the food industry. More than 450 cheeses are now produced in our country. In 2007, Canadian cheeses were produced at a record level, reaching 403,828 tons, an increase of 4.4% from 2006. Similarly, yogurt production reached an all-time high of 251,672 tons, an increase of 3.3% from 2006. There is no indication that this trend will change soon. However, our dairy industry is facing intense competitions on the national and international markets and must deliver high-quality products. The industrial manufacture of cheese and yogurt requires the inoculation of milk with carefully selected bacterial cells (known as starter culture) in order to control the fermentation and to obtain quality products. The starter culture is a combination of bacteria, of which Streptococcus thermophilus is one of the most important species. Performing starter cultures are critical to obtain high-quality products.

It is well documented that increased productivity within existing facilities will lead to milk fermentation failures due to bacterial viruses, namely bacteriophages, that destroy the starter cultures. This natural phenomenon leads to low quality products and economic losses. Due to their extensive growth, some yogurt and cheese plants are going through phage problems with their S. thermophilus strains. The aim of this research program is to acquire basic knowledge on these bacteriophages for the development of phage-resistant S. thermophilus strains. This research may give our dairy industry better S. thermophilus strains and therefore, a competitive edge. The anti-phage strategies will also be applicable to other bacterial strains susceptible to phage attack in industrial fermentations.

"This MRS grant proposal is to cover the operating and maintenance costs of the ""F�lix d'H�relle Reference Center for Bacterial Viruses"". Bacterial viruses or bacteriophages only infect and kill bacteria. Phages are the most abundant organisms in the biosphere and play major roles in the ecological balance of microbial life. The mission of the F�lix d'H�relle Center (www.phage.ulaval.ca) is to collect, conserve and distribute reference bacteriophages and information about them to foster research and education. The collection serves as repository for key phages of historical, geographical, taxonomic, agricultural, medical, veterinary or industrial significance. As of September 2006, the F�lix d'H�relle Center contains 450 reference phages and 384 bacterial hosts representing 64 bacterial genera and 120 species. It is the largest public collection of characterized phages in the world. 



Several researchers from many universities, government laboratories and companies use biological specimens from the F�lix d'H�relle Center. In the last four years, 623 phages and bacteria were requested from the collection for an average of three microorganisms per week. These requests came from over 120 laboratories located in 18 countries that are working on various aspects of phage research. This is a clear indication of the international recognition of the F�lix d'H�relle Center. Moreover, 33% of the phages were requested by Canadian researchers confirming the importance of the collection to R & D projects in our country.



The F�lix d'H�relle Center was founded in 1982 by the dedicated efforts of Hans-W. Ackermann M.D., a professor of medical microbiology at the U. Laval. He maintained the activities of the Center until his retirement in December 2002. As of January 2003, the new curator is Sylvain Moineau Ph.D., professor at the Department of Biochemistry & Microbiology at U. Laval.

"Prolyl Oligopeptidase (POP) inhibition is a highly promising strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and POP inhibitors as drug candidates are to be developed. Moitessier and co-workers have recently reported a potent, permeant and highly selective POP inhibitor. However, its stability and pharmacokinetic profile need to be improved. A large number of drug discovery and development projects fail at the late development stages due to poor pharmacokinetic profiles. Integrating the evaluation of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADME-Tox) of potential candidate drugs early in the drug discovery process is expected to significantly reduce this failure rate. IIi this context, predicting the ADME-Tox profile using computational methods has been seen as a high-throughput and inexpensive option that could complement low to medium throughput in vitro or in vivo assays. Moitessier and co-workers have developed a sophisticated platform of programs (FORECASTER) which performs virtual screening, docking and more (www.fitted.ca). In this research, we plan to combine our complementary expertise in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, metabolism and software development to 1. develop accurate in silico methods that predict the cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism and P450 inhibition and implement them in our platform FORECASTER; 2. apply this suite of programs to the development of improved POP inhibitors.

This research will provide a computational alternative to the low throughput metabolism assays for the Canadian Pharmaceutical Industry. It will also identify novel molecules as potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease based on this target. The collaboration with AstraZeneca will provide the PI with the knowledge in metabolism essential to the development of an accurate computational tool and enable realistic application of the developed platform (FORECASTER) to medicinal chemistry as carried out in the pharmaceutical industry. This multidisciplinary program will also enable the training of students and fellows who will acquire skills in the highly-valued areas of computer-aided drug design, multistep organic synthesis, and medicinal chemistry.","Human pharmaceuticals","McGill University",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Sciences de la vie li�es � la sant� publique et aux maladies humaines","Sciences de la vie li�es � la sant� publique et aux maladies humaines"
"Molecular discovery is often a long, inefficient and expensive process. Our research integrates organic, computational, and medicinal chemistry in order to increase the output rate in both synthetic catalysis and drug discovery. ACE 1.0 (Asymmetric Catalyst Evaluation) and FITTED 2.2 (Flexibility Induced Through Targeted Evolutionary Description) have been developed to identify asymmetric catalysts and enzyme inhibitors respectively. Continuing this trend this proposal presents improvements of the molecular mechanics-based program ACE currently funded by NSERC and its application to the design and synthesis of a variety of carbohydrate-based bifunctional catalysts. ACE, which is the only independent software of its kind, quickly and accurately predicts the stereoselectivity of asymmetric reactions. Although this program is accurate on two modeled reactions, improvements are necessary to make it more versatile and more user-friendly for organic chemists such as implementation/evaluation of implicit solvent models, development of force field transition metal parameters accounting for various geometries of specific metals and modeling of the Boltzmann population. Other optimizations are also proposed and will convert ACE into a virtual screening tool and a de novo optimization tool. We will also modify ACE to use ChemDraw files as input. 

In parallel, application of ACE 1.0 to the design of carbohydrate-based catalysts is ongoing and will continue for the coming years. Given the number and variety available, carbohydrates allow sufficient flexibility for finely tuning the geometric and electronic properties of catalysts. In the context of virtual screening, this is an asset. Applications to other asymmetric reactions will be presented in this proposal and will take advantage of the numerous oxygen atoms of the carbohydrate synthons to bind metals and/or Lewis acids. A third part of this proposal describes the development and application of a novel program to design enzymes for biocatalysis. This new program will be developed from ACE, which has the ability to model transition states from reactants and organic reactions, and FITTED, which optimizes ligand/protein complexes with additional modifications.

"The main part of my research proposal involves statistical classification in the presence of missing data. Statistical classification has long been used as a major decision making procedure in almost all areas of physical, biological, and social sciences. It is about predicting a characteristic of interest associated with an entity based on the entity's other features. The characteristic of interest, which is usually called the class membership, is always a categorical/discrete quantity such as healthy or ill, correct or incorrect, low or medium or high, 0 or 1, etc. The feature set is typically a finite collection of numerical values.  A simple example is the case where a person is to be classified as having a certain type of illness, based on measurements such as heart-beats, blood pressure, age, etc. The problem is then to find a classifier (a function) that can predict the class membership of a person, based on its corresponding feature set, as best as possible; here ""best"" means having the lowest possible misclassification error rate.



Another part of my research proposal deals with the problem of curve estimation in the presence of missing data.  Here, a curve may be the underlying true distribution of the data or perhaps a regression curve. These curves have extensive applications in the field of statistical inference.



Since, in practice, many real data sets have missing values, one needs to have modified procedures that can deal with missing data in an effective way. I strongly believe that my results are very useful and applicable in the general area of Statistical Sciences, and can provide powerful tools to various Canadian research (statistical) communities.

"Graph theory is a fascinating and important pure mathematical field which, with the advent of the computer age, gained a new importance because of its applied aspects. Many of the problems that arise in computer science are best modelled by graphs.  For example, massive networks are  massive graphs and the problem of finding good schedules is what is known as a graph colouring problem.  Thus, over the past few decades, the use of graph theory to study computing has grown immensely.



One of the most important modern trends in graph theory is the use of tools and concepts from probability theory.  The probabilistic method is a powerful and elegant tool for proving theorems.  Also, the use of random choices in algorithms has led to the development of much simpler and more efficient methods for many important problems.  When studying the behaviour of an algorithm, we often ask how it performs on an average input, which amounts to analyzing its behaviour on a random input.  This has led to a whole new need for the study of random graphs - a mathematical field that was introduced by Erdos and Renyi in the 1950's, long before its importance to computer science was realized.  More recently, random structures have been recognized as a vast source for difficult inputs that can be used for the testing and refinement of algorithms.



My research program encompasses many aspects of graph theory and related fields, and their role in theoretical computer science.  Much of my work concentrates on the areas which involve probability.

"We are proposing a whole-lake sodium sulfate addition to a fishless, remote lake in the Experimental Lakes Area in Northwestern Ontario - artificially eutrophic Lake 227 which has received only phosphorus since 1990 to study several major questions related to eutrophication management, mercury bioaccumulation and road salt impacts. We hypothesize that varying sulfate levels in eutrophic lakes across Canada accounts for much of the chemical and biological variation in lake responses. The experiment will examine (1) the extent to which sulfate regulates internal phosphorus and iron loading from lake sediments which in turn, (2) control formation of nuisance cyanobacteria blooms, and (3) the extent to which sulfate regulates methylmercury formation rates. (4) This experiment requires a sodium chloride (i.e., road salt) control and thus one experiment will investigate four environmental problems. 

Our goal is to manipulate internal loading of iron and phosphorus from bottom sediments by adding sodium sulfate to increase microbial sulfide production rates in its anaerobic sediments. The rationale for this intervention is based on our current understanding of how a lake's internal nutrient dynamics are affected under under low and high sulfate levels. We argue that adding high levels of sulfate will (i) increase internal phosphorus loading, (ii) reduce internal loading of ferrous iron, (iii) decrease the relative abundance of the cyanobacteria which normally reach 100% by mid June, to a very low level by starving them of ferrous iron at high sulfate levels - in spite of increased whole-lake P levels, (iv) decrease cyanotoxin levels and cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation and hence decrease biologically available nitrogen in the lake. (v) We also hypothesize that high levels of sulfate addition will increase formation of methylmercury (a toxic form of mercury) and affect the potential for mercury bioaccumulation. The study builds on an earlier study on Lake 227 which showed that cyanobacterial bloom formation could be prevented by suppressing access to ferrous",Environment,"York University",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","�cologie aquatique et limnologie","�volution et �cologie"
"Globally, lake sediments store a very large amount of carbon. The presence of algal remains in sediments such as pigments, cell walls, etc indicates that sediment carbon is partially derived from algae.  However, evidence shows that algal carbon is readily mineralized by the microbial community so it appears that there must be a major non-biological source of sediment carbon. During the last grant cycle, work in my laboratory demonstrated that irradiation of acidic stream waters with artificial sunlight resulted in formation of particulate organic carbon (POC) from dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and that formation of particulate iron played a major role, probably because DOC adheres to the surface of newly formed particulate iron. We hypothesize that this mechanism plays a major role in transferring DOC to sediments. The first part of this proposal seeks to extend this work by examining the extent of POC formation in acidic and non-acidic waters in the absence of UVB.



In the second part of this proposal, I propose to examine the relationship between the production of 'labile' iron in freshwaters and the algal species that dominate phytoplankton communities. Benign eukaryotic species typically co-exist with very small cyanobacteria in nutrient-poor oligotrophic lakes where productivity is usually by low levels of phosphorus. Nutrient-rich eutrophic waters are typically dominated by large cyanobacteria. It is not clear how more benign eucaryotic species are displaced by toxic cyanobacteria. I developed a conceptual model in which the ratio of labile iron supply rate to phosphate supply rate is critical in determining the relative abundance of cyanobacteria. The primary goal of my proposed research is to compare supply rates of phosphate and labile iron using a method that captures labile iron and phosphate over a 24 hour period to algal species composition. This will help determine whether variation in the phosphorus/iron supply ratio affects the composition of the algal community.

"Canada has some of the world's most abundant groundwater resources which are critical for drinking water and industrial use, and for maintaining ecosystems and stream flow. These resources are being threatened by over-exploitation, contamination and climate change. Some of the most complex and vulnerable groundwater systems are found within fractured porous media, for example fractured sedimentary rock, and within the Canadian Shield. These environments are particularly challenging to characterize and remediate. 

This Discovery Grant, entitled ""Simulation Tools for Protection and Remediation of Groundwater in Fractured Rock"", will contribute towards developing new conceptual models and computational approaches to better understand these groundwater resources, thus improving our ability to remediate contaminated sites and prevent future impacts. In particular, two primary research themes are envisioned; 1: Thermal and reactive contaminant mass transport, and 2: Protection of groundwater resources in fractured rock aquifers. In Theme 1, advanced numerical models will be developed and applied to simulate thermal tracers for identifying flow within active fractures, and to design and assess novel approaches for enhanced bio-remediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated groundwater. In Theme 2, computational modelling strategies will be developed for identifying capture zones within fracture bedrock aquifers. The outcomes will include new quantitative prediction tools for assessing the efficiency of remediation methods applied to contaminated bedrock aquifers, and for delineating wellhead protection zones surrounding vulnerable bedrock water supply wells. These tools, insights and methodologies will be valuable to consultants and municipal governments responsible for groundwater supply and protection.

The Discovery Grant funds will help support 1 PhD. and 2 MSc. students for their research, travel and publication costs. The students' research will be closely linked with the Canada Research Chair in Quantitative Hydrogeology of Fractured Porous Media.

"Molecules at very cold temperatures are expected to behave quite differently from those at high temperatures.  For example, a significant enhancement of reaction cross section is expected for some systems below 10 K because of the tunneling process, resonance effect and its large thermal deBroglie length.  However, little is known about the intrinsic properties of cold molecules because of the difficulty in making free cold molecules.  My research project explores the physical and chemical properties of molecules at very low temperatures by laser spectroscopy, and consists of four topics.

1) Spectroscopic investigation of molecules in quantum condensed phases 

2) Development of techniques for making free cold molecules 

3) Coherent control of cold molecules by laser fields and applications to quantum computing 

4) Astronomical observation of molecules in interstellar space and related laboratory spectroscopy

Through the above studies, new phenomena intrinsic to cold molecules can be observed such as quantum tunneling effects and the wave nature of molecules.  If one could achieve trapping of molecules at ultra-cold temperatures, it would be possible to control the number of molecules coherently, which would lead to a new methodology to manipulate molecules through quantum mechanics.  In addition, there are many other applications of cold molecules such as proving the nonzero electric dipole moment of an electron, and observation of small energy differences in chiral molecules, etc.    Studies of molecules at very low temperatures open unlimited possibilities, in terms of not only basic natural sciences, but also practical applications,   which offer a completely new field of research in physical chemistry.

"A classic aphorism  characterising the difference between weather and climate states that ""climate is what you expect, but weather is what you get"".  This conception is fundamentally probabilistic: the evolution of weather from day to day is seen as the particular path of a turbulent system, while the climate is the probability distribution of all these possible weather paths. Understanding and  predicting the climate system involves studying not just the average state, but the strength of variability about the average, asymmetries in this variability, the nature of extreme events, and so  forth.  The fundamental object of interest is the probability distribution of the climate system. 



This research looks at the connections between weather and climate, focusing on the broad goals of (1)  characterising the  probability distributions of important climate variables, (2)  developing physically-based models to understand the origin of these distributions, and  (3) assessing the influence of small-scale (in space and time) ""weather"" variability on the dynamics  of the large-scale ""climate"" system.  Particular questions to be asked include: ""what is the physical origin of observed large-scale forms of atmospheric variability?"", ""what role does 'ocean weather' play in making coastal waters more acidic and oxygen-poor?"", and ""what are the physical processes that control variability in sea-surface winds, and how are these related to processes in the upper ocean?"".  These problems are of significance for the improvement of operational weather and climate models, and will bring together mathematicians and climate scientists to address issues of fundamental importance to Canada and to the broader global community.","Climate and atmosphere","University of Victoria",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","�tude de l'atmosph�re","�tude de l'atmosph�re"
"This research proposal has two objectives.  The first objective is to determine and compare the diversity and community structure of fungi in soil, litter, and wood debris in four different but adjacent forest types in southern Ontario with the use of massive parallel pyrosequencing. Forest types will include three ectotrophic (scots pine, hemlock, and old growth hardwood) and one non-ectotrophic (sugar maple) stands. We predict that below ground fungal communities will be more similar among ectotrophic stands, while above ground fungal communities will be more similar with respect to wood and litter type (softwood vs. hardwood). Another hypothesis to be tested is that massive DNA sampling of environmental fungi will recover a much higher fungal:plant ratio than the average  6:1 ratio reported by Hawksworth (1991) from traditional fungal sampling methods.  If this hypothesis proves correct, then fungal diversity worldwide could be much higher than the predicted 1.5 million. The second objective of this study is to assess the biogeographic relationships of selected eastern Canadian macrofungi of ecological and/or economic importance and to reevaluate their taxonomy.  These fungi belong to the ectomycorrhizal genera Amanita, Laccaria, Cantharellus, and Hydnum and the saprobes genera Xerula, Xeromphalina, Pleurotus and Ganoderma. These taxa are chosen because they are commonly found in northern hemisphere temperate forests yet are still taxonomically problematic. We predict that eastern Canadian macrofungi will, in general, be more closely related to species found southward in the Appalaches than they are to western America and European species, thus favoring the hypothesis of post-glacial recolonization from more southern refugees.  This would also invalidate the application of European names for many eastern North American taxa as they have largely been applied in the past.","Advancement of knowledge","University of Toronto",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","�volution et �cologie","�volution et �cologie"
"A new form of electronics called spintronics exploits a quantum mechanical property of the electron called spin.  Electron spin is analogous to a spinning top, which can rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise.  Likewise, an electron's spin can either point up or down.  The idea of spintronics is to use the up and down electrons as two binary states for information storage.  The virtue of using electron spins to store information is that in ferromagnetic materials no power is required to maintain the direction of the spins inside the material.  This is in contrast to conventional electronics, which stores information by accumulating charge on transistors that quickly leaks away if the power is turned off.  If a computer's random access memory were made of spintronic components, there would be no need to reboot the computer after a power failure because the electron spins would retain all the information.  Since no power is required to keep the information in memory, spintronic devices would consume much less power, which is particularly important for portable electronic devices.

Current spintronic devices can be found in the read head of every hard drive that is manufactured today.  However, to fully exploit the potential of spintronics, the new technology will have to be incorporated into the microchip.  One approach to integrating spintronic materials with semiconductors is to make semiconductors ferromagnetic by doping them with magnetic impurities.  Ferromagnetism has been discovered in Mn doped GaAs and Ge.  Unfortunately, they are magnetic only at temperatures far below room temperature.  The goal of the work is to better understand the physics behind ferromagnetic semiconductors in order to assist in finding ways of increasing their working temperature.  This research will investigate novel spintronic materials that are compatible with Si technology by incorporating magnetic elements into Si and Ge structures.  The materials will be used to study how spins cross the interfaces in heterostructures.

"Which factors influence our perception of, and response to, sounds?  Do previous experiences with similar sounds influence the way in which we respond to new sounds?  Can we pay attention to one sound while at the same time ignoring others? Can we attend to any specific feature of a sound such as its pitch or location or must we pay attend to 'whole' sounds? My research program is designed to answer these deceptively simple questions and, in so doing, to develop a complete understanding of the operation of auditory selective attention. In working toward this ultimate goal, my students and I often study how the perception of a specific sound may be enhanced or compromised depending on the context in which it is presented. We have found that perception of a target sound is often affected by its local (in basic features such as location, frequency, intensity, & timbre) and global (consistency with a pattern) similarity to any other sounds which precede or follow it, and by the listener's expectations. Experiments such as these provide insights into the interaction of attentional mechanisms with processes involved in perceptual organization and memory.

"A new cooling technology known as thermoacoustic cooling will be investigated as part of the proposed research program.  Thermoacoustic cooling is a ""green"" alternative to conventional vapor compression cooling cycles commonly used in refrigerators and air-conditioners.  Thermoacoustic cycles require no refrigerants such as CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) or HCFCs (Hydrochlorofluorocarbons) that may cause ozone layer destruction or global warming.  Cooling energy is produced from high amplitude sound waves generated using an electro-dynamic transducer tuned to operate near resonance.  Acoustic waves in a pressurized vessel filled with a gas mixture of helium and argon are converted into cooling energy through thermal relaxations of the gas within a porous substrate.



The goal of the proposed research program is to better understand and further develop thermoacoustic cooling technologies.  As part of the plan, one thermoacoustic cooler prototype will be developed.  It will be used to verify predictions from theoretical models, to demonstrate the technology, and as a test bed for various components.  Investigations will be performed to characterize and understand streaming effects, considered one of the factors that hamper the efficiency of thermoacoustic devices.  Novel methods to measure the thermal energy flow and heat transfer mechanisms between the oscillating gas and the heat exchanger will be developed.  The findings will help identify performance bottle necks, and should lead to improved efficiency.

"The general context is the mechanical failure of vascular conduits (plaque and aneurysm rupture) and their treatment with vascular prostheses (stents, grafts, heart valves). For example, it is now considered that one of the main causes of myocardial infarction is the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. The use of a stent (endovascular scaffolding prosthesis) is a well established interventional method to treat atherosclerotic arteries. However, in a significant fraction (20%-30%), the stented segment may reobstruct. This phenomenon called in-stent restenosis (ISR) is principally caused by the proliferation of smooth muscle cells (hyperplasia). It has been proposed that possible causes of ISR are wall injury of mechanical origin during angioplasty. The proposed approach using fracture mechanics should help understand these phenomena. 



In the course of this project, a combination of computer and experimental work will be elaborated to study the fracture of the vascular wall and stent. For the numerical models, we will use structural analysis software packages (Ansys combined with Zencrack, a crack dedicated code). These dedicated codes have the capacity to simulate crack initiation and growth in realistic three-dimensional structures. In conjunction with fatigue models, it will provide a means to estimate the life expectancy of a given plaque as well as the possibility to study internal wall injuries during angioplasty. The parameters required to carry out this modeling include: the viscoelasticity of vascular tissues, that will be measured with our mechanical testers. Another parameter, the tissue fracture toughness (resistance to tear) will be determined using standard trouser and scissor tests. Concerning the characterization of the microstructure of the vascular tissue, we initiated 3D reconstructions of collagen fibers using multi-photon imaging. This information will to be integrated in an anisotropic model. The resulting overall numerical model will be used to investigate the impact of stent designs for their optimization.

"Sleep is essential to life in higher organisms. According to current models, sleep is orchestrated by two mechanisms: circadian and homeostatic processes. In mammals, the circadian process originates from the main biological clock in the brain and generates an about 24-h rhythm in physiological functions (body temperature, alertness). The homeostatic process is an hourglass mechanism that regulates sleep intensity according to the duration and quality of prior wakefulness. Its nature has not been clearly defined and the way the processes interact is also unknown. However, recent work supports the involvement of synapses, the functional unit of communication between neuronal cells, in sleep regulation. Synaptic adhesion molecules hold the two sides of the synapse together but, more importantly, these proteins control the strength of the communication between neurons. In this project, the contribution of adhesion systems to sleep regulation will be investigated. First, the markers of the homeostatic process (i.e. brain electrical activity and gene expression) will be evaluated using sleep deprivation in mice where specific synaptic molecules are downregulated using RNA interference. To do so, the acquisition of a sleep monitoring system for simultaneous recording of 8 mice is required. Second, the properties of the circadian timing system (e.g. the length of the endogenous period and the phase-shift response to light stimulus) will be evaluated using temperature and activity recording in mice in which synaptic molecules are downregulated using RNA interference as well. This aim will be accomplish via the acquisition of a telemetry system for continuous recording of temperature and activity in mice. The results of the project will advance our understanding of sleep physiology and neuronal functions, and assist in the development of treatments and interventions for patients suffering from disorders involving disturbance in sleep regulatory processes, including age-related changes and insomnia. Accordingly, funds are requested for the purchase of the required sleep and telemetry monitoring systems to perform the research.

"Security and reliability of computer systems has taken a new significance with the development of the Internet and more generally with the use of computers in all parts of our lives.  The recent success of Java despite its relative slowness and its use of a memory management technique reputed inefficient (a garbage collector), shows how much the focus has shifted away from performance to robustness and ease of development.

A large part of the robustness of Java can be attributed directly to the use of strong static typing, which is by far the most popular formal method in use today in software development.  Yet, there are still many cases where Java's type system is not good enough, either because is is too strong and prevents the programmer from writing the code he wants, or on the contrary because it is too weak to express the desired correctness property.

You can still verify mechanically the correctness property of interest, using tools such as: extended static checking, model checking, full proof in Hoare logic.  But the switch from using just type annotations to developing a model or even a whole correctness proof is a very big step which requires a lot of work and expertise.  The benefit is thus rarely considered worth the effort, leaving such techniques to niches.

My research program aims to take another approach based on making the type system more powerful, so that arbitrary properties can be expressed and verified with it, making it possible to seamlessly cover the range from traditional simple type annotations to arbitrarily more complex correctness properties.  This will make it easier to write and maintain robust software, where the robustness is mechanically verified.

Formal methods have revolutionized the way hardware is designed, and the world of computer software is going through a similar transformation; leading it can bring large strategic benefits to the software industry in Canada.  Another way to evaluate the impact of such a development is to look at the current vulnerability of our society as a whole to very simple computer viruses.  Formally verifying every program is becoming a necessity, just as much as verifying the soundness of the construction plans of every bridge.

"Cancer chemopreventive activity of cruciferous vegetables (Brassicaceae family, such as broccoli and cabbage) is believed to be due to glucosinolates (GLs), their enzymatic derived products (i.e. isothiocyanates), flavonoids and other phenolic compounds. Most of these encouraging studies have been performed on compounds found in cruciferous vegetables from the Brassica species. It is thus of great importance to examine the pharmacological value of the products of ""non-Brassica"" GL-containing plants. Our research is focused on the studies of intact GLs, their hydrolysis products, flavonoids, alkaloids and other secondary metabolites from ""non-Brassica"" wild plants from the Brassicaceae family for potential cancer chemoprotection or antioxidant properties. The studies will be performed on two wild endemic plants of North America because such plants are a valuable source of new metabolites. The first one is toothwort which is a native forest plant found in eastern Canada and the United States; it is used for food and in traditional Native American medicine as a febrifuge. The second one, called spectacle pod, is an endemic annual plant found in Colorado, Utah, Arizona and northern Mexico, used by some Native Indian tribes as a dermatological aid and febrifuge. Once the structure elucidation of the isolated phytochemicals in toothwort roots and in spectacle pod fruits will be determined, in vitro bioassays will be performed to confirm the potential of the new molecules to act as cancer chemopreventive and antioxidant agents. Furthermore, we wish to extend our studies on a chemical screening of wild endemic crucifers from Canada especially from the Arctic area using a Liquid chromatograph-Mass spectrometer to probe for potential new cancer chemopreventive products and antioxidants. Identification and bioassay of the enzymatic hydrolysis products using myrosinase of the isolated GLs or thermal breakdown products could be investigated and show a potential in cancer chemoprevention. A fresh avenue to study these plants as nutraceuticals is possible as well as their potential to develop a lead compound of commercial interest to pharmaceutical and food companies.","Human pharmaceuticals","Laurentian University of Sudbury",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Produits naturels","Chimie organique"
"Carbohydrates are a major component of bacteria, plants and mammalian cells.  Our research program focuses on the fine structural characterization and functional role of such complex carbohydrates, and in the use of these organism-specific carbohydrates in drug and vaccine preparations.  The majority of our attention is directed at deciphering the complex polysaccharide structures expressed by infectious bacteria by using chemical methods and analytical techniques, such as, mass-spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  We are interested in pursuing the study of medically important bacteria, for example, the recently discovered Alloiococcus otitidis, which is responsible for middle-ear infections in humans. We are also engaged in studying the chemical structures and immunochemical properties of metabolites and polysaccharides from health-related plants, such as, St. John's Wort, and of mammalian cells involved in embryogenesis.  It is now well accepted that polysaccharides are capable of eliciting the immune system to raise polysaccharide-specific antibodies and in enhancing the immune systems' defensive mechanism as a whole.  Hence, one of our ultimate research objectives is aimed at employing these novel structurally-defined carbohydrates as protective antigens in prophylactic glycoconjugate vaccines and therapeutic drugs.

"Oceanic seabirds are the most wide-ranging animals on earth. They are top predators that spend most of their lives at sea. Moving over both regional and very large ocean scales, seabirds sample a wide swath of ocean habitat and are excellent bio-indicators for the health and status of marine ecosystems. Their associations with ocean features can be hugely informative about ecosystem processes in remote marine habitats where biological research is difficult.This knowledge is critical for developing better understanding, protection and management of marine animals and ecosystems in the face of rapid and profound change.

  Trans-equatorial migrant seabirds breed in one hemisphere and migrate to and winter in another, exhibiting the greatest use of whole ocean habitat. During summer the seabird community of eastern Canada is dominated by migrant shearwaters that breed in the Southern Hemisphere. 

   The proposed research wil investigate how Southern Hemisphere shearwaters move about and use ocean habitat in Atlantic Canada. To do this, small bird-borne satellite tags will be attached to shearwaters captured in the coastal waters of Newfoundland. The birds will be tracked to determine areas of occupancy and habitat use in eastern Canadian waters. This research will also determine their movement chronology in the region and the timing and routes of their return migration to breeding colonies in the South Atlantic Ocean and how marine weather systems affect their movments. These studies will inform us about areas of aggreagation [ocean ""hotspots""], migration ecology and population connections over regional and ocean-basin scales. 

   Knowledge of how seabirds move and exploit resources throughout the ocean will aid in understanding their habitat requirements and their responses to ocean climate change. This research is valuable for Canada because it will lead to comprehensive understanding of how marine animal use jurisdictional waters and hence how to protect them and the ecosystems that they and we depend on.

"Recent technical advances have revolutionized our capability to investigate basic questions in animal behaviour that were previously beyond scientific scrutiny. Miniaturized data storage tags that record location using satellites, as well as temperature, pressure and light level, can be attached to free-ranging seabirds to investigate how they move throughout and use resources and habitats in the world's oceans. This proposal builds on an ecosystem research program and seeks to apply this new technology to explore the year-round foraging and migratory behaviour and ecology of eastern Canadian seabirds. Studies engage a suite of seabirds (shearwaters, auks, gannets) that span a range of body and population sizes and foraging behaviours and that feed on crustaceans, squid and fish at various depths in different ocean regions. Studies will explore how changing environmental conditions influence the seabirds' behavioural tactics and how they contend with seasonal changes. Intra- and inter-annual studies will compare the small (bay-scale foraging) and large (ocean-scale migration) scale movements and behaviour of individual seabirds. Linkages with the ecosystems in which seabirds are embedded will be maximized by integrating these studies with colony and vessel-based research. Colony studies document chick diets and success, and vessel studies map avian and fish distributions and their environmental associations, providing rationale for behaviour at sea. Habitat use and trophic interactions at the bay and ocean scales will be determined by integrating seabird movements and water temperatures in foraging locations with environmental information obtained from vessels and satellites and with biochemical analyses. Changes in foraging and migration activities will be used to evaluate how environmental conditions modulate behavioural flexibility and persistence at the individual level. This understanding is essential because these behavioural responses among socially foraging and breeding marine birds provide the mechanisms that culminate in the emergence of population patterns.","Advancement of knowledge","Memorial University of Newfoundland",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","�cologie animale","�volution et �cologie"
"More than  130 years ago, Charles Darwin suggested that some plant and animal features might help individuals to obtain mates, even though those traits were detrimental to survival. Such 'sexually selected' traits, he said, are thus very different from survival traits that resulted from natural selection. Even though this was a major scientific discovery, it was largely ignored for more than a century for both sociological and scientific reasons. The past 30 years, though, has seen a major resurgence of interest in sexual selection due to the development of both sophisticated theories that make a variety of interesting predictions and new experimental, molecular and observational techniques that allow us to thoroughly test those theories. My research focuses on both precopulatory (mate attraction) and postcopulatory (fertilization) characteristics of animals to test and develop theory that will help us to better explain the diversity of animals that have evolved as a result of sexual selection. Our current research addresses two general questions: (1) Why is there so much variation in colour within and among species of birds? and (2) Why does the size, structure and behaviour of sperm vary so much from species to species? Thus, we are trying to understand how bright plumage of different colours helps male (and less often female) birds obtain mates of high quality. Our work on bird coloration is leading to a better appreciation of the nature of colour vision and the mechanisms by which colours are produced and displayed in nature. Our studies of sperm evolution are also designed to help us understand more about the diversity of animal structure and behaviour but they have some additional aquacultural, agricultural and medical applications in helping us to understand how a male's condition influences his sperm quality and fertilization success. It is becoming increasingly clear that both pre- and postcopulatory processes are important to the origin, diversification and maintenance of species, so our work makes an important contribution to the study of the speciation process.","Advancement of knowledge","Queen's University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","�volution et �cologie","�volution et �cologie"

"The research theme of my proposal is supply network innovation process. A supply network defines all activities and actors involved in the creation and delivery of solutions, products and services. It specifies their roles and responsibilities as well as their relationships and flows. Its scope ranges from the clients' clients of an enterprise up to its suppliers' suppliers. In an effort to survive and thrive in a global, digital, competitive and turbulent economy, enterprises are challenged to evolve, to redefine their business model, to relentlessly innovate, in terms of products and services, but also in terms of their supply network.



The research program I am proposing aims to contribute fundamental conceptual frameworks, methodologies, models and insights enabling industrial engineers and other supply network specialists to rigorously and creatively contribute to the supply network innovation process. The program further differentiates itself by emphasizing the following five key research drivers: (1) focus on supply networks addressing human (consumer) needs; (2) holistic stake, addressing the global scale, scope and complexity of the supply network; (3) Strategic aim for supply network innovation to enable business model innovation; (4) Win-win synergistic solutions taking into consideration the value contribution to all key stakeholders of the supply network; (5) Exploring the potential of emerging concepts, technologies and paradigms for next generation supply networks.

"Motor vehicle collisions cost the Canadian economy $63 billion each year, or five percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  Pedestrian collisions, which account for 13 percent of all road-related fatalities in the country, cost the economy $2 billion per year.  This situation is similar in the U.S. (and many other countries), where pedestrians account for 12 percent of all road-related fatalities and a large component of the country's GDP.  As a result, the safe accommodation of pedestrians in urban road infrastructure design and traffic engineering has become one of the critical issues facing many cities today.  Furthermore, as the population ages, impairments to mobility, vision and physical strength become prevalent, which can translate into accessibility limitations to the transportation infrastructure.  



Since roads and other transportation infrastructure are built for use by people, civil engineers are required to provide equitable access to all users of the transportation system.  However, there is insufficient knowledge about the accessibility needs of older pedestrians, or the exposure issues associated with pedestrian activity in urban infrastructure.  Consequently, existing transportation engineering handbooks and manuals have limited information specifically dealing with accessibility issues for older pedestrians and people with impairments.  Also, there is a lack of pedestrian volume data for planning and design of transportation infrastructure for these users.  This research develops new concepts that can be used by transportation engineers in the planning, design, operation and maintenance of urban transportation infrastructure that seeks to accommodate older pedestrians in a safe and equitable manner.  The research provides new information on the issues that need to be considered for the development of warrants, design guidelines, and dimension domains for transportation infrastructure that accommodates these users.  The development of pedestrian exposure indicators for pedestrian safety analysis and pedestrian-friendly design is also a product of this research.",Engineering,"University of Manitoba",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie civil","G�nie civil"

"Gravity or density-driven currents are ubiquitous in nature and may also be initiated as the result of human activities. Manifestations of such flows include,but are not limited to, powder snow avalanches, pyroclastic flows from volcanoes, magma flows from magma chambers, turbidity currents in the oceans, sea breeze fronts, break-out floods from the failure of end moraine dams, debris and mud flows, dense gas releases such as occurred in Bhopal India in 1984, and oil spills in reservoirs, lakes and oceans. Turbidity currents in the oceans lead to the formation of bottom deposits of silt and sand referred to as turbidites and these, in turn, often act as reservoirs for oil and gas and so are of great interest for their economic impact. Gravity currents that arise from 

dam failure may, through erosion and entrainment, generate powerful mud slides that can transport very large objects thereby causing serious damage to infrastructure and inflicting heavy casualties on the population living below the dam. 



Our research during the upcoming granting period will focus on the many aspects of gravity-driven flows including their ability to entrain material and thereby modify their driving buoyancy forces with a view to developing predictive models for the spread of such currents and the morphological bed changes that they bring about.

"Dynamic (or adaptive) treatment regimes are strategies in which treatment decisions are based on patient-specific characteristics that may vary over time, characteristics that may be demographic such as age or sex but may also be clinical, for example response to treatment in the past. It is very difficult to learn about the best adaptive treatment strategies, and so this area of research contains many open problems. In particular, it can be difficult to decide which patient characteristics are important to use to tailor, or individualize, treatment. 



My programme of research will address some of the many questions that remain in this field. This research is expected to have significant impact on the scientific community, both because of the complex statistical issues that must be addressed and because of the vast number of real problems in public health that can be addressed by good methodology. For example, these methods can be applied to answer questions such as ""when is it best to initiate therapy for HIV so as to prolong life while minimizing exposure to unpleasant side-effects and the possibility of resistance to therapy?"" or ""which is the best anti-psychotic drug to use for initial treatment of schizophrenia, and which drug provides the best second-line approach should the first treatment fail?"" 



There is at present a shortage of statisticians in North America. This is a dangerous situation, both for the science of statistics itself and the many fields such as public health research that rely on statistical expertise. My programme of research includes a concentration on training of statisticians at the graduate level.","Medical and health sciences","McGill University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Biostatistiques,"Statistique et probabilit�"

"We would like to offer theoretical underpining and practical guidance for how we might best preserve evolutionary history in the face of imminent extinction.  Every time a species goes extinct, the interacting complex of genes that it embodies dies with it.  Some species have many close relatives, and so there is a lot of redundancy in this history (think of different mice species), while others are isolated on the Tree of Life and so are the sole conveyers of this genetic information (the Walrus and mountain beavers are prime Canadian examples).  We can think of these lonely species as being particularly  'distinctive' and distinctiveness as one of many ways to value the elements of biodiversity.  The proposal sets out a series of questions that need to be answered: what are the most robust, flexible and straightforward ways to measure evolutionary distinctiveness?  In what ways are distinctive species expected to be different, and in what ways are they different?  Which species are the most distinctive in Canada? Finally, and importantly, how do Canadians currently give value to individual species?  Answers to all these questions should help us appreciate and safeguard our biological heritage.

"My primary research plan is to build a new instrument, specifically a new infrared spectrograph, which I will use on some of world's largest telescopes. New discoveries in astronomy are ever dependent on the capabilities of new instruments; therefore, building a new instrument is a fundamental and essential step for enhancing our understanding of the universe. It is also imperative to train students with this instrument program, which will greatly benefit the future of the Canadian astronomical community. In this instrumentation program, students will learn how to design and implement various components of a novel infrared spectrograph as part of their PhD thesis. This instrumentation program will be performed using the new laboratorial infrastructure that we recently established at the University of Toronto for modern astronomical instrumentation. In addition to this instrument program, I also plan to conduct observational studies of supernova remnants and massive stars using various facilities, including satellites in space and eventually the instruments that I built. A supernova remnant is the remains of a supernova explosion which is probably a single most spectacular event in the universe generated by the death of a massive star. By studying the supernova remnants and massive stars, I try to answer the following questions: [1] how do supernovae explode? [2] How are the evolutions of massive stars and consequent supernova explosions connected? [3] How are the evolutions of massive stars and the physics of supernova explosions are connected to the formation of black holes or neutron stars? [4] What is the role of mass loss in the evolution of massive stars? These are difficult questions to answer, but they are fascinating questions to address. Hopefully, based on the funding that I request in this proposal, I can give useful answers to the above questions in a few years.","Space and astronomy","University of Toronto",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Instrumentation,"Astronomie et astrophysique"
"The shape and size of multi-cellular organisms are determined by the coordination of the cell division and cell death pathways. Cell division produces sufficient masses of cells while cell death prevents over-production. These processes are regulated at the genetic level by several key genes. Studying how theses genes function helps us to understand how an organism grows during development and has potential importance in understanding the manifestation of certain diseases. A number of key genes involved in coordinating cell division belong to a family of evolutionarily conserved genes called E2Fs. E2Fs have the ability to promote both cell division and cell death. Indeed, E2Fs are shown to play important roles in controlling cell number in many different organisms including the fruit fly, Drosophila Melanogaster. Here, I propose to use Drosophila to investigate the role of E2Fs in cell death during development. While the function of E2Fs in cell division has been extensively studied, their role in cell death has been difficult to study due to the technical limitation. Recent advances in molecular and genetic techniques have made Drosophila an ideal system to study the effects of E2Fs on cell death during development. Both molecular and genetic analysis will be used to study how E2Fs coordinate cell division and cell death during Drosophila development. Furthermore, the most recent genetic techniques will be applied to develop tools that will facilitate this study.","Advancement of knowledge","McGill University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Biologie cellulaire","Biologie cellulaire"
"Organisms have evolved a complex suite of biochemical and physiological mechanisms to adjust to changes in their environment. Significant interactions occur between these mechanisms to ensure system balance and appropriate function under a variety of conditions. The long-term objective of my research program is to better understand the interplay between animal physiology and environment especially as it relates to metabolic processes and the impact of natural (hormones) and artificial (man-made, toxicants and pharmaceuticals) chemicals on these processes. Metabolism differs significantly between groups and species and is a sensitive indicator of environmental change. As vertebrates, teleost fishes share the hormones and complex signaling systems present across species within this group although with specific functional distinctions. As fish are in intimate contact with their aquatic environment, are found in a variety of aquatic environments, have distinct nutrient requirements, and represent the largest number of vertebrate species they represent ideal species to examine these animal-environment interactions and to test the affects of these environments on biodiversity. Over the next five years, my research program will examine three complimentary research approaches to better define the role of metabolism in animal-environment interactions. Specifically we will examine 1) the phylogeny and function of adrenoceptors, 2) differentiate between a central (brain) and peripheral (tissue) impact of toxicants on fish performance, and 3) define the role of cellular energy and nutrient sensors in the partitioning of nutrients within cells exposed to specific nutrient and environmental stressors. Graduate students will employ an integrative approach assessing whole animal and molecular responses to define the bases for the interactions between animals and their environments. The metabolic approach used is crucial for our understanding of the functional significance of hormones and toxicants on fish function while ultimately assisting in the development of diets for aquaculture that are sustainable both ecologically and physiologically.","Advancement of knowledge","University of Ottawa",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Physiologie et m�tabolisme des animaux","Biologie animale"

"Air injection is an enhanced oil recovery process that can be used to produce a wide range of crude oils from bitumens and heavy oils (6 to 14 API) through light oils (30 to 45 API).   The success of the light oil projects in the Williston Basin, USA and the heavy oil projects in Suplacu de Barcu, Romania and Mehsana, India have shown that air injection is a viable secondary and tertiary recovery process.  In Canada, the potential of applying in situ combustion as a follow up to SAGD in Athabasca Oil Sands is currently being considered by a number of operators as a means of extending the economic life of SAGD projects.  



A major factor hindering the application of air injection is the inability of numerical simulators to predict field scale performance.  Field predictions are being performed using thermal simulators such as CMG's ""STARS"", however the reliability of the predictions is highly questionable.  This is not surprising as current oxidation/combustion kinetics models can not predict the behavior of laboratory scale experiments, let alone field scale projects. Recent experimental work in our laboratory suggests that combustion reactions occurring in the vapor phase are much more important than the in situ combustion literature would suggest.  The proposed research program is focused on developing laboratory scale experiments which enable identification of the onset of vapor phase combustion as well as the role of phase equilibria on the global oxidation/combustion kinetics.

"The strength and stiffness of metal culvert structures depends on the composite behaviour of both the metal and soil components. While considerable work has been performed to understand the nature of load-sharing at normal operating loads (the earth and vehicle loads expected in service), little is known about behaviour at loac levels approaching collapse, how the different components of the composite system reach their strength limits, and how loads are redistributed from components in distress to others that still have reserve capacity. Since it has not been possible to conduct experiments that bring these structures to failure, it has not been possible to observe this nonlinear response and model it confidently on the computer. Current theories of metal culvert strength therefore assume that load sharing between the components at collapse is identical to load sharing at service loads. Furthermore, deeply corrugated metal box culverts manufactured in Canada are an important culvert type that has not been included in the computer modeling studies performed to date, which form the basis of current Canadian and US culvert design practice.

The objectives of the project are to: a. conduct large scale laboratory experiments using a new facility at Queen's, which will permit observations of nonlinear behaviour (including load redistribution) up to culvert collapse; b. study deeply corrugated metal box culverts, develop computer models for them, and use those new computer models to explore a range of culvert geometries and burial conditions; and c. develop simplified analysis models for metal box culverts for use in Canadian and US culvert design standards.

Computer modeling of the experiments will include linear and nonlinear, two dimensional and three dimensional analyses. The models will permit computer studies of conventional burial conditions, and will also be used to study the tolerance of metal box culverts to unusual loading conditions (associated with poor construction practice, for example). The project will train one MSc student and one PhD student.

"Evolving urbanization and deterioration of old sewer and water supply infrastructure have greatly increased public expenditures on repair and replacement (>$1B/yr in Ontario). Most research on buried pipes has worked to address bending and buckling around the pipe circumference, considering the pipe in its initial burial configuration over the full service life. However, other factors also influence failure mechanisms and service lives, and these require investigation:

1.Pipe failures often result from backfill deterioration as water inflow through joints or corrosion voids erodes the surrounding soil support and increases moments, and new methods are needed to analyze and understand backfill erosion and its impact;

2.Thermoplastic pipes (e.g. polyethylene) are held in position by backfill. Fracture mechanisms for gravity flow pipe are different to those induced by current pressure tests, given the influence of relaxation & bending, and service lives for fixed strain and bending need investigation;

3.Work is needed to resolve a number of issues associated with trenchless construction (ground movements during pipe bursting and directional drilling, and design methods for pressure pipe liners);

4.Cast iron and asbestos water pipes usually experience ring fracture as a result of differential ground movements, and the effects of frost or moisture changes in reactive soils need study.

5.The mechanics of phenomena like uplift buckling and bending where pipes span zones of earth movement down slopes also need to be studied.

Fourteen different projects in three theme areas are being proposed over the next five years of DG funding. Five MASc and nine PhD students will work on projects obtaining seminal test results, developing new methods of computer analysis, and producing new or improved procedures for pipe and culvert installation, assessment, and design.

"The objectives of my proposed research program are to improve our understanding of the influence that topography has on weather and climate. Mountains are of interest for a variety of reasons:  they act as a barrier to atmospheric flow that can impact the weather and climate in their immediate vicinity as well as downstream; the precipitation that falls on their slopes serves as a valuable source of water for nearby lower-elevation communities and ecosystems; and their glaciers serve as important archives of past climate variability. One of the challenges to doing such research is that the regions of interest are remote and sparsely populated. As a result, data collection is a challenge and our knowledge of the processes by which atmospheric flow interacts with topography is therefore limited.  A crucial and unique component of my research program therefore involves on-going data collection activities in mountainous regions, such as the Saint Elias Range in the Yukon Territory, Greenland and the Himalaya, where my group has made in-situ observations as to the impact that topography has on atmospheric flow.  We propose to use this data along with other instrumental and paleoclimate datasets as well as numerical models to further our understanding of the impact that topography has on weather and climate. 

     This proposed research program will improve our understanding of the important role that mountainous regions play in the climate system.  This knowledge will improve our ability to forecast the weather in and downstream of these regions as well as our ability to to interpret the climate signals in ice cores from these regions.

"Although much progress has been made in defining the C cycling in peatlands, the major challenge now is to determine the role that N plays in these nutrient-limited systems. Increases in N input, e.g. through atmospheric N deposition, pose major threats to many terrestrial ecosystems and C modelling is limited by coupling of C and N. My work focuses on the Mer Bleue peatland, the site of an intensive series of measurements & experiments over the past decade. I propose to answer the following questions:

-    )	How do bogs respond to elevated deposition of N and other nutrients? This is a continuation of an experiment started in 2000 with 9 treatments of N addition in which we have shown profound changes in species composition, biomass and growth and C and N biogeochemistry. 

-    )	How is N (as dissolved organic nitrogen [DON], NH4 and NO3) released through the decomposition of peat, and what is the linkage to the production of DOC and CO2 and CH4? 

-    )	How important is atmospheric N2 fixation to N cycling? Knowledge of rates of atmospheric N2 fixation and their controls is poor in northern peatlands and I will determine this by acetylene reduction assays in both undisturbed and fertilized sections, the latter testing the where ecological theory that increased N and P availability should decrease and increase N2 fixation, respectively.

-    )	Where do peatland plants get their N? Peat pore-water has DON as the dominant form (over NH4 and NO3), in boreal and tundra systems plants can take up organic forms of N:  is this the case in bog shrubs, herbs and mosses, to be tested with 13C and 15N labelled organics?

-    )	What controls root growth in bog systems? We have shown that most of the plant biomass is below-ground and will now determine root dynamics, along hydrologic/ nutrient gradients, with a mini-rhizotron.

-    )	How can we integrate N into peatland ecosystem models that are now well parameterized for C?

"The overall goal of this research is to understand the role of the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) in mammary physiology. The IGF-IR is the main signaling receptor mediating the effects of the two insulin-like growth factor (IGF) ligands, IGF-I and IGF-II. Until now, an in vivo model where the levels of the IGF-IR can be manipulated in the mammary gland did not exist. My lab has created a mouse model where the levels of IGF-IR can be overexpressed or returned to normal through the addition or withdrawal of doxycycline from the animals food supply. With this model the levels of IGF-IR can be increased at discrete physiologic stages of the mammary gland such as development, lactation and involution and the effects of IGF-IR overexpression on these process can be determined. The reason this type of study is important is that bovine somatotrophin (bST), also know as bovine growth hormone, has been used in dairy cattle to increase milk production for years. Growth hormone mediates a number of its effects by increasing IGF signaling. Therefore, our studies will determine whehter growth hormones effects in the mammary gland are mediate via IGF-IR signaling and whether enhancing IGF-IR signaling can replace growth hormone and directly promote milk production. Using this knowledge of IGF signaling we may eventually identify proteins or signaling networks that are more efficient and effective at promoting milk production in dairy cattles that bST.

"The main goal of our research programme is to design new catalysts for efficient synthesis with minimal environmental impact. Catalysis is now almost universally used in chemical and petrochemical processes. Catalysis has also quickly assumed a central place in Green Chemistry because of its benefits: lower energy consumption, lesser quantities of starting materials, lesser use of toxic materials, higher yield of the desired product, and decreased use of deleterious solvents. We will seek those goals by working at the interface between nanoparticle science and coordination chemistry to provide new catalytic systems. With this approach, we take advantage of the versatile and well-explored properties of metal ligands as they are used in coordination chemistry to modify, enhance and probe catalytic activity of metal nanoparticles. Firstly, we will investigate the structure/activity relationships in metal nanoparticles, emphasising the impact of the electronic properties of the ligands protecting the metallic core and of the surrounding environment. We will synthezise a library of metal nanoparticles (Au, Rh, Pd, ...) with a variety of different ligands such as thiols, phosphines, phosphites or amines. This library will be use to assess the structure/reactivity dependence of catalytic processes. Hydroformylation and alkyne activation will be among our major goals. We will  also investigate the potential of ionic liquids as a solvent for catalysis with nanoparticles, with the aim to enhance reactivity and allow tandem reactions. Secondly, we will use promising catalysts to effect important transfer hydrogenation reactions, especially on C=C and triple bonds.

"My research program focuses on a group of highly conserved enzymes (proteins) called protein phosphatases. Most cellular proteins get modified in the cell in very specific ways to allow control of their function in response to signals from outside or within the cell. The most common means of modifying a protein is the covalent attachment of a phosphate group. This is referred to as protein phosphorylation and the enzymes that add this phosphate are called protein kinases and the enzymes that remove this phosphate are protein phosphatases. My group works with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and by using the publicly available genome sequence data and information from other well characterized organisms (like humans and yeast) we have identified a complete set of protein phosphatases in this organism. By examining the amino acid sequence of these protein phosphatases we have been able to predict certain features for several of these enzymes and we are now doing the biochemistry and cell biology to further define the properties and role of these enzymes. My group is focusing on the type one phosphatases (PP1), which are regulated by targeting subunits that define their function. As yet, no targeting subunits are known in plants. Using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry we have identified 20 binding proteins and propose to perform a detailed characterization for 3 of them, including the putative nucleoside kinase ZAP3. Through bioinformatic insights we have also focused our attention on a completely novel chloroplast localized phosphatase. This enzyme is being characterized and we believe it may represent an ancient or ancestral form of the type one or 2A phosphatases. By using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry as a starting point, we have also identified a type 2A (PP2A) complex that interacts with several other cellular proteins and plays a role in controlling the trafficking of protein cargo in the cell. My research program is making the critical bridge between computer-based observations (bioinformatics) and the biochemistry, molecular and cell biology necessary to support these observations.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","University of Calgary",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres"

"This ongoing research program trains students in bioprocessing skills which are in demand by Canadian industry and academia. These skills are needed for the efficient design and control of biotechnology operations. Concurrently, the research explores new methods for producing pharmaceuticals and other biological products. In this proposal, we plan to use our extensive experience with fermentation systems to investigate bioprocessing strategies appropriate for production of a model protein product, such as found in therapeutic agents, and an enzyme product, such as used to make sugar from cellulosic materials. In addition to basic knowledge creation, the first application is of interest to the pharmaceutical industry and the second one is relevant to biorefineries that operate based on renewable biomass resources. According to our proposition, pneumatically-stirred bioreactor devices have distinct advantages over traditional mechanically-stirred ones for these applications in terms of energy conservation and less risk for contamination. These factors have been overlooked in previous work.

    )	The investigative approach involves evaluation of engineering principles as they relate to the potential improvement of pneumatically-stirred ""airlift"" bioreactor systems. The challenge is to overcome undesirable side effects from high fermentation viscosities and by-product formation in the systems. Engineering design guidelines for airlift devices will be developed, incorporating bioprocessing innovations for equipment retrofits and novel methods of operation. In addition, the guidelines would enable more rational scale-up procedures for these systems. Overall, results of the study are expected to generate well trained HQP and valuable new knowledge in the general areas of biochemical engineering and industrial biotechnology.

In the last decade, there has been an increasing awareness of the thin line between the notions of financial and insurance risks. Ideas as well as techniques have found their way from one field to the other. In this proposal, I intend to study several interconnected aspects of risk theory and financial mathematics. The main objective is the study and the application of different stochastic processes and their functionals as models of insurance and financial risks. Such has been the scope of the research in insurance and financial mathematics for decades, yet in this proposal we focus on certain promising aspects and features of this larger framework. I intend to work on a series of generalizations and applications of several insurance and financial models. The directions and implementations proposed in this project are original and depart significantly from current research efforts. The proposed studies include lines of research that only few people are now beginning to explore.  Classic ruin theory and their relation to known first-passage times for Levy processes and the potential generalizations that this brings about, risk models perturbed by a fractional Brownian motion, periodic risk processes with independent increments, Malliavin calculus applications in insurance, dependence structures for processes using Sibuya functions are a few of the proposed studies that represent original directions.

"Breast cancer is a leading cause of death in women.  If detected when the tumour is small, before it spreads, the survival rate is 90%.  EIT measures the differences between normal tissues and malignant or benign tumours.  By reducing the need for biopsy, EIT could save approximately $1 Billion annually in the USA alone.  The purpose of this proposal is to develop EIT to isolate a region of tissue, and to measure its frequency dependent electrical impedance directly - which can be used to estimate water content.  This proposal builds upon previous NSERC funded research, from which we plan to continue two main initiatives:



1) Design and construction of a 48 electrode EIT prototype. It is our hypothesis that by applying currents to a body at multiple frequencies, that there will be enough information not just to identify tissue damage, or cancerous lesions, but also to identify the cellular water volume in an image. Under this proposal, the prototype will move into the testing stage of its development, while implementing several design improvements.



2) We have had an extremely fruitful collaboration with the Integrated Manufacturing Technologies Institute of the NRC. We have been developing a tissue mimicking phantom to represent biological tissue from the perspective of both MRI and electrical impedance techniques. Further experimentation is required to modify its properties, and to design the phantom to reflect the CW and ECW content of tissue.



The benefits of this project will extend from basic research into improved health care. It will provide critical information for realizing our long term goals, i.e. enhanced in vivo detection of tissue damage, breast cancer lesions, and muscle metabolic disorders using changes in cellular volumes as disease markers.

"While an increasingly larger amount of data are transported across optical fiber networks by light pulses, and optical computing will soon be a reality, the efficient control of light for communication purposes and all-optical processing has become an extremely important target for the photonics engineers. 

For this reason, the PIs of this application have recently established a vigorous research program directed towards the development of a series of novel low power all-optical switches for applications in photonics and optoelectronics. In particular, our devices are based 1) on the propagation and interaction of solitons and light bullets in different active and passive media and 2) on the use of highly efficient, passive III-V nanoguides and glass ring resonators. 

Together with the fundamental interest, the experiments proposed here present several technical challenges which require an urgent equipment upgrade. For example, i) complex switching patterns (including  multi-beam interaction) will be obtained via the use of a Programmable Phase Modulator; ii) our experiments will be mainly performed in the telecommunication window (1550 nm), i.e. by amplifying our currently available fiber laser sources via a suitable Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier (dissipative solitons and switching in nanoguides), or by using a Optical Parametric Amplifier laser system (Light Bullets) ;  and finally iii) a dedicated  InGaAs camera will be critical  in such experiments where the signal to noise ratio is rather low (i.e., the observation of light bullets). Here, the measurements must be performed using our low repetition Optical Parametric Amplifier laser system, and hence proper imaging cannot be achieved with traditional vidicon cameras. 

This application will complement funding from other sources. The benefits related to our research programs are twofold: they will pave the way to the development of new advanced technologies and will promote the training of highly qualified personnel, consistently with the needs of Canadian industry and society.","Information systems and technology","Institut national de la recherche scientifique",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)",Photonique,Physique

This three year strategic project is concerned with the development of a series of novel integrated devices basec on a magneto-optic thin film technology. The proposed theoretical and experimental research will allow the university team members from INRS-EMT, in collaboration with their industrial partners, to lead Canadian and international efforts in searching for low-cost, high performance, integrated all-optical isolators. Our interest stems from the impact of magneto-optics on the development of communications and sensing applications in the form of isolators/circulators, which protect light sources from the instability caused by reflections. The sheer number of bulk isolators in use represents a major investment by the photonics industry. Nevertheless, further real progress depends upon integration and it is clear that the monolithic integration of magneto-optic components such as isolators/mode-converters with diode lasers is the task that must now be addressed. The objectives of this project are three-fold: (A) To complete a theoretical analysis of single mode, non reciprocal waveguides and optical isolators; (B) To develop high quality magneto-optic thin films based on a YIG substrate (the films will be deposited using a laser ablation technique) to be used as upper claddings in our devices and (C) To provide preliminary proof-of-concept experiments of the fabrication and characterization of waveguides incorporating magneto-optic layers.

The resulting, highly compact devices could have a dramatic impact in several disciplines, such as telecommunication engineering, spectroscopy and metrology. The simplicity of our design and the mature technology of semiconductor waveguides may well lead to the cost/performance and mass-reproducible characteristics which are prerequisite to successful commercialization. Finally, the new knowledge generated from this project and the training of highly qualified personnel associated to the different stages of this work will certainly contribute to enhance Canada's global competitiveness, especially in the most advanced high-technology sectors.

"While the developments in semiconductor science and technology have led to the electronic age and to a second industrial revolution, it is becoming clear that photonics will be the next trillion-dollar industry. An increasingly larger amount of data are transported across the ""information highway"" by light pulses, yet the main limitation of present optical networks originates from the necessity of performing a clumsy conversion from light to electronics to process the signal, and then back to light for its transmission. The direct control of light for communication purposes and other applications, such as optical computing and quantum encryption, is in fact the photonics frontier. Given this unquestionable interest, I have recently developed at the INRS-EMT a vigorous research program in photonics and in particular, in integrated optics. In the framework of the present Discovery Grant, I intend to shed some light into the relation between quantum mechanics, wave optics and (integrated) optoelectronics to investigate two fundamental aspects related to the control of light. Specifically, in the next five years, I will study: A) The possibility of using relatively novel quantum mechanical concepts, such us the so called ""Parity Time"" potentials, to address some of the current challenges in the industry, including the possibility of creating a new class of non reciprocal materials for the realization of integrated optical isolators and B) the properties of single photon optics in complex integrated devices (such as waveguide arrays, i.e. arrays of identical, evanescently coupled waveguides), first using a ""semi-classical"" approach based on the Hanbury Brown and Twiss model and then looking at low count photon correlations in suitable all-optical switches.

The benefits related to such an ambitious research program are twofold: not only they will pave the way to the development of new advanced technologies, consistently with the IMMEDIATE needs of Canadian photonics industry, but they will also promote the training of highly qualified personnel to respond to the scientific and technological challenges of our modern society.

"In this proposal, the applicant intends to study moduli spaces of stable bundles and sheaves on non-Kaehler surfaces and threefolds. An important problem in the study of complex manifolds is the classification of objects on these manifolds such as vector bundles and sheaves. Holomorphic vector bundles on polarized projective varieties have been extensively studied and their geometry is by now well understood; however, far less is known in the non-projective case. This is due to the fact that many of the techniques used for projective varieties only give partial results for general compact complex analytic manifolds. The goal of this research is to gain a better understanding of the non-projective picture by examining non-projective varieties such as non-Kaehler compact complex manifolds. 



Another motivation for the study of bundles on non-Kaehler complex manifolds comes from recent developments in superstring theory. Of particular interest in this theory are complex manifolds with holomorphically trivial canonical bundles as they are potential backgrounds for compactifications of strings - certain vector bundles on the manifold determine these compactifications. Most of the models appearing in the physics literature have, until recently, been of strings compactified on elliptic Calabi-Yau manifolds equipped with a Kaehler metric. Nevertheless, there is now growing interest in non-Kaehler manifolds as other possible backgrounds for string compactifications. 



Some of the non-Kaehler complex manifolds that will be considered by the candidate play a fundamental role in many areas of mathematics and physics. The results of this research will therefore provide many explicit examples of moduli spaces that will be of interest to a wide range of geometers, physicists, gauge theorists, researchers in the field of integrable systems, and model theorists.

"The proposed research will focus primarily on the evolutionary ecology of reproductive scheduling in salmonid fishes. In most species of Pacific salmon, individuals achieve all their reproductive success in one short breeding season and die after a period of rapid physiological decline (senescence). Stored energy is used for migration and reproduction and must be carefully allocated between reproductive traits and body maintenance to ensure survival during the spawning season. Moreover, timing of migration, reproduction, and senescence are critically important to ensure that eggs get deposited, fertilized, and survive over the winter. This area of my research has three objectives: 1) determine whether variation in energy stores (fat, protein) and energy expenditure during spawning can explain variation in reproductive lifespan (i.e., the period between arrival at breeding sites and death), 2) determine how age-specific patterns of senescence evolve in response to anadromy and environmental mortality (predation risk and high stream temperatures), and 3) develop and test hypotheses for why some early-arriving females delay spawning after their arrival at breeding areas (i.e., pre-spawning waiting). The proposed research is important to evolutionary biologists, conservation biologists, the fishing industry, and the general public. It will contribute new information about how reproductive scheduling evolves by natural selection and will allow predictions to be made about the consequences of natural environmental or anthropogenic change. Such knowledge will inform fisheries and land-use management to ensure protection of phenotypic diversity. 



An additional research objective is to test for adaptation of egg size to spawning habitat in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Egg size is an important life history trait and understanding the evolutionary and environmental causes of variation among populations may improve lake trout rehabilitation strategies in the Laurentian Great Lakes.

"Anaerobic bacteria grow in the absence of oxygen. While they are being found to increasingly contribute to disease in many settings the study of anaerobes is grossly under-represented due in part to the difficulty in working with these organisms. My lab has been involved in studying these infections and we employ as a model sytem bovine footrot (BFR) caused by Porphyromonas levii, a black-pigmented anaerobe that synergistically contributes to the disease. BFR serves as a perfect model system for anaerobic infection and is perceived by Canadian farmers as noteworthy, a significant irritation in conventional animal production, as well as a major cause of animal discomfort and lameness. As animal welfare concerns intensify, and as current uses of antibiotics are scrutinized more closely, infectious diseases such as BFR will have much larger impact. Understanding BFR more fully is critical as the pressures to restrict large-scale antibiotic use (current control method) increase in society. BFR infection is intellectually intriguing because of its complex polymicrobial nature, its ubiquity in the world's cattle, the acute pyogenic character (ie. pus formation typifies BFR) of the response in affected animals, and its suitability as a model of bacterial synergism, hence providing insight in other such infections. Critical are the nature and function of white blood cells such as neutrophilic leukocytes (PMN) and macrophages in resolution, or lack of resolution, of BFR (ie. dead/dying PMN are the primary constituent of pus). The severity of BFR unquestionably hinges on a complex interplay of the bacteria including their repertoire of virulence attributes (such as the black pigment) and the cattle host, including the animals' immune cell responses (PMN and macrophages). My lab specializes in examining these phenomena. For some time now we have been alone in evaluation of the virulence of P.levii. We have studied bovine PMN and macrophages, in conjunction with our interests and capability in the antimicrobial resistance research, for years. This research proposal coalesces these interests through the unique role bacterial pigment plays in infection, pathophysiology, and resistance to treatment.

"The present research proposal focuses on airfoil and bluff body noise at low speed. These two canonical problems are the building blocks for the future prediction of low speed fan noise and airframe noise generated by high lift devices or landing gears. The proposal should then respond to strong environmental needs related to low speed fan noise. By its airframe noise perspective, it should be complementary to the industrial NSERC Chair in Aviation Acoustics, which rather focuses on the turbo-engine noise sources. It is directed towards developing (1) tools to simulate and predict aeroacoustic phenomena generated by the interaction of a flow with a solid surface, from the sources of noise (i.e. the emission phase) to their reception by a human being (i.e. the propagation phase), and (2) innovative noise control concepts and technologies to reduce these nuisances. Ultimately these prediction tools and noise control techniques will be applied at the system level to reduce the noise from low speed fans, high lift devices and landing gears. They will be integrated in their design process to guarantee that noise specifications of these products and new environmental regulations are met.  Airfoil and bluff body noise sources can be divided into two main themes: self-noise and interaction noise which will yield both tonal and broadband contributions. In both cases, detailed unsteady numerical simulations are performed to predict the noises sources accurately and an acoustical analogy is used to propagate the sound in the far field. The resulting result is compared with measurements performed in open-jet anechoic wind tunnel to validate the acoustic analytical models.",Aerospace,"Universit� de Sherbrooke",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie m�canique","G�nie m�canique"

"Genome and metagenomics projects continue to flood databases with genes whose products have unknown functions. Computational methods are essential to provide clues about the functions of such gene products because the genetic databases grow at a much faster rate than those of experimental functional characterizations. The main aims of this research program are (a) to detect functional modules, groups of genes whose products work together, and (b) to contribute to the understanding of their evolution. To do so, I will develop and refine computational methods to predict functional relationships of gene products. Detected groups and networks of functional interactions should complement currently known modules as well as reveal new ones. Examples of functional modules in Prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea) include: operons, stretches of genes transcribed together; regulons, genes whose expression is coordinated by the same regulatory protein; stimulons, genes responding to a particular signal or stimulus; and pathogenicity islands, groups of genes whose products confer pathogenic characteristics. Because the specific members of a functional module within each genome vary, another aim is to identify the main players or core genes within each module, and the peripheral players, which might be responsible for particular adaptations.

"Complex and sensitive biological molecules such as proteins can be effectively separated and concentrated by membrane filtration processes as a result of the high throughput and mild operation conditions offered by these processes. Despite such advantages, the performance of membrane processes may not meet the industrial requirements for a cost-competitive process.

Health benefits associated with a diversity of food ingredients have recently gained importance. For example, the health benefits of soy foods have received growing consumer's interests. This is primarily the result of the approval in 1999 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow manufacturers to make a health claim for soy proteins' ability to lower the risk for coronary disease based on a wealth of clinical and nutritional studies showing the positive effects of soy proteins. Other health benefits are associated with soy protein hydrolysates that have shown to possess antioxidant properties that may help reduce a number of diseases. 

The proposed research program will allow us to contribute to the development of innovative green processes for the production of soy protein products with enhanced functional and health promoting properties to be used in foods and nutraceutical products The green technologies to be developed will involve membrane processes that avoids the use of solvents and harmful chemicals with minimal waste generation.

"One of the most intriguing regularity in the structure of stream communities is that, although there is tremendous spatial and temporal variability in the abundance of various taxa and life stages, the size distribution is remarkably predictable. Our research has shown empirically that size distributions of stream organisms are correlated to physical habitat characteristics although the actual mechanisms underlying the patterns have not been tested. My students and I propose to test two hypothesized mechanisms that could account for the observed patterns. The first hypothesis states that available space, because of the fractal nature of stream beds, constrains densities of organisms of different size. The second hypothesis is that changes in trophic level with increasing size accounts for the general decline in abundance with increasing size. These two hypotheses will be tested in natural conditions by estimating available space for organisms of different sizes using close range digital photogrammetry techniques to describe habitat configuration at the mm scale, and by the use of nitrogen stable isotopes to estimate the average trophic level of organisms in different size classes. 



It is well known that hydrological regimes of running water systems are greatly affected by urbanization but it only has recently been recognized that the magnitude of these hydrological changes depends mostly on the impervious surfaces that are directly linked to streams rather than the total amount of impervious surfaces. The proposed research will examine how biological productivity and community structure respond to changes in the proportion of impervious surfaces in the catchments that are directly connected to streams. It has implications both in terms of advancements in stream ecology and for developing management strategies to mitigate impacts of urban development on freshwater systems.

"As humans, we are able interact with our environment because our muscles contract and produce force and/or movement about a joint. A rotational force, or torque, caused by muscles acting about one joint, e.g. the elbow, can translate to a linear force at another point along the limb, e.g. the wrist or hand, allowing us to apply these forces to objects in the environment and perform tasks, such as lifting a coffee cup or a bag of groceries. In general, several muscles act on an individual joint. For example, the elbow is controlled by the flexor muscles (the biceps brachii, brachialis and brachioradialis) which act to decrease the joint angle and pull the wrist towards the shoulder, and an extensor muscle (the triceps brachii) which acts to straighten the arm. In order to perform a task, the central nervous system (CNS) activates the relevant muscles in a coordinated fashion. Because of the biomechanical characteristics of the muscles and the musculoskeletal system, the force produced by individual muscles is a function of their activation levels, as well as joint position and movement velocity. Much work has been done to understand the interrelationship between these factors and several models have been developed. However, these models do not fully explain the production of output force or the interaction of the muscle activations and joint position and velocity. In the proposed work, novel mathematical techniques will be applied to model the production of force at the wrist, due to torque generated at the elbow. These techniques will incorporate physiological information, permitting an evaluation of the level and form of contribution of the individual muscles and the effect of joint parameters (position and velocity) on the production of force, and providing a reliable prediction of output force. This will improve our understanding of how motor tasks are controlled by the CNS. In future these models could be applied to understand how control of body movements and forces are affected by injury or disease, in the design of improved rehabilitation strategies, and for use in control of assistive devices, e.g. prosthetic limbs, which provide remote interaction with the environment.

"The human genome possesses ~21000 genes; genes encode proteins, but the genes themselves are split, organizing the protein coding regions into discrete blocks called ""exons"".  The genes are transcribed into RNA in a process called ""transcription"".  After the genes are transcribed into RNA, the exons are stitched together in a process called ""splicing"".  The splicing process can also stitch the exons together in alternative orders which will generate proteins with different sequences and functions.  The unique set of proteins within a cell is defined by the control processes that regulate transcription and splicing to select which genes and which order of the exons are used.  This regulation is a primary means cells modify their protein repertoire to adapt to their environment.  Recently, scientists have learned that splicing and transcription are not regulated independently, but are co-regulated by proteins and processes not yet understood.  We study two closely related human proteins that may regulate both the order of exons and modulate the level of transcription.  These proteins are enzymes, called ""kinases"", which add a phosphate molecule to sites on other proteins, thus modifying their function.  In our experiments, we have identified several other proteins that interact with these kinases, thus providing information on how these kinases carry out their functions.  In our studies, we will characterize the specific functions of both kinases and their interacting proteins.  From this information, we will learn more about how the process that controls the order of exon splicing is coordinated with the activity of the process that transcribes genes into RNA.  This will help us understand, and perhaps control, how cells express a unique set of genes to live and grow.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","University of British Columbia",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Prot�ines et peptides, acides amin�s",Biochimie

"The two main objectives of the proposed research program are 1) the development of new supramolecular scaffolds for the surface immobilization of pristine C60 and 2) the development of new methodologies for the preparation of stable, shape-persistent organic nano-objects.

The preparation of stable, well-defined C60-modified electrodes is of particular importance for the development of the next generations of nano-electronic devices, but good strategies to immobilize C60 on surface are still lacking. We propose to synthesize new [3]rotaxanes with recognition units (electron-rich conjugated moieties) oriented in a face-to-face configuration in order to complex C60 (2:1 complex) through supramolecular interactions. The rotaxane scaffold will be used to properly orient the recognition unit in space. Those rotaxanes will be assembled on metallic substrates and complexation studies with C60 will be conducted. This molecule will further be used to modify electrode surfaces to generate electrical current under illumination for photoelectrochemical applications or as a power supply unit for nanoscale devices.

The second part of the proposal involved the preparation of stable, shape-persistent organic nano-objects. Up to now, most of the organic nanotubes have been synthesized using supramolecular approaches in which the nanotubes building blocks are stacked and hold together by H-bonding or pi-pi interactions. However, those nanotubes often exhibit low kinetic stability due to fast assembly-disassembly equilibrium. Thus, we propose to prepare kinetically stable organic nanotubes by linking together, through covalent attachments, the outer surface of rigid phenylene ethynylene macrocycles (PEM) assembled on a polymeric scaffold. Because PEMs are rigid, the nanotubes thus formed are not expected to collapse, making them easier to characterize and functionalize, especially on the inner wall. In addition to nanotubes, nanocapsules having different sizes, shapes and functions will be synthesized by means of a molecular imprinting approach using different monomolecular templates as the negative mold and rigid dendrons as the cross-linking agent.

"This proposal is to request funds for the development of our electrochemical characterization facility. This includes two potentiostat/galvanostat instruments that were both damaged due to electrical problems in my laboratory. These pieces of equipment are essential to support our research efforts in the area of modified electrodes. All of our research deals with low dimensionality systems (molecular layers and thin films) and the importance of changes in material properties due to the creation or presence of interfaces. Our research program objectives are 1) to gain understanding of the organization of molecules (and atoms) at surfaces using various chemical and physical surface modification techniques such as electrodeposition, self-assembly and by covalent attachment on Si-H surfaces; 2) to study relevant properties of these films using our expertise in scanning probe methods and electrochemistry; and 3) ultimately to understand the formation of these materials and to relate their structures and morphology to their electrochemical/electronic, catalytic or/and magnetic properties. The work involves a variety of systems such as electrodeposited crystalline bismuth thin films as magnetic sensors; metal phthalocyanines as model catalysts and the chemical modification of nanoporous titanium dioxide using dye and ternary alloy semiconductor films for applications in low costs solar cell devices.

"There is a strong drive in the scientific community to control matter on the nanometer length scale that is at the level of atoms, molecules, and supramolecular structures to create useful materials, devices and systems for application in nanotechnology. Chemists have contributed greatly to this area by proposing new ways to assemble, pattern and incorporate molecules and materials that can have potential impact on the cost, speed and quality of the next generation of electronic devices such as chips, hard drive memory and energy efficient monitors. Our research program deals in one way or another with low dimensionality systems and the importance of changes in material properties due to the modification of their surface. The first objective of this research program is to produce and characterize functional films on silicon surfaces. Wet chemistry on silicon surfaces was shown to be particular well suited for future integration in nanotechnology's ""bottom-up"" fabrication strategy.  The approach taken in our work shows promises in creating good quality films that can then be used for property characterizations and device fabrication. This is paramount since the first concern of colleagues interested in applications for these materials is related to the presence of oxide at the silicon surface. The presence of silicon oxide impurities will have a great impact on the future device performance. Ultimately we wish to understand the formation of these materials and to relate their structures and morphology to their electrochemical/electronic properties.

"A broad and versatile seismology and geophysics program is conducted at the University of Saskatchewan. The main directions of the program are.



Studies of seismic reflectors within the deep continental crust. The nature of reflectors within deep crust is unclear and is being extensively debated. In these studies, we will make a step to understanding these problems by using high-quality reflection and refraction seismic data from Canada and Russia.



Seismic investigations of the upper mantle. We propose to lead the international effort for building a powerful, environmentally clean vibrational source that could allow seismic sounding to of the Earth's mantle (100-400 km depths). We will also continue studies of the mantle by analysing the nuclear explosion records from Russia and  by studying seismic waves from distant earthquakes.



Earthquake monitoring in Saskatchewan. We propose to build a new, permanent, digital seismographic network in Saskatchewan. The network will be built using our own, inexpensive instruments, and will be used for continuous monitoring natural and mining-related seismicity. 

 

Applied studies. Taking advantage in our expertise in several areas of seismology and geophysics, we will also contribute to several applied studies related to exploration for resources, carbon dioxide storage, and mitigation of mining hazards.

"Methane and other hydrocarbons have been detected in Earth's oldest rocks, meteorites, and the atmospheres of other planets. On Earth, these hydrocarbons are often thought to be products of biological activities, and thus can indicate the presence of life today or billions of years ago. Therefore the investigation of hydrocarbons has implications for the study of the origin and evolution of life on early Earth, and the search for life in extreme environments and on other planets. Hydrocarbons, however, can also be produced by non-biological (abiogenic) reactions, yet the conditions under which these hydrocarbons are synthesized are not well understood. To differentiate between the biogenic and abiogenic hydrocarbons, the geologic conditions for creating abiogenic hydrocarbons and reaction inhibitors must be determined. Subsequently, unique geochemical indicators must be identified for abiogenic hydrocarbons. In natural settings, there is added difficulty identifying abiogenic hydrocarbons. Reactions between groundwater and the rock it flows through, such as serpentinization (the hydration of ultramafic rock), produce conditions amendable for abiogenic hydrocarbon production as well as chemolithotrophic life. Biological reactions can modify or overprint abiogenic signatures. Therefore, studying carbon cycling in locations favourable for abiogenic hydrocarbon production and chemolithotrophic life must be examined to determine these modifications, to identify life that can survive in extreme pH conditions that are created during serpentinization, and to determine the dependence of life in these systems on products of serpentinization. The research into early life and water-rock reactions in ultramafic rocks will benefit Canadians through the advancement of knowledge of life's evolution on Earth and the production of abiogenic hydrocarbons.

"My research team studies the evolution of behaviour, how it interacts with changes in wildlife populations, and how it determines their use of habitat.  We conduct controlled experiments in a unique field laboratory where native small mammals can choose to move among large 1/4 ha enclosures.  Each enclosure contains a different natural habitat.  We control the identity of species making the decisions, their population densities, and the set of enclosures that they can move through.  



We will use this grant to purchase new, emerging radio-frequency technologies.  Pilot studies confirm the suitability of the technology under our field conditions.  The system works as follows:  Each experimental animal is identified with a small transponder.  The transponder's unique barcode is recorded by pairs of antennae placed on opposing sides of open gates between enclosures.  Data on each individual's weight and movement are recorded and stored automatically in field data loggers.  We download the remotely collected field data into a laptop computer and merge those data with computer models to evaluate competing theories on dispersal and habitat selection.  We thus obtain a continuous and unparalleled record of growth rates, pregnancies, and dispersal of these secretive nocturnal animals without disturbing them.  We combine that knowledge to infer habitat quality.  Computer software organizes the vast amounts of incoming data, and incorporates them into simulated experiments running in the computer's geographic information system (GIS).  The novel combination of field and computer experiments running in an experimental landscape through GIS will maximize our ability to understand how habitat and climate change influence animal populations.  Though our work is focused on using model species to test theory, the results, and the techniques we are developing, are crucial to conserving and managing wildlife in real landscapes.

"All organisms require space in which to live and all are capable, at some point in their life cycle, of moving from one habitat to another.  The range of habitats occupied, and dispersal among habitats, determines the geographical range of species and how the sizes of their populations change from place to place and through time.  But ecologists are only beginning to learn the rules that animals use to select habitat, how their choice responds to environmental change, and how habitat, and movement among habitats, influences population density.  



Most researchers studying these issues attempt to gain insight using only theoretical models, maps of the current distribution of species, or observations on individuals in the lab.  Our approach is fundamentally different.  We merge theory, computer simulations, controlled experiments and detailed observations on individuals to assess habitat selection.  To do this, we designed and built the world's first Habitron; a field facility designed explicitly to study habitat and habitat selection on mammals.  Gates between the Habitron's 24 enclosures allow us to manipulate the habitat choices that are available to individuals.  



The Habitron is equipped with the most recent technologies to simulate habitat selection with computer programs, to monitor the movement of individuals, and to evaluate their success.  We will use the Habitron to learn whether animals choose habitats that maximize their evolutionary fitness, how  patch use by animals can measure the quality of their habitat, how environmental change modifies habitat choice, and how habitat selection helps to regulate population density.  We will then ground-truth our results on free-living populations to evaluate how our understanding of habitat selection can aid in the conservation and management of natural populations.

"Our long-term research objective is to design and understand the functioning of new catalysts for bulk or fine chemical synthesis with applications in fragrance, flavours and pharmaceutical industries and catalysts for hydrogen storage, production or sensing for applications in the energy field. Over the past five years we have developed a variety of successful homogeneous catalysts and asymmetric catalysts based on ruthenium and osmium with hydride, phosphorus and nitrogen donor ligands. These are active for the selective hydrogenation of polar bonds including ketones for the production of alcohols and the hydrogenation of imines and nitriles for the synthesis of valuable amines. The same versatile catalysts are effective for asymmetric Michael addition reactions for fine chemical synthesis. This year we have discovered  very active iron catalysts that are less expensive, less toxic and more environmentally friendly than ruthenium, rhodium or palladium catalysts. The iron catalysts will be a primary focus of the proposed research along with extensions of our ruthenium chemistry and exploratory work with other transition metals. Our successful approach to catalyst discovery involves the synthesis of well-defined complexes within or near to the postulated catalytic cycle and a careful study of their mode of action by measurement of rates and isotope effects, activation energies, and by ab initio calculations. An objective is relating the structure and electronics of the catalytic species with their activity and selectivity. Another objective is to improve the methods of synthesis and the properties of the catalysts to make them useful and easy to reuse. Such catalysts often have metal-hydrogen bonds. The protonic and hydridic reactivity of these compounds will continue to be studied in our lab in order to better understand catalysts and predict new chemical reactions.

"What causes a road to develop washboard ripples?  Why does honey curl when it hits the pancake?  What determines the rippled shape of icicles?  All these questions are the subject matter of Pattern Formation, the branch of condensed matter Physics that deals with the emergence of ordered stuctures under driven, open, far-from-equilibrium conditions.  Condensed matter physics usually treats systems in a state of equilibrium, where they show no change in time.  A perfect crystal is an example of order that appears in equilibrium.  Ordered structures can also appear when a system is driven into motion by outside forces.  In fact, most of the order we see in the universe is of this kind.  This category of order encompasses everything from ripples on wind-blown sand to the structure of galaxies to Life Itself.  Patterns have underlying symmetries and mathematical similarities that can be investigated by a combination of laboratory experiments, theory and computer simulation.  Patterns exhibit universal behaviour across many length and time scales.

    The research program of the Experimental Nonlinear Physics Group at the University of Toronto involves work on washboard road, icicle and stalactite shapes, patterns in the flow of viscous fluids, like honey, fracture patterns in cracking lava, the flow of liquid crystals and many other experiments.  Our aim is to understand the Physics behind these diverse phenomena under the rubric of Pattern Formation, as well as to bring new physical understanding to patterns encountered in fields normally thought to be far removed from Physics.

"As a computer scientist working in the discipline of biosystems engineering, my long term research program focuses on the application of computational geometry to the fundamental physical sciences of imaging and analyzing food and biological materials.  In the analysis of materials, traditional spectroscopic techniques provide the spectral signature of a chemical sample, modern spectroscopic imaging provides entire spectra at each pixel of a sample.  While each technology and manufacturer has equipment with differing spatial resolutions many devices offer hundreds of thousand of pixels per sample.  Similarly spectral resolution varies from the multispectral (tens of spectra per pixel) to hyperspectral (hundreds to tens of thousands per pixel). 

    )	Computational geometry typically analyzes structure within a geometric abstraction of a data set.  As an example of geometric structure, a particular substance's spectra can be considered geometric data by considering individual peaks in the spectra and their magnitude as separate mathematical values (features) of that data point.  Sets of substances (i.e., data points) can be analyzed to find clusters/structures of chemicals with similar chemical bonds (e.g. chemical sub-groups).   

    )	The long term goal of the proposed research is to establish computational geometry as a key component in the analysis and acquisition of spectral signals and their use in the determination of quality of food and biological materials.  My short term goals focus on two areas:  the use of nearest neighbour methods to perform cluster and classification analysis of spectral data and the use of polygonal simplification and estimation techniques to improve data acquisition in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

"The goal of my research is to understand the most fundamental constituents of energy and matter.  This involves studying both the very smallest and the very largest length scales we are able to probe.  Our current understanding of the basic constituents of nature is incomplete, and this has lead particle physicists to propose the existence of new elementary particles and forces.  The most promising candidates include a new property of spacetime called supersymmetry, and new spatial dimensions of space that we can't see because they are are very small and curled up upon themselves.  If either of these proposals is correct, we are likely to observe them in the next few years at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiment.  The primary focus of my research is to try to make sense of and to help discover these possibilities for new phenomena beyond what we have discovered so far. 



  Our current understanding of particle physics is also unable to explain what we observe over the very largest length scales, greater than the size of a galaxy.  By probing the very large-scale structure of the universe, we are able obtain information about the very first moments after the Big Bang, when the universe was a hot soup of elementary particles.  What is observed indicates that there must exist new particles and forces beyond what we have discovered so far.  Upcoming astrophysical measurements will soon tell us more about what these exotic particles and forces.  The second major focus of my research is to try to deduce what these new phenomena are, and to relate them to the particles and forces we might observe at the LHC and other subatomic experiments.

"    )	     )	Lipid molecules dispersed in water assemble into thin layers with polar headgroups on the outside and flexible hydrocarbon chains inside. These bilayers are important as soft materials and as the structural basis for cell membranes.  By applying wideline NMR to model systems with deuterated components, we learn how composition and component structure affect the organization, mechanical properties, and motion of components in such materials and address questions of both material and biological significance.  

    )	We are one of only a few groups worldwide able to apply NMR to model membranes under pressure. We use this to relate molecular characteristics to the way in which bilayers are perturbed by pressure and to observe bilayer states not otherwise accessible.  How bilayers respond to pressure can give insight into their properties at normal pressure, guide theoretical studies, and help to show how marine organisms survive pressure changes.  

    )	We also look at how bilayer properties are modified by embedded proteins and conversely, using NMR observations of deuterium-labelled model polypeptides, how motions of embedded transmembrane proteins are affected by bilayer properties. This contributes to our understanding of bilayer mechanical properties and of transmembrane processes essential to biological cell function.     )	Breathing is made possible by a lipid layer that reduces surface tension at the air-water interface in lungs. We collaborate with life science colleagues to study how embedded proteins enable transfer and reorganization of material from bilayer reservoirs to this surfactant layer. This contributes to development of artificial surfactants for treatment of lung problems and to development of strategies for control of large-scale organization in self-assembled lipid-like materials.    )	

    )	Another line of study in our group is the issue of how structural characteristics of specific bilayer components, including different lipid classes and proteins, affect their mixing properties in bilayers. This is timely given increasing recognition of a role for membrane heterogeneity in the control of membrane protein activity.

"Support is required to build a Frazil Ice Monitoring System (FIMS) that will serve to quantify suspended frazil ice processes in rivers, estuaries and the nearshore. Frazil needs to be quantified because in ice-infested waters, frazil is the main mechanism for heat transfert from water to air and therefore is the primary actor in any river, estuary or ocean. Knowledge about its formation, evolution and transformation is required for any marine public works or climate change studies. Furthermore, frazil is responsible for the sudden blockage of municipal, industrial and nuclear energy water intakes. Frazil is notoriously difficult to monitor and quantify because its grain size is continuously changing and it is extremely volatile (so cannot be handled). 



The requested funds will primarily support the integration of existing submersed and atmospheric instruments into a coherent system and to purchase a holographic submerged laser camera (LISST-HOLO) that reveals the particle concentration and size distribution. It will also be used by a team member for field studies of suspended plankton since some of their fundamental behaviours are still unknown. Funds will also be used to obtain a radio sonde to quantify atmospheric radiation fluxes responsible for frazil formation. This sonde will also be used by a team member to support micro-meteorological-hydrogical studies in agriculture. 



FIMS will be the first comprehensive monitoring system for frazil ice in the world. The sytem will include monitoring of: atmospheric radiation, heat and mass transfer; surface conditions (water/air/ice); water depth, current, salinity and temperature; and suspended particle concentration and grain size at a specific point (using the LISST) and throughout the full water depth (using sonars operating at 5 frequencies). As such, frazil ice processes in natural conditions will be revealed and theoretical models for its formation and evolution and transformation will be developed.

"It is essentiel for public safety that dams maintain their structural integrity at all times. They must resist against

all applied forces, including those applied by ice. However, when responsible hydraulic structure owners and

managers try to act on this principle, they are confronted with widely diverging criteria: Whereas the Canadian

Dam Association recommends a design value of 150 kN/m, some public agencies, in some cases, apply a

criterion of only 100 kN/m. This reduces the cost of thousands of interventions, but is this criterion safe?

Researchers seem to be recommending ever increasing design values (reaching 250 kN/m or more in some

cases). This ensures safety, but given that a high percentage of existing dams do not meet this criterion and the

implied costs to reabilitate them, are these high values scientifically realistic?

A Hydro-Qu�bec engineering committee tried to harmonize existing criteria. However, due to knowledge gaps,

it soon came to the conclusion that the only way to come to a sound judgement was to carry out further

research. The purpose of this project is to to meet this need by validating previous findings and filling in the

knowledge gaps.The methodology will include comprehensive field observations; material property characterisation and FEM numerical modelling of key ice failure mecanisms (such as bending and buckling) including real reservoir

boundary conditions and ice forces generated thermal expansion and water level fluctuations. Models of forces

induced by fluctuations are virtually non-existant and yet they have been shown to dominate the process.

The product will be realistic scientifically-based ice force criteria to protect the public against potential dam

failure.

"My research focuses on the interplay between tectonism and the formation of mineral deposits along the active margins of continents.  Continental margins are geological complex, and are commonly the locus of a wide variety of tectonic processes, including the subduction of oceanic crust and resulting development of volcanic/plutonic arcs, such as those in the South American Andes, as well as collision of arcs or microcontinents with the main continental margin, and/or episodic extensional (rifting) events.  Formation of base and precious metal mineral deposits in such settings is also very complex; however, a better understanding of the nature and controls on formation of deposits in these settings will greatly enhance our ability to explore for and find new mineral resources.  I am investigating a variety of styles of continental margins and associated mineral deposits, including continental (""Andean-type"") magmatic arcs, relatively juvenile arc settings that formed immediately adjacent to the edges of continents, and ""orogenic"" gold deposits formed in both post-collisional settings, and within accretionary prisms during subduction of spreading ridges.  I am carrying out parallel studies of each of these settings in the Canadian Cordillera of BC and Yukon and in other, similar settings in Mexico, New Zealand and Australia.  The goal of this research is to develop new insights into the nature of tectonism and formation of mineral deposits in continental margin settings from international studies and then apply that new knowledge to better understanding the tectonic evolution of the Canadian Cordillera and the processes that led to formation of mineral deposits.","Natural resources (economic aspects)","University of British Columbia",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�ochimie et g�ochronologie","G�ochimie et g�ochronologie"

"The adult human mind is remarkably flexible, readily able to select particular streams of information from a complex environment and then reconfigure itself for entirely new tasks. It appears that these mental abilities are supported by the coordinated action of complex brain networks, although at present, the organization and function of these networks is not well-understood. One means of gaining insight into the cognitive and brain bases of these abilities is through the study of developmental change. Young children are often strikingly inflexible in their thinking by remaining fixated on particular features of the visual or auditory world when it is no longer appropriate to do so. Understanding the basis of this inflexibility and the neurocognitive changes that occur in development that lend the mind greater flexibility would shed important light on these fundamental issues. The current research programme focuses on the role of active memory in the development of cognitive control. Active memory is what allows us to keep current goals in the forefront of our mind, highlight relevant information in the environment, and attenuate distractors, and may be an important specialization of brain networks that implement control. Through the use of converging cognitive-behavioural and neuroimaging methods, the current programme will test the utility of these ideas both for understanding inflexibility in preschool-aged children as well as developmental changes in control that occur between middle-childhood and early adulthood.",Psychology,"University of Western Ontario",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Science cognitive -- d�veloppement",Psychologie

"In the beginning of the 20th century, scientists realized that the classical framework for physics was wrong. This led to the creation of a new mathematical framework for physics, called quantum mechanics.  A broad array of physical theories have been developed in this new framework and tested with remarkable accuracy. 



By the end of the 20th century, scientists were not just observing quantum phenomena; they were also controlling them with greater and greater precision. This was the beginning of the ""harnessing"" of the quantum world. The degree to which quantum phenomena have been controlled to date is still rather limited in comparison with what we believe is actually possible. One of the greatest challenges of the 21st century will be to fully harness the power of quantum mechanics. We already know some of the consequences, like some unbreakable cryptographic primitives, and efficient solution to some problems widely believed to be intractable on conventional ""classical"" devices. Just as we had very little idea about the applications and impact of classical computers in the 1940s, we likely have only scratched the surface of the capabilities of this fundamentally new form of information processing. 

There are three main themes in my proposed research program, with a strong inter-relationship.

""Quantum Algorithms and Complexity"": The first objective is to continue to discover the capabilities and limitations of quantum computation.

""Quantum Cryptography and Testing"": Another objective is the development of new cryptographic tools that can be used in the next generation information security infrastructure. 

""Implementation of quantum information processing"": Lastly, I plan to apply computer science ideas and approaches to develop more tools that will advance and accelerate the development of scalable quantum information technologies.

"The use of electrical equipment powered from the utility grid is rising dramatically and will continue to do so, mainly due to the demands of an information age. Action must be taken to meet the accompanying demand for energy to avoid dire economic consequences, but there is little desire to build expensive hydro-electric projects or polluting coal plants that contribute to global warning, and more research is needed before ""green"" sources like wind become common. Campaigns such as ""FLICK-OFF"" in Ontario and global events such as Earth Hour have stressed the need to conserve energy and to process it more efficiently. 



Power electronic converters made up of semiconductor devices (switches) and passive elements arranged in electrical circuit structures (topologies) are needed as the interface between source and end application in almost all electrical equipment. Ac-dc power converters are the utility/application interface in most electrical products and equipment. 



New and improved ac-dc converters of low to medium power (< 6 kW) will be investigated for the proposed research. The novelty will be in the originality and improvement in cost and/or efficiency of the proposed alternatives to existing converters. Cost and complexity will be reduced by using topologies that require fewer active switches, and efficiency will be increased using techniques that reduce the power lost in the converter switches when they are turned on and off with high frequency. The results of the research can be used in applications such as power converters for computer, telecom, uninterrupted power supplies, and alternative energy systems. It can be extended to applications where a dc input source is used such as for low power fuel-cell and solar power converters. The proposed research will help strengthen Canadian capabilities in this area and train highly qualified personnel, including 3 Ph.D and 4 Master's students.

"The long-term goal of the program is to derive principles that govern normal and impaired memory and cognition, and to relate them to the organization of brain structure and function in young and old adults.  The medium-range goal is to shift the emphasis from studies which identify and isolate different components of processing to those which examine how they interact. Three lines of research are proposed, the plan being to provide converging evidence from behavioural/cognitive techniques and from functional neuroimaging

1. The effects of memory on attention: Little is known about the relationship between attention and memory at retrieval. Evidence from functional neuroimaging on retrieval implicates the parietal cortex, a primary structure in the attention network . We wish to explore the relation between different memory processes and the two different components of attention, stimulus-driven (inferior parietal cortex) and voluntary (superior parietal cortex) at the behavioral and neuropsychological (fMRI, ERPs) level.

2.The contribution of recollection and the hippocampus to implicit and semantic memory: A quarter century of research has shown that implicit. explicit and semantic memory can operate independently of each other. By focusing on the distinction between the systems, less attention had been paid to how they interact. A series of behavioural and fMRI studies are planned to determine whether recollection, and hippocampal activation, influences the speed and accuracy of decisions on non-episodic memory tasks, such as peceiving, understanding and problem solving, associated with stimuli that give rise to these recollections.

3. Temporal integration in face recognition: Past studies in our laboratory have shown that integration of features and relations into a configural (holistic) representation of faces occurs in a short-term visual buffer which can retain the information for about 400 msec. Using the temporal integration paradigms we developed, we plan to conduct fMRI studies to identify the regions in which this integration occurs so as to enrich our understanding of the neural mechanisms that support configural processing of faces.

"The U-Pb age dating of microminerals such as zircon (ZrSiO4) has become the benchmark technique for calibrating the geologic time scale. The extremely slow volume diffusion properties of zircon, its resistance to chemical breakdown in tectonic and impact processes, its crystallization in a wide range of temperature, pressure and fluid environments, and its occurrence in resource deposits and early solar system materials make it an increasingly important tool for planetary science and resource geology. Processes previously inaccessible to geochronologists are now being quantified through pairing of age information from crystal zones with coincident measurements of stable isotope and trace element composition, and microstructure. Recent progress by Moser's group has laid the foundation for geochronology of high temperature deformation and fluid movement within tectonic plates. The proposed program is designed to develop these new geochronology methods using specialized electron beam techniques in Moser's newly established laboratory. These include multispectral Cathodoluminesence and Electron Backscatter Diffraction to reveal the micro- to nano-scale chemical and structural zoning in U-bearing microcrystals in relation to the host mineral assemblages. This critical material science data will be coupled with ion and laser beam analysis of targeted domains for radiogenic isotope, stable isotope and trace element analysis. This methodology will be applied by Moser's growing team of HQP in a range of earth and planetary science projects many of which involve partnership with the Canadian mineral and exploration industry or support economic development in the North. These include; Earth's oldest rocks and the diamond prospectivity of Arctic Canada, tracing impact melt sources in the mineralized Sudbury and Vredefort impact craters, the evolution of meteorite samples of the lunar crust, and the high precision dating of source strata for fossil fuels in Western Canada. A total of nine graduate students and five senior undergraduate students will be trained to measure ages and rates of planetary processes including those which generated the Canadian lithosphere and its resources.

"There is strong evidence that the rapid rise in global temperatures over the last century is due to the unprecedented increase in greenhouse gases related to human activities. It is less certain how these global changes will affect regional temperature, hydroclimates and aquatic ecosystems. Compounding this uncertainty is the poorly understood synergy of warming temperatures and nutrient enrichment, which results from human activities even, as my research is showing, in areas remote from human occupation. Understanding the climate warming-nutrient synergy is critical as it may have a marked impact on future water quantity and quality. My research program is, therefore, designed to contribute to our knowledge of changing hydroclimates and nutrient enrichment utilizing alpine and northern lake sediments. This program consists of three research themes: 1) Holocene hydroclimate variability at several timescales in the headwater reaches of two drainages in the southern Canadian Rockies; 2) Impacts of climate change and atmospheric nitrogen pollution on remote alpine and northern lakes over the last ca. 100 years, and 3) New paleotemperature measurements of alpine lakes using oxygen isotopes in diatom opaline silica. The geographic targets lie along a broad transect from the northern boreal forest of the Canadian Northwest Territories to alpine regions of the US Intermountain West. This research will be supported by the analytical facilities of the newly equipped Lake and Reservoir System Research Facility (LARSRF) that I have developed at the University of Western Ontario over the last two years. This facility hosts a wide range of state-of-the-art equipment to document and evaluate natural and anthropogenic impacts on water resources. The full achievement of the proposed research goals is reasonable in the timeframe described given my 70% research effort associated with my NSERC-UFA position, the excellence of the LARSRF facilities and my successful track record of recruiting and training HQP. My proposed research program will continue and promote the collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to the analyses of lake environments that has characterized my work.",Environment,"University of Western Ontario",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�ographie physique","G�ographie physique"

"Because genes work together in groups or networks to perform their functions, gene activity is tightly controlled, such that genes are only active at the appropriate time and place. For example, a gene involved in lactose digestion might be active in the stomach and not the eye, after eating cheese and not at night. Changes in the control of gene activity can therefore change biological processes; these changes can lead to biological diversity between species or individuals, but also to disease if they disrupt normal function.  In particular, cancer is often the result of improper activity of genes that control cell division, allowing uncontrolled growth of tumor cells.

  Although in recent years complete genome sequences have provided a complete catalogue of the genes, for most genes we have little understanding of how their activity is regulated. Systematically understanding how genes are regulated and how this regulation is specified by the genome is one of the major current challenges in molecular biology. 

  The goal of this research is to understand how regulation evolves. Understanding the evolution of gene regulation will enable us to better understand how gene regulation is encoded in the genome. In the long term this research will provide a general picture of the forces that shape the evolution of gene regulation, as well as provide specific examples of critical regulatory changes at different levels of regulation.  These studies will provide estimates of the contribution of natural selection to changes in transcriptional regulation, which will involve developing new statistical and computational methods and these will be made available to the community. In addition, although gene regulation is of great medical and biological importance, little is known about its evolution.  These studies will provide examples of evolutionary changes in regulation, and test the hypothesis that changes in regulation can contribute to evolutionary diversity.

"Human learning and problem solving can be accomplished using multiple cognitive strategies, which are supported by different neural networks.  Neural processing is, undoubtedly, driven by complex genetic interactions, however an understanding of the link between these levels of analysis is lacking. This research program will examine the genetic and neural bases of individual tendencies to use different congitive strategies, and how how these different levels interact to affect observable behaviour. This proposal entails three experiments, each incorporating increasingly complex combinations of variables that will be analyzed using the partial least squares (PLS) multivariate statistical approach.  Experiment 1 will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine how individuals' cognitive strategy affects their performance and brain activation during a problem solving task.  Experiment 2 will investigate the impact of a select group of candidate genes on brain activation, cognitive strategy and problem solving peformance.  Experiment 3 will relate variance across multiple genes simultaneously with brain activation patterns, cognitive strategy and behavioural performance.  This proposal represents a collaboration among neuroscientists, psychiatrists and geneticists from the Hospital for Sick Children, the Rotman Research Institute, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and the University of Toronto.  This project incorporates a powerful combination of genetics, neuroimaging, cognition and behaviour into a single analysis using cutting-edge statistical techniques.  This multidisciplinary approach will provide a unified conceptualization of how genes, brain activity and cognition interact to produce individual differences in learning skills and problem solving abilities.

"Recent years have witnessed an explosion of research and development efforts aimed at harnessing the unique properties of nanoscopic systems. This has led to a nanotechnology industry that is expected to grow to multi-trillion dollar levels (worldwide) over the next few years. The development of functional nanomaterials - nanoscopic structures that can be fine-tuned at the atomic-level to exhibit well-defined electrical, chemical, or physical responses to external stimuli - is a key driver of research in this industry because the ability to exert detailed control over the behaviour of these materials has the potential to lead to breakthroughs in areas ranging from catalysis and medicine to lubrication and energy production. For example, the development of nanoscopic coatings that respond to applied loads by becoming harder will dramatically improve our ability to protect surfaces from wear, while designing molecular cages that undergo chemical decomposition at specific surface sites will lead to improved means of selectively delivering drugs to cells. Chemical modeling provides an attractive means of gaining atomic-level insights that can be used to accelerate the development of functional nanomaterials. However, despite the proven capabilities of computational chemistry in many areas of research, the application of simulation methods to complex systems such as functional nanomaterials remains a significant challenge. The overall goal of this research program is to establish chemical simulation as a practical tool for guiding the rational development of functional nanomaterials. This will be achieved by developing cutting-edge simulation methods that are capable of accurately describing the properties and behaviour of complex chemical systems, and using these methods to shed light on fundamental details pertaining to the formation, properties, and behaviour of functional nanomaterials. This work will facilitate breakthroughs in the large number of fields that are impacted by nanotechnology, contribute to recent efforts to develop strong nanoscience research and development capabilities within Canada, and provide students with opportunities to gain the skills necessary to develop, implement, and apply simulation methods.

"The leakage power consumed by said caches is substantial and therefore an interesting target for power reduction. Currently, the cache sizes are generally chosen to provide high performance under worst case load conditions. The power management approaches that are currently in uses generally focus on waiting for the caches and surrounding blocks to become fully idle, at which time the caches are flushed and powered down.



The central thesis of this research proposal is that the ability to adaptively vary cache size (by power gating pieces of the cache) based on the needs of a given work-load can provide substantial average power and possibly TDP (thermal design power) savings at the expense of limited performance loss. Confirming the above thesis and, if confirmed, recommending an approach is a complicated task and one that needs to be performed on a case by case basis: CPU caches, Graphics core sub-block caches and Server Northbridge TLBs service widely different access patterns and each case needs to be evaluated independently.



In addition to dynamic cache sizing (which, for example, can take the form of resizing the number of sets  or ways ), additional leakage reduction techniques can be of benefit. These include: (1) dynamic cache decay where cache lines are powered off after a period of inactivity, (2) dynamic cache sub-blocking  where not all the data of a cache block is allocated in the cache, (3) zero  and frequent pattern compression where frequent values and patterns are encoded in the cache to take up less space, (4) common-prefix compression for tags that reduces the amount of space required to store tags, (5) more effective cache replacement policies that increase the hit rate and the effectiveness of the cache, and (5) alternate SRAM designs that reduce leakage by exploiting data liveness and content.



Benefits:



-Gaining substantial competitive edge by reducing average power consumption in many products using methods that are not currently in wide use within the industry.

-Transfer of technology expertise in computer architecture design methodologies to AMD and to the University.

-Forming a, hopefully, permanent collaborative relationship with a recognized expert in low power computer architecture.

-Foster the training of highly skilled people building towards a critical mass of highly-skilled computer architects (an area of expertise that Ontario and Canada is lacking).

-Strengthen the expertise and value of the AMD Markham site.

"At the core of virtually all modern electronic devices such as computers, cell phones, and network routers there is at least one processor that is the ""brains"" of the device. Processors manipulate information represented as numbers. Processors are extremely useful because they can interact with the environment - via sensors (e.g., a microphone) and actuators (e.g., a speaker) - following a prespecified, yet complex, set of actions. Processors are also extremely useful in scientific exploration as they can evaluate complex models of physical phenomena such as chemical, biological and inter-planetary interactions that are too expensive or impractical to study otherwise. Today many everyday activities and much of scientific exploration rely on the availability of optimized, inexpensive processors. Historically, it was possible to continuously improve the performance and other characteristics of processors (e.g., energy consumption) while reducing cost. A typical computer in the early 80's cost several tens of thousands, while today just a few hundred dollars while being 1000 times as powerful. Much of the communications and computing industry relies on this trend. A key mechanism for improving processors is computer architecture, which studies how to build processors given the available manufacturing technologies while taking into consideration the applications that these processors will be used for. Computer architecture faces continuous challenges for two reasons: (1) the properties of the underlying technology change significantly over time, and (2) so do the applications. This research is targeted at improving processors by addressing new challenges that stem from the continuous shrinking of the underlying manufacturing technology and the new applications that have emerged as processor-based devices have become ubiquitous. The challenges addressed include performance, design complexity, and energy consumption. Such techniques must be developed if the historical trends of advance in processor performance and cost are to be maintained. A variety of processor-based devices ranging from smart-phones to supercomputers will benefit from this research.

"All-optical signal processing devices are absolutely critical for current and future high speed optical communications systems as well as defence systems where the channel bit rates or carrier frequencies are much faster than electronic processing speeds, or where electronic signal processing is prohibitively expensive. Current state of the art fibre-optic transmission systems have reached the 10 Tera-bit per second (10^12 bits/s) range, with individual channels having speeds of 40Gb/s in commercial systems and 160Gb/s and even 640Gb/s in research labs. These bit rates are already well beyond the reach of electronic device processing speeds. My research program at INRS-EMT will focus on developing novel integrated nanophotonic structures and devices in both new and established materials, for all optical signal processing at ultra high speeds for communications systems and other applications such as sensing and defence. I will pioneer novel structures including  (i) nanowires (ii) photonic crystals (iii) ring resonators in both novel materials such as (i) chalcogenide glasses as well as (ii) silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and (iii) III-V compound semiconductors (AlGaAs and InP). The aim will be to achieve advanced all optical signal processing functions such as signal regeneration (both 2R and 3R), wavelength conversion, optical performance monitoring, switching, demultiplexing, amplification, and other functions, based on 2nd  and 3rd order nonlinearities such as Raman Gain, self-phase modulation, four wave mixing and others.  This research program will have multi-fold benefits to Canada, including addressing the immediate and future needs of the Canadian photonics and telecommunications industry, the establishment of INRS in particular as a world-leader in nanophotonics, as well as the training of highly qualified personnel to respond to the future technological needs of our society.

"Embryonic development represents the first steps of new life. During embryogenesis a single cell, the egg, reorganizes into a complex structure resembling the adult animal. By the end of embryogenesis the head, eyes, vertebral column and arms and legs of the animals are all clearly discernable. It is, then, during embryogenesis that our body plan is defined. The earliest stage of this process requires cell movements that produce three fundamental tissue layers, that giving rise to the skin, nervous system and brain, thoat giving rise to the muscles and the skeleton, and finally that giving the internal organs such as the lungs, stomach and intestines. This earliest stage of embryogenesis is precisely controlled in order to exactly position one layer of tissue over the other. To do this, each tissue layer must understand exactly what the other is doing and this is achieved by signaling molecules that pass between the layers. We are trying to understand exactly how these signaling molecules are received and how they change the movement of cells within each tissue layer. Errors in the reception of these signals lead to important malformations, often affecting closing of the neural tube (open back). Such malformations known as Spina bifida and Anencephaly are among the most common birth defects in humans, accounting for 1 birth in a 1000. The studies we are making of the early stages of embryogenesis will, therefore, have repercussions on our understanding of why such serious birth defects occur.","Advancement of knowledge","Universit� Laval",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Biologie animale","Biologie animale"

"POLARIS (Portable Observatories for Lithospheric Analysis and Research Investigating Seismicity) is a major national research infrastructure that consists of satellite-linked arrays of portable geophysical observatories. These state-of-the-art observatories enable Canadian scientists to probe Earth's interior with unprecedented resolution, enabling innovative studies of Earth structure and dynamics, and improving our knowledge of earthquake and geomagnetic hazards. POLARIS deployments include 100 satellite-linked broadband seismograph systems, 10 with continuous-recording magnetotelluric (MT) devices, plus an inventory of more than 70 portable MT and seismic observatories for campaign-style investigations. These systems record ground motions and electromagnetic signals that reveal the geophysical characteristics of the subsurface. Data from POLARIS observatories are transmitted via satellite to acquisition centres in London (Canada) and Ottawa, where they are made available in near real-time to researchers across Canada. The improved imaging capability of POLARIS, combined with innovative interpretive techniques, lays the groundwork for breakthroughs and significant economic benefits for Canada in several geoscience disciplines. Our fledgling diamond industry, already adding millions of dollars to the national economy per year, exploits POLARIS-led advances, since diamonds are formed in the deep roots of continents; a clearer understanding of their journey to the surface could have economic implications in the multi-billion dollar range. Potential losses in the event of a large earthquake near a major urban centre in Canada could have a similar economic impact, not to mention the potential loss of life. Dangers are significantly reduced through knowledge of earthquake risk, a prerequisite for mitigation. Because ground motions are monitored in near-real time, information on earthquake motions and damage potential is available within minutes of an earthquake occurrence.","Earth sciences","Carleton University",1,"MRSIF ","Major Resources Support Program - Infrastructure","G�ophysique","G�ophysique"
"It is well accepted that pollutants including radiation are seldom present as lone agents in the environment, yet very little research is available looking at combined exposures which include radiation. This may be because the regulators treat chemicals and radiation completely separately. Given the likelihood of a nuclear renaissance, and the increasing use of radioactive imaging agents in medicine, it is essential to get information about potential hazards in this area. New data in the field strongly suggest that effects of very low doses of radiation (genomic instability and bystander effects associated with cellular oxidative stress), both impact on environmental health and are modulated by associated metal exposures. Neurochemicals such as dopamine and serotonin also modulate low dose radiation effects. Commonly used pesticides often contain antagonists to these neurochemicals and water recycled from human waste management also contains trace but detectable amounts of neurochemicals and radioactive imaging agents. We have evidence to suggest that these chemicals will interfere with normal stress responses eliciting inappropriate reactions at the cell, tissue and organism level. There is also concern that studying individual responses will not address impacts at higher hierarchical levels such as that of the population or ecosystem. Finally the experiments address issues such as stress associated adaptation of individuals within populations which provide an evolutionary mechanism at the species level in times of rapid or extreme environmental change. Our laboratory is well experienced in the design of experiments to address these important questions. 



    The specific objectives of this application are to investigate the role of very low dose non-targeted radiation effects using fish as a very appropriate and relevant model system, with particular emphasis on the interactions between other stressors such as heavy metals and neurochemical antagonists.

"The general objective of my research program has been to increase our understanding of how people represent spatial relations in memory and how people use spatial memory in navigation.  My previous research showed that people tend to represent objects' locations with respect to an allocentric reference direction inside the layout when the objects are lined up forming a regular layout.  I intend to ask whether that will still happen when people learn a layout of randomly placed objects in which any external cues are removed.  Several studies in the literature showed that recognizing novel views in scenes was more accurate when the novel test view was caused by observer locomotion than when it was caused by scene rotation.  In the proposed research, the spatial reference direction will be indicated via a marker in the scene rotation condition but not in the observer location condition.  The goal is to see if recognition performance in the scene rotation condition becomes comparable to that in the observer locomotion condition.  I will also investigate how people reorient after disorientation.  My previous research showed that when participants learned a layout of irregularly placed objects, their pointing consistency across objects decreased after disorientation.  In the proposed research, after disorientation, participants will be told either their facing direction or their original learning direction.  The goal is to examine whether disorientation effect will disappear in either condition.  The proposed research should advance our understanding of how people represent locations of objects and how they use spatial memory during navigation. This is an important real-world skill in many contexts.  The proposed research will elaborate and constrain theoretical models of spatial memory and navigation, both my own and those of others.  It should also help our understanding the roles of the reference direction, viewpoint change, and locomotion in recognizing scenes, shapes, and objects.  Hence, the findings should be informative in forming a universal model of visual processing in 3D environments.

"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) provides network operators with a strong tool in traffic engineering and abundant Classes of Service (CoS), and has been well recognized as the best candidate for the next generation IP-centric carrier networks. One of the most important functions supported by GMPLS is its ability in performance multilayer protection and restoration such that the End-to-End (E2E) service availability of each Label Switched Path (LSP) could be guaranteed according to the service level agreement (SLA). The previously reported studies on service availability and survivability have mostly focused on the efficiency in the redundancy allocation upon a specific protection scheme or under the consideration of a given number of simultaneous failures in networks. A general framework for survivable routing and spare capacity allocation that can best address the availability-aware design, however, has never been reported. Thus, this project is committed to solve this problem by bringing up a group of researchers and engineers, to introduce and investigate novel availability-aware survivable routing architecture under the framework of GMPLS-based recovery.

"In recent years, advances in miniaturization; low-power circuit design; simple, low power, yet reasonably efficient wireless communication equipment; and improved small-scale energy supplies have combined with reduced manufacturing costs to make a new technological vision possible: Wireless sensor networks. A sensor network is composed of a large number of sensor/actuator nodes, which are densely deployed either inside the phenomenon or very close to it. The position of nodes need not be engineered or pre-determined. This allows random deployment in inaccessible terrains or disaster relief operation. The aim is to develop and facilitate the use of scalable and modular wireless heterogeneous sensor/actuator networks in the e-Society. The objective of this project is to develop network architectures along with supporting protocols and algorithms and network control mechanisms for supporting sensors/actuators networking via different types of wireless networks. To support these new architectures, self organized algorithms, new power efficient protocols, novel gateway designs, robust mobility management techniques, and new radio resource management frameworks, are required. Depending on the application, one or more wireless network technologies, such as WiMax, WiFi, ad hoc networks, along with wireless mesh, Internet access and cellular systems would be deployed. The research will focus on four issues: i) Architecture and system design; ii) Gateways and internetworking; iii) Mobility and radio resource management; iv) Self organized and distributed systems. Performance evaluation methods for various architectures, protocols, algorithms, strategies, frameworks, and novel techniques will be carried out using analytical and simulation approaches as well as actual emulation and lab measurements.

"The virtual worlds found in computer-generated films and computer games are populated by characters, objects, and landscapes that are created by skilled digital artists. Although computational tools are available to create simple virtual scenery in the form of hills, trees, and mountains, the creators of virtual worlds want fantastical effects. In the movie Cars, for example, the world was designed with a car-centred aesthetic: flowers resembled tailfins, and mountains resembled hubcaps. Virtual worlds are populated by strange, alien scenery and by the remnants of antiquity: gnarled trees bristle with spirits, and ruined temples sprawl hidden behind every hill.



This project will extend the range of computer-generated scenery to include stylized natural scenery and historical human-made artifacts. Computers will create trees which resemble human faces when seen from precisely the right angle, and mountains which reveal ancient writing when the sun shines from exactly the right direction. They will produce sculptures, architectural adornments, mosaics, and all manner of other artworks. The computational tools created by this project will allow artists to create ever more vivid, complex, and engaging virtual worlds for the digital entertainments of the future.

"In this research program I consider Multi-Actor Dynamic Spatial Situations (MADSS) that involve a large number of actors acting in geographic spaces of various extents. Decision makers from governmental and private sectors need to monitor the evolution of MADDSs in order to make informed decisions in order to insure human security, equipment preservation and the respect of public order. Although there exist GIS-based data collection and data fusion systems, most available civilian MADDS management systems lack simulation tools that can be used by emergency teams and managers for rehearsal purposes and training. During the past 7 years I showed that multi-agent geo-simulation (MAGS) may provide such tools. I developed with my team a MAGS approach and a simulation framework to simulate MADSSs, as well as tools to analyse and compare simulation outputs. We applied this approach and tools in various domains: 1) crowd simulations; 2) customers' shopping behaviours in malls; 3) the spread of the West Nile Virus; to name a few. However, there is still a lack of tools to help decision makers to qualitatively specify scenarios and assess simulation outputs at the levels of detail they need. Fundamentally, this research program, articulated around 3 main goals, aims at addressing two main requirements: 1) the need to explicitly introduce models of individuals/groups/populations and to simulate their interactions in MAGS; 2) the need to represent/describe/analyse situations at different levels of detail and in a qualitative way that suits decision makers' assessment/reasoning/planning activities using incomplete and approximate information. To address the first requirement, I propose to enhance our MAGS method/tools using a holonic approach that provides appropriate mechanisms for the explicit representation and flexible organization of individuals and groups (Goal1). To address the 2nd requirement, I propose to adapt Zadeh's Computational Theory of Perceptions (CTP) and Granular Computing (GC) to MAGS (Goal 2). The third goal is to exploit/refine the Holonic MAGS+CTP+GC framework and associated tools and to develop new decision support systems for MAGS in selected application domains.

"According to the World Health Organization, obesity has reached epidemic proportions with 300 millions of them clinically obese. Obesity and overweight pose a major risk for serious diet-related chronic diseases, including type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain forms of cancer. Obesity is a very complex problem and does not appear to be only a consequence of our way of life. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of this metabolic disease is important in the aim to find new therapy avenues.

Our increasing understanding of the pathogenesis of obesity has revealed a strong link between this disorder and de novo lipid synthesis (lipogenesis). Among the enzymes involved in lipogenesis, Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS) has been showed to be a crucial biosynthetic enzyme. In the present research program, we propose to characterize the molecular mechanisms regulating the FAS gene expression in response to hormones and nutrients. FAS is up-regulated by triiodothyronine (T3) and insulin and down-regulated by glucagon and medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs).  

We have previously demonstrated that both insulin and triiodothyronine (T3), two diet-induced hormones, up regulate the FAS gene expression and the FAS enzymatic activity in chick embryo hepatocytes. The precise mechanism of these hormonal (insulin and T3) actions remains however to be characterize. We propose to identify the molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression of the FAS gene analysing the regulatory region of the gene (promoter).

We have also demonstrated that a medium chain fatty acid (hexanoate:C6) is able to specifically down-regulate insulin and T3-induced FAS gene expression. This may be of great interest in the aim to develop nutrient additives to decrease diet-induced obesity. We will therefore characterize the mechanism of the MCFA action and identified the metabolite that is responsible for the inhibition of FAS transcription.

"Bacteria interact with their environment using specialized molecules. Recently, it has become apparent that some of these molecules, proteins, bear modifications that once were thought to be restricted to animal cells: glycosylation, or the addition of sugar residues at isolated sites in the protein. Very little is known about these modifications in bacteria, but many animal and human proteins need the modifications to perform their function and the modifications require complex pathways of multiple enzymes. In addition, the inability to glycosylate animal or human proteins recombinantly expressed in bacteria is often blamed for the failure to biotechnologically produce these valuable proteins.

We are studying an adhesin identified in some strains of the bacterium Escherichia coli that cause diarrhea in animals and humans. This adhesin enables the bacterium to attach itself to the intestinal cells of its animal and human hosts, where it can then cause diarrhea. We have recently observed that this adhesin is glycosylated. We have shown that the modification requires a single enzyme and that glycosylation is indispensable for the bacterium to adhere to animal cells.

In the proposed study, we will examine the enzyme that causes this modification of the adhesin. We will characterize several aspects of the structure and mechanism of action of the enzyme by mutating it, as well as by purifying it and reconstituting in a test tube the reaction it mediates.

This knowledge will yield a better fundamental understanding of a still poorly understood process. It will additionally characterize a new putative target for the development of anti-infective drugs. Lastly, these studies might be used to produce proteins of interest that are glycosylated, and thus overcome a bottleneck in the recombinant production of some proteins.

"The proposed research in biomedical computing is aimed at developing innovative methods to support prediction and characterization of complex biological phenomena. The new era of large-scale biology is characterized by insurmountable amounts of data including high throughput genomic data, large public databases, medical images and clinical signals. This abundance of data stands in contrast to the limited knowledge about the biological events underlying disease. This research includes the development of feature extraction methods to examine multi-modal biomedical data (high-throughput gene expression, Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI], ultrasound signals), and computational models to integrate identified features and explain disease processes. The developed methods are discussed in the framework of two major disorders, prostate cancer and Multiple Sclerosis [MS], to serve as examples; however, they can be extended to apply to other biological processes. 



The unparalleled integrative approach proposed in this research, that uses features from multiple-modalities (MRI and gene expression), and clinical information, enables formulate accurate models of MS progression. Such models, can help with early diagnosis of disease, and facilitate the discovery of new drugs and the realization of personalized medicine. In addition, the novel approaches to acquisition and analysis of ultrasound signals has the ultimate potential to accelerate the rate of early detection of cancer, specifically the diagnostic grade without the need for biopsy. This advance will result in improved clinical management of cancer and can reduce mortality rates drastically. 



Training of highly qualified personnel is a primary focus of this work; three PhD and four Master's students, as well as five summer undergraduates will be involved in the proposed research.","Biomedical engineering","Queen's University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Technologie de l'information","Technologie de l'information"

"Automobile accidents, earthquakes, sports injuries and other causes claim every year thousands of new victims who end up with part of their nerve system damaged resulting in specific lack of motor functionality or sensory capabilities. Depending on the type of the injury, treatments focus on compensating for the loss of specific motor control capabilities or sensory modality. They can be categorized as rehabilitation methodologies to help patients cope with their injury rather than restoring them to their pre-injury state. In this proposal we are interested in a different approach where the damaged nerves are replaced with artificial microsystems that mimic the information processing of biological nerves and not just its functional role. We are particularly interested in applications related to spinal cord injuries.



In this context, an implanted microsystem would transfer electroneurographic (ENG) signals across a lesion such that the information processing functionality of the original nerve would be restored. Naturally that would also lead to restoration of the motor or sensory functionality. Current implants have well documented functional behavior that does not change or adapt to individual users and changes in their bodies. We are interested in the long term in developing adaptive microsystems that adapt over time to changes in the body just as biological nerves do. The impact of such developments should not be understated. In the short term, the objectives of this proposal is to develop new microelectrodes using shape memory alloys (smart material) and implementation of artificial neural networks on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).","Biomedical engineering","University of Guelph",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Syst�mes d'apprentissage adaptatifs et �volutifs","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"
"This proposal request funding for purchasing of Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) system that has the capability of characterizing the 3D Micro/NANO Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS/NEMS) dynamics at high frequency. Several research projects in our group and the University of Alberta will utilize the requested equipments including, dynamic characterization of energy harvesting MEMS/NEMS based devices using ambient vibrations surrounding an aging biomedical, and mechanical, aerospace, civil or environmental system. Our group is involved in a number of other projects that include MEMS/NEMS actuators at high resonance frequency, such as structurally modified Radio Frequency switch toward the reduction of skin effect at high frequency (20 MHz). Laser Doppler Vibrometry is a widely accepted tool for dynamic characterization of MEMS/NEMS. Using automated scan capability, LDV can measure structural resonance and display out-of-plane deflection shapes with amplitudes down to the picometer level and frequencies to 30 MHz. This LDV is presently being used throughout the MEMS/NEMS community to characterize the dynamics of micro-devices such as optical switches, vibrating cantilevers, membranes, actuators, motors, micro-optics and torsional oscillators. Applications for Laser Vibrometry measurements include: (1) Dynamic testing of device response to determine mechanical parameters such as resonant frequency, stiffness and damping, (2) Characterization of device response during design development and release processes, (3) Validate design performance versus expected FEA model predictions, (4) Determine reliability under mechanical excitation (wire bonding, environmental vibration and shock), radiation, temperature, humidity and pressure stress by targeting device inside environmental or vacuum chamber and (5) Calibrate actuator and sensor displacements versus drive voltage over wide range of movements down to nano meter scale.

"Swallowing is among the most complicated acts of the human body.  Even a slight delay or mismatch in the sequence of swallowing events may allow food aspiration into the lung and causes appreciable morbidity and mortality.  Especially in the elderly and in patients with disabilities, stroke, head-neck or spinal cord injuries, swallowing disorders are quite common. To assess swallowing disorders, patients are generally observed with a special X-ray (videofluroscopy) during feeding. Since our recent studies have shown promising diagnostic capabilities of swallowing sound analysis, we propose here to investigate other methods for swallowing assessment using acoustical analysis. Using available manometry data of the esophageal pressure in correspondence to videoflouroscopic images and swallowing sounds, we will develop a comprehensive structural model for the swallowing mechanism and model the acoustic signatures of specific swallowing events. We will validate and test our model with data obtained in both healthy subjects and patients. We hypothesize that some of the model's parameters, i.e. those that represent the muscle force or the timing between structural movements, will be significantly different between the two groups, and hence provide a means to explore objectively the cause of swallowing disorders. We also propose to develop a prototype of an integrated and modular system to acquire, denoise, analyze, and screen swallowing and breath sound signals, and to use wireless technology to transfer data to a remote clinical diagnostic center. 

The work proposed here will simplify relevant clinical assessments and contribute to better understanding of swallowing dysfunction.  Also, this work will provide objective means to aid physicians in determining which deficiency in the dysphagic patient needs to be addressed and treated.  Our proposed program will contribute to establishing Canada in the exciting and rapidly expanding field of telemedicine in general, and acoustical analysis of swallowing mechanisms in particular, and will directly benefit everyone involved.

However, many subfields of materials science remain out-of-reach of simulation, generally because they involve phenomena occurring on a wide range of spatial or time scale, or both.  Over the last few years, I have developed, in collaboration with other researchers, new algorithms and software packages that will allow us to expand the applicability of simulations to some of these problems.  In this proposal, I focus on two areas: (i) the simulation of activated processes associated with diffusion at interfaces and defect aggregation, using the recently proposed kinetic activation-relaxation technique (kinetic ART), an on-the-fly off-lattice self-learning kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm and (ii) the simulation of the protein aggregation process leading to the formation of toxic amyloid structures associated with degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.","Materials sciences","Universit� de Montr�al",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Physique de la mati�re condens�e","Physique de la mati�re condens�e"

"Responsive materials exhibit unique physical responses under static or variable applied forces or fields. Combination of such physical responses with outstanding mechanical properties of solid-state phases yields functional materials that find applications both at the industrial and consumer levels. The research will focus on two areas of responsive solid-state materials, magnetocaloric and thermoelectric phases. Magnetocaloric materials respond by changing their temperature when the magnetic field is varied and, thus, can be used for magnetic cooling. Thermoelectric materials generate voltage when subject to a temperature gradient  or perform cooling/heating when current is passed through them. Our short-term research goals are to design, synthesize and characterize novel high-performance magnetocaloric and thermoelectric phases. By pursuing these goals, we want to attain a better understanding of the intimate relationship between a crystal structure, physical properties and electronic structure in solid-state materials. We also want to develop bonding principles that govern their structures and to use the acquired knowledge for materials design. Responsive materials are well suited for such studies, as the correlation between the crystal structure, valence electron concentration and physical properties can be monitored through a variety of techniques and approaches.

In the magnetocaloric field, we will pursue synthesis of new polar intermetallic materials, in which ferromagnetic ordering is coupled to a structural transition at or near room temperature. Among the thermoelectric materials, we will focus on the synthesis of so-called ""electron-crystal phonon-glass"" materials. Such materials are good electrical conductors, while their thermal conductivity is very low and is approaching that of amorphous materials. While being somewhat different, the two projects will share common synthetic approaches, utilize the same toolkit for structural and elemental analyses and rely on electronic structure calculations to understand bonding features and structure stability. The two projects also have the same strategic goal, i.e. to relate the crystal structure to the electronic structure and physical properties.

"Every cubic centimeter of air contains hundreds to over a hundred thousand fine particles with diameters less than one micrometer. These particles can absorb and scatter sunlight and also act as the nuclei on which cloud droplets form. As a result, they play a major role in climate; our incomplete knowledge of how these particles form is a major cause of uncertainty in global climate models. It has also been demonstrated that these particles have a significant negative impact on human health. Fine particles are largely formed by a process called gas-to-particle conversion in which gases, such as sulfur dioxide, aromatic hydrocarbons (from petroleum products) and terpenes (emitted by plants) undergo reactions that convert them to compounds, such as sulfuric acid and oxygenated organic compounds, that form solid and liquid particles.



The gas-to-particle conversion process for organic compounds is still only partially understood in spite of a great deal of research. This is due to both the great complexity of these processes and the difficulty of measuring many of the chemical compounds formed in these reactions. The work to be undertaken in this project will be a new approach towards studying these reactions; it is intended that this will add significant new understanding. Normally, the first step in studying systems like these is to isolate and identify the various chemical compounds that are formed. We will instead obtain high time resolution mass spectra of the entire assembly of compounds and use statistical techniques to decompose these into various ""components"" that each vary in time in a different manner. The idea is that these statistical methods permit the extraction of maximum information from the data. We will then use the methods of chemical kinetics to characterize the time dependencies of the components. This will place the components in a context of chemical reactivity, which will be useful in eventually identifying the chemical compounds that correspond to each component.

"This proposal is for the purchase of a Perkin-Elmer (P-E) Flow Injection Analysis System (FIAS-400) for sample introduction, matrix modification and hydride generation that will be interfaced to our P-E/SciEx Elan DRC-plus ICP-MS. This accessory is required to circumvent some of the analytical difficulties that impede the progress of the research programs of at least four of the instrument's users and their students. These analytical difficulties arise because of the high total dissolved solid content of their field and experimental solutions. Direct injection of these solutions leads to clogging of the injector, severe charge-matrix effects in the interface region and coating of the inlet cones to the mass spectrometer, reducing sensitivity/precision and increasing backgrounds. The research programs that would benefit from this research tool include ongoing studies on the development and impact of oxygen-depleted (hypoxic) bottom waters in the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary and Gulf, paleo-oxygenation reconstruction in shelf and slope sediments, and an investigation of the transport of metals in ore-forming hydrothermal systems, particularly the role of vapour-transport in those of magmatic origin.

More specifically, Mr. Qiang Chen and Mrs. Stelly Lefort (Ph.D. students under the co-supervision of Mucci and Sundby) are investigating the geochemistry of, respectively,  redox-sensisitive metals (Mo, U, Cd, Re, V) and metalloids (As, Se) to identify spatial variations of the redox-state and elemental mobilities/sequestration within marine sediments of the hypoxic waters of the  St. Lawrence. Similarly, Galbraith will be using Ba as a proxy of organic matter accumulation in marine sediments. Williams-Jones' research program is, in large part, devoted to investigating the transport of metals in ore-forming hydrothermal systems. Several of his students are involved in field-based and experimental projects designed to determine whether or not the vapour phase plays a significant role in the transport of base (Cu, Co, Mo) and precious metals (Au, REE) and their role in ore deposit genesis.

"My research focuses on the mechanisms and rates of biogeochemical processes and my approach is a blend of controlled laboratory experiments, modeling, and field studies. The proposed research will be carried out at two spatial scales: the molecular/interfacial scale (surface chemistry of carbonate minerals) and macroscopic scale (sediment diagenesis) but both programs are intimately related. In the first program, the objective is to develop a mechanistic model capable of predicting: 1) the sorption behaviour of carbonate minerals under a variety of environmental conditions and 2) the kinetics of reaction (dissolution/precipitation) of these minerals. The surfaces of carbonate minerals are highly reactive and determine the concentration and mobility of trace elements in a variety of aquatic environments (e.g., carbonate aquifers, marine sediments, mine tailings). Despite their environmental significance (remediation and proxies for paleoenvironmental reconstructions) and broad industrial applications, including the recent thrust in CO2 mineral sequestration strategies, many aspects of the reactivity of carbonate minerals in aqueous solutions have yet to be elucidated. 

The goals of the second program are to identify factors that control elemental fluxes across the sediment-water interface and their impact on the quality of the environment, as well as devise new tools to better exploit the sedimentary record in reconstructions of the history of past environments. As particles settle through the water column, they participate in, and are subjected to, a number of biogeochemical processes including scavenging and bacterial remineralization. Consequently, these particles carry elements to the sediment as well as fuel microbial processes and elemental recycling. Their elemental reactivity and mobility in sediments determine the extent of chemical modifications of the sediment. This program will focus on the behaviour of selected redox-sensitive elements (e.g. Mo, U, and Re) in sediments, how and how fast they accumulate in sediment under various conditions of oxygenation and how their distribution in the sediment can be used to reconstruct the conditions of past depositional environments.

"The Black Sea-Mediterranean Corridor is a region of interconnected marine basins extending from the Black Sea to Eastern Mediterranean, at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Since 2001, the Geological Survey Canada - Memorial University team has shown that marine palynology (study of pollen, freshwater and marine plankton spores) is the best tool to study links between climate records, archeology, and marine archives of temperature, salinity and productivity. Our studies are Canada's contribution to a United Nations program analyzing impacts of climate and sea level change on humans, and showing how regional hydrogeology affects global water cycles, salinity and heat transport in the North Atlantic. This research is vital because on both global and regional scale, changes in Earth's water cycle are the greatest challenge to society. Data from our studies are needed by Canadian climate scientists to validate computer models of ocean-atmosphere interactions. A new graduate-student project will study calcareous algal spores in the Corridor to constrain temperature and salinity estimates for 20,000-100,000 yr-long records of climate before and after human alteration of landscapes. Deep basins of the Corridor contain organic-rich sapropels, the precursors of gas and petroleum-producing black shales. Continental and marine sediments in the Marmara and Aegean Seas offer unparalled opportunity to study processes leading to oil/gas formation. Another graduate-student project will examine Aegean cores at the interface of northern trade- and southern monsoon-wind systems and analyze Marmara, Aegean and Nile records to show how atmospheric forcing and river flooding trigger sapropel formation. Outcomes will be decadal-scale pollen records tracing the history of monsoons and Nile floods, and new data on plankton production and salinity. Our new methods and access to international databases will provide insight to debates about flooding vs. carbon production export, and provide a wide range of test environments to refine climate predictions derived from Canada's palynology database. The sapropel studies will also benefit Canada's search for new offshore fuel resources.","Land, solid earth, seabeds and ocean floors","Memorial University of Newfoundland",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Sciences de la terre (voir aussi g�ologie marine, 4604)","Sciences de la terre"

"The long term objective of my research programme is to be able to create computing environments in which humans can intuitively interact, comprehend complex behaviour and relationships more easily through suitable visualisations, and productively collaborate to accomplish real worlds tasks efficiently. Rapid advances in sensor based data acquisition, real time data logging and voluminous data from complex simulations have led to the situation that data sizes grow much faster than advances in graphics hardware acceleration or in algorithmic techniques. Most 3D processing, rendering and visualization techniques do not scale to these data sizes, certainly not with standard commodity hardware. New computational techniques that can efficiently process and enable 3D visualization of very large and complex data sets are essential. The proposed research directly builds on my previous work during my tenure in India (until 2002), and more specifically on the research programme and collaborations initiated after joining Concordia in 2002. With funding support from NSERC, CFI and other agencies, over the last 4 years I have set up the ""Advanced 3D Graphics and Visual Computing Laboratory"" at Concordia. This lab is currently equipped with a two-head 3D scanner, virtual and augmented reality devices, a powerful 3D graphics cluster and a suite of high end graphics workstations. Specifically, we shall investigate: 1)Computational techniques for closely coupling visualisation with macro-level feature/pattern discovery techniques applicable to large data sets; this forms the core of this research, 2)New methods of processing raw 3D scan data into a format  readily useful in applications such as gaming, cinema, engineering, security, etc. 3)Functionality and data distribution on CPUs and GPUs (looked upon as co-processors) for very large datasets using the graphics cluster in the lab. and 4)Development of interactive and immersive systems incorporating these techniques for multidisciplinary applications in web usage, bioinformatics, patient education and clinical data. The results would immensely benefit the graphics research community at large as well as Canadian industries of gaming, cinema, healthcare and engineering.

"The goal outlined in this proposal is two-fold: First, we would like to increase our ability to model materials with atomistic simulations, in particular with molecular dynamics. For this purpose, we would like to improve our capability to predict the electrostatics of molecular systems without having to revert to first principle methods. Second, we plan to investigate the response of specific, technologically relevant materials to extreme conditions.

     The molecular dynamics-based modeling of processes involving coordination changes or bond breaking and formation is strongly impeded by our inability to predict the electrostatics of molecular systems. We would like to further develop a recently suggested scheme that attempts to overcome this deficiency. The new approach combines two schemes that previously were mutually exclusive, specifically a bond-type and an atom-type description of electrostatics. Our method development will also support attempts to treat polarizability and dispersive interactions on an equal footing.

     Applications of MD are anticipated for two classes of materials, specifically metal phosphates, which are used as anti-wear additives in lubricants, as well as so-called phase change materials, i.e., alloys consisting of germanium, antimony, and tellurium, which are used in optical storage media. The combining element of both classes of materials is that their functionality appears to be intimately linked to coordination changes, e.g., zinc changes its coordination in zincphosphates under pressure (thereby forming networked anti-wear films) and germanium changes its coordination under laser radiation (thereby switching the alloy between being conducting and being insulating). To be better able to tailor these materials to our needs, we plan to obtain a more thorough understanding of their phase diagrams, in particular as a function of their detailed chemical composition. We hope to provide guidelines for the design of higher density optical storage media and new, environmentally friendly anti-wear additives.

"Recent advances in information and wireless technologies have led to growing interests in the development of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which promise enormous improvement in  road safety, and elimination of the excessive cost of traffic collisions.



As a key component of ITS, Inter-Vehicular Communications (IVC) has recently attracted great attention in both academic and industrial communities. The most important feature of IVC is its ability to extend the horizon of drivers, thus improve road safety and traffic flow by alerting drivers to possible traffic collisions or traffic jams. In addition to these navigation safety functionalities, other applications have recently emerged, such as audio/video streaming, high-speed internet access, and cooperative downloading.



The recently proposed cooperative diversity provides an ideal physical layer solution for inter-vehicular ad-hoc networks, an issue largely avoided in the literature. However, the main challenge is that the available research on cooperative diversity is not directly applicable to IVC. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to investigate cooperative diversity for inter-vehicular communications in order to satisfy the stringent performance requirements for vehicular safety applications. Specifically, we will develop a general framework for the design and development of cooperative communication paradigms for vehicular networks, which are compatible with IEEE 802.11p standard for Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE) also known as Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC).

"The long term objective of my research program is to understand the neurological basis for behavioural plasticity in vertebrates. The short term objective of my research program is to determine how manipulation of sensory and supraspinal inputs to the spinal cord alter locomotor limb function and the strength of intact spinal pathways in rats. Spinal plasticity, in the form of strengthening of brainstem-spinal connections, underlies the recovery of breathing movements after unilateral spinal transection (hemisection) in the neck (cervical) region. This strengthening is enhanced by removal of sensory input to the spinal cord (spinal sensory denervation, SSD). The effects of SSD on behaviour other than breathing have not been quantified, although this would provide valuable insight into the plastic capabilities of spinal circuitry. My laboratory is well suited to address this problem because we can quantitatively assess sensorimotor, including locomotor, abilities in rats. In particular, we measure ground reaction forces (GRF), a novel and sensitive method for assessing overground locomotion in rats. We propose to investigate whether SSD alters locomotor limb function after hemisection and whether this is accompanied by altered strength in locomotor brainstem-spinal connections.  Specifically, AIM 1 tests the hypothesis that SSD improves forelimb locomotor function after cervical hemisection. We will measure forelimb function using GRF and kinematic analysis during 2 different locomotor tasks in groups of hemisected rats with and without SSD. AIM 2 tests the hypothesis that the effect of SSD is generalizable to other regions of the spinal cord, by applying the above approach to the thoracic spinal cord and measuring hindlimb function. Finally, AIM 3 tests the hypothesis that SSD increases the strength of brainstem connections to limb motoneurons after spinal hemisection. This will be accomplished by recording the amplitude of electrical signals in fore- and hindlimb motor nerves evoked by stimulation of brainstem pathways in hemisected rats with and without SSD. These experiments will provide important information regarding the potential of neural circuitry throughout the spinal cord to facilitate changes in motor behaviour.

"Ordinary and partial differential equations arise in a wide variety of scientific and engineering settings. The objectives of this proposal focus on the development of new algorithms and software for the numerical

solution of such equations. There are two main avenues of investigation: 

(a) The numerical solution of systems of boundary value ordinary differential equations (BVODEs): Our investigations will focus on improvements to BVODE software, e.g., improvements in error control strategies (specifically in the control of the residual of the numerical solution), improvements in assessment of problem sensitivity (i.e. conditioning) and global error estimation, and extension of the problem class that can currently be treated, e.g. higher order derivative systems, more general (coupled) boundary conditions, and differential equations with delay and advance terms (in which the evaluation of the derivative depends on solution information at several points in the problem domain), 

(b) The numerical solution of systems of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) in one space dimension: Our investigations will focus on improvements to PDE software, e.g., more efficient estimation of the spatial global error, estimation and control of global temporal error, time integrators with improved efficiency or stability, simplification of the usage of the software through the use of a more powerful computer languages, and the generalization of our techniques to allow the treatment of PDEs with two spatial dimensions. The significance of this work will to be to increase the ease-of-use, efficiency, robustness and capability of software for the numerical solution of BVODEs and PDEs, thereby increasing the ability of applications experts to solve more complicated systems of differential equations associated with more sophisticated mathematical models.

"A primary feature of eukaryotic cells is the compartmentalization or ""division of labor"" of distinct metabolic pathways into separate subcellular organelles, a process that is ensured by the proper intracellular trafficking of protein constituents to each organelle. Research described in this grant application is aimed at gaining an understanding of the biogenesis (assembly and maintenance) of peroxisomes - organelles that are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells and are highly dynamic in regards to their shapes, motility and metabolic functions. They are also important sites for the development of some viral pathogens. Indeed, scientists now appreciate that peroxisomes participate in far more processes than previously proposed and that, as new discoveries continue to be made, other unexpected roles for peroxisomes will likely be uncovered. The emphasis of the planned research is on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the biogenesis of peroxisomes in plant cells, specifically the role the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as the membrane template for the formation and maintenance of (new) peroxisomes and the strategies that viruses employ in order to exploit peroxisomes for their replication within infected plant cells. Overall, state-of-the-art interdisciplinary approaches will be utilized in order to enhance our basic knowledge of plant biology, including the fundamental processes of peroxisome assembly and the mechanisms of virus replication. These studies will be important also in a broader context since the results can be applied to our understanding of (conserved) peroxisome functioning in other organisms, such as in humans where defects in peroxisome biogenesis underlie several inherited diseases. Ultimately, this research will not only aid in the future rational design of important Canadian agriculture crop plants to produce important nutritional and industrial bioproducts that rely on proper intracellular protein trafficking and peroxisome-related functions, but also provide training for the development of young scientists who will be well prepared for careers in Canadian academia, government or industry.

"To support more business initiatives than ever before, companies integrate diverse sets of applications into mission-critical enterprise systems. The scale and complexity of these systems creates unprecedented development, configuration, support, and management challenges. Even with the best intentions during system development, unforeseen problems may still occur in an integrated production system. To obtain a successful running system that achieves defined quality goals, such as availability and performance, the timely detection and resolution of failures is needed. Thus, effective diagnosis capabilities in application software, systematic and preventative practices in the support organization, and incremental migration toward self-healing systems are essential and strategic objectives.

The goal of this research is to investigate concepts, methods, techniques, technologies, and tools to assess, evaluate, and evolve the logging and diagnosis capabilities of enterprise management applications. Our project focuses on the logging and diagnosis capabilities and failure scenarios of selected CA Inc. applications. To extract the required information to assess these capabilities, we will develop methods and tools based on our extensive experience in software reverse engineering (e.g., is there sufficient information collected in logs to diagnose a specific potential problem). To evolve the diagnosis capabilities of existing applications, we will develop techniques based on our software migration expertise (e.g., incremental insertion of sensory and diagnosis capabilities). To improve failure detection and recovery, we will explore techniques based on our autonomic computing experience to inject self-management, self-healing, and automated diagnosis capabilities (e.g., sense the environment of the enterprise application and verify that the initialization and configuration parameters of the application are still valid).

"The heavier group 13 elements Al, Ga, and In play an important role in our modern life. Apart from aluminum's obvious presence as a bulk metal and as a component in alloys, organometallic alanes are indirectly present in the form of polymers (Ziegler/Natta type polymerization) and electronic devices (Chemical Vapor Deposition, CVD). The dearth of basic knowledge about organometallic aluminum compounds contrasts with the importance of the element. Gallium is the key component in modern electronic devices; e.g., GaAs is the second most important semiconductor known today. Indium is used in alloys and in semiconductor materials as an essential doping agent. Our main research activities are focused on the chemistry of the heavier group 13 elements aluminum, gallium, and indium. 

Our research program can be divided into the two main parts of Organometallic Synthesis (PART A) and Chemical Vapour Deposition (PART B). PART A is focused on the synthesis of novel organometallic polymers and the development of new catalysts for olefin polymerization. PART B is dedicated to studies of the fragmentation of chemical compounds used in the important process of chemical vapour deposition. We expect the results will allow for a rational design of precursors yielding improved materials.

"The red algae (Rhodophyta) are an ancient lineage with some members being reported in the fossil record as far back as 1.2 billion years.  This group is of considerable economic importance since they contain compounds (agar, carrageenan, etc.) that are used extensively as thickeners in products such as yogurt, ice cream and toothpaste.  Genera such as Porphyra (aka. Nori, laverbread) and Palmaria (aka. Dulse) are important food sources and are global billion dollar aquaculture industries.  In addition, the red algae are a critical group in the evolution of photosynthetic life on earth through secondary endosymbiosis of chloroplasts.  This simply means that several lineages currently capable of photosynthesis have gained that ability by engulfing and keeping other photosynthetic organisms inside them.  For example, red algae are the common ancestors to the chloroplasts contained in the division, Heterokontophyta (e.g. large kelps common to Atlantic and Pacific coasts).  This was a pivotal event in the evolution of photosynthetic life.  Despite the obvious importance of this group, very little is known about what are considered ""Bangiophyte"" species.  Even more fascinating is that even though the fossil, Bangiomorpha, exhibits the first example of sexual reproduction in the fossil record (1.2 BYA), many of these groups do not appear to undergo sexual reproduction or have lost the ability entirely.  This proposal focuses on examining these unique organisms and uses molecular techniques to discern if sexual reproduction is or is not occurring within populations.  In addition, determination of what a species is (still a challenging concept in many respects) in this unique group.  This research will provide a foundation for current genome sequencing projects.  In fact, despite considerable advancements in molecular and genomic biology, additional research on these interesting groups in terms of evolution, ecology and biology can only enhance the interpretation of future genomes.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","University of Waterloo",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","�volution et �cologie","�volution et �cologie"

"Magmatic ore deposits contribute billions of dollars to the global economy annually.  The majority of major magmatic ore deposits are related to the flux of mafic magmas from the mantle to the crust, bringing with them valuable metals, notably the base metals Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, Cr, Ti, V and the platinum group elements (PGE; Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, Ir, Os) and Au.   There are several types of magmatic ore deposit that are dominated by or associated with major accumulations of the mineral chromite.  To date, no significant production of Cr has ever occured in North America.  In this research we are examining an important new deposit of chromite recently discovered in Ontario and comparing it with similar deposits in Finland, India, Brazil and South Africa.  We will also do experiments in which we try to recreate the conditions of formation of chromite deposits in magmas at high temperatures and pressures.  The results are expected to improve the viability of the new deposit as an engine of economic growth in Canada while also improving our understanding of how deposits of this strategic metal are formed.","Earth sciences","University of Toronto",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","P�trologie, g�ologie ign�e et m�tamorphique","Sciences de la terre"

"The size and complexity of today's information systems dwarf those of five, let alone twenty, years ago. The demands of modern industrial applications for faster systems with greater memories are moving from ""large"" databases comprising a few billion bytes, or gigabytes, of information to specialized systems in the range of many terabytes (trillions of bytes). As demand escalates, the manner in which data is organized and the algorithms (or problem-solving methods) used to manipulate information become increasingly critical. More effective techniques, that address time and space constraints, must be created to allow large systems to better perform search operations in response to sophisticated queries and updates. In particular, this work will focus on succinct representations of data structures and their application to text indexing, as well as structures working efficiently in a complex memory heirarchy. In tandem with this application driven work is the fundamental notion of actually proving that the methods developed are indeed the best possible for the tasks at hand.

"Canada lacks critical information about boreal ecosystem carbon dynamics and carbon stability in boreal forest soils. This information is important to modelling efforts to predict responses of ecosystems to climate change and feedbacks that may impinge on the global carbon cycle. Our multidisciplinary team will measure key elements of carbon dynamics in boreal forests and subsequently integrate this information via a modelling exercise. Recent information from climate models suggests that the wide belt of black spruce forest that covers that Canadian Shield may be subject to more frequent wildfire disturbance in the future. Fires may also be less intense than they have been in the past. We will examine the relationship between fire severity and the quantity and quality of charcoal produced; the process of charring stabilizes carbon in a more recalcitrant form. We will also investigate the fate of charcoal in the soil profile, i.e. where and how it is stored, and how the material of origin (for example moss, or wood) might affect storage. We will measure input rates of carbon to the soil via burnt tree boles that gradually weather and fall to the soil to contribute to organic matter. Fire severity effects on early response of the understory (mosses, herbs and shrubs) will be evaluated and integrated into the modelling exercise. We will identify abiotic factors that may interact with severity to control plant succession, productivity (biomass) and therefore carbon storage. Finally, we will examine how black spruce seedlings regenerate under different fire severities. The emphasis will be on interaction of regeneration with other components of the ecosystem. For example, a lower production of charcoal with less severe fires may be beneficial to the ericad shrubs, since charcoal has been shown to absorb phenolic compounds that interfere with the nutrition and growth of conifers. We will work directly with our industrial partners to evaluate their current strategy of salvage of burnt wood, followed generally by site preparation and planting. We need to understand more about the impacts of both salvage (potential impacts on regeneration of both the seedlings and vegetation), as well as the success of replanting burnt sites after site preparation.

"The landscape of the province of Alberta features accumulations of wind deposited sands that occur in many places as fossil dune structures. Over the last two to three decades, a technique called luminescence dating has been developed by which sand grains from such landforms can be made to glow in a laboratory setting as a means of deciphering the amount of time that has elapsed since the sands were last buried. Investigations performed on dune structures from southern Alberta using such methods have demonstrated that the dune structures there have not remained fixed since their first emplacement. Instead, the sands have been remobilized at various times over the last 10 000 years. These episodes of reactivation have been linked to variations in climate. Contrastingly, only a limited number of studies have been carried out on dune sequences from central Alberta and results obtained suggest the dune structures in the region range in age between 15 700 and 10 500 years before present. No study to date, however, has constrained the duration over which deposition by wind occurred at any one location in central Alberta such that it remains unknown when precisely the activation by wind began, when it ended or whether it was recurrent. This study will collect samples from dune structures in central and northern Alberta containing depositional sequences longer than any investigated in the area to date. The collected samples will be dated using luminescence dating techniques to provide depositional chronologies. The results will be compared with data from southern Alberta as well those from across the Canadian prairies to elucidate on patterns in environmental change over the last 20 000 years. Such medium range data on climate change will help put the current global warming debate into context. In addition, sediments from lower sections of the dune structures should provide age constraints for the withdrawal of ice sheets from western Canada at the end of the last glacial period. Hence, such ages will be used to address the long standing question of whether an  inland 'ice-free corridor' did exist in western Canada around about 14 000 years ago or earlier that would have been used by the first Americans to migrate south to the mid latitudes.

"Thermal plasma technology is a high technology area which fits perfectly with Quebec's enviable position in abundant hydroelectric energy. Thermal plasmas are a highly effective way of producing nanoparticles (metallic, ceramic and intermetallic) and we have demonstrated their use in several systems (Ni, Cu, Al, SiO2, TiN). In the present proposal we will focus on the synthesis of ceramic nanoparticles in two competing systemc (transferred arc and induction coupled plasmas) to allow an assessment to be made of the most promising technology. Specifically we will study the synthesis of stable nanosized titania stabilized with silica. The challenge is to maintain the high photocatalytic activity of this material while applying it in relatively high temperature systems. As in our previous work, the major focus is on reactor design and scale up. Industrial production requires powers of hundreds of kW to MW while most experimental work has been at the sub 50 kW scale. We will build on past modelling and experimental work.

"My area of interest is information visualization, or infovis. I design, build, and evaluate systems that use interactive computer graphics to help people understand the structure of large, complex datasets in order to carry out particular tasks. My long-term research agenda is the development and validation of a more complete set of design guidelines for the field.



A balanced visualization research portfolio can have many aspects. In system design, I pursue a mix of user-driven and technique-driven projects. In evaluation, I am interested in both the low-level characterization of human visual response, and the higher-level comparison and characterization of specific visualization techniques.



In the future, the need for information visualization systems will become increasingly acute. One of the few quantities increasing faster than the CPU speeds predicted by Moore's Law is the amount of data that we generate to process. This explosion of data comes from many sources: processors with the ability to log events have become interwoven with the fabric of daily and business life; sensors have become small, cheap, and networked; and the growing feasibility of simulation allows the gathering of data about virtual rather than real-world events. Data collection is not an end of itself, but a means to the end of helping humans deal with the world. Computer-based visualization allows humans to wend their way through these mountains of data, making decisions based on understanding.

"In direct collaboration with atmospheric scientists, this program of research develops new theoretical and computational tools for mathematical fluid dynamics that improve our knowledge of the basic physical processes that govern atmospheric weather.  The proposed work focusses on two atmospheric flow features for which there exist important gaps in our theoretical understanding: (a) the propagation of large-scale waves over the Earth's spherical geometry; and (b) the interaction of the stratospheric winds with upward propagating gravity waves.



(a) The long standing textbook theory for the dynamics of mesoscale flow is quasigeostrophy (QG).  It is based upon a ""flat Earth"" approximation, and although it describes well the major features of atmospheric weather over the North American map, it does not address well, the interactions between the equatorial topics and midlatitudes.  This program of research has proposed a new global-QG theory for the propagation of waves around the Earth.  These ideas are being tested against observations of cross-equatorial propagation of Rossby waves in years characterized by the ""la Nina"" climatology. 



(b) Gravity wave propagation represents an important process for vertical transport of energy in the atmosphere.  One example is the wave-mean flow interaction, which occurs in the stratosphere as the quasi-biennial oscillation -- a reversal of the upper atmospheric winds every 26 months or so.  We are developing a new mathematical model that predicts a breakdown of these waves, that may explain the onset of the wave turbulence that is part of the reversal process.

"R is an open source implementation of the S programming language. As a member of the ""R Core Team"", I share authorship in it. My particular interests are in user interface issues and graphics. In particular, in one effort I am working on improving the connections between the internals of R and the source code created by the user: this will improve the usability of R and will enable studies of programmer performance. Another ongoing effort is the incorporation of 3D graphics into R, through the rgl package.



In previous work, colleagues at the University of Toronto and I have shown how to evaluate the significance of millions of genetic tests in a computationally efficient way.  Currently with one student I am investigating two related ideas: approximation of conditional significance, and approximation of multiple testing combinations.  Another student and I are looking into choosing the most economical but informative model.



A third focus of my work will be perfect simulation. Markov chain Monte Carlo is a general computational technique for sampling from an arbitrary distribution (e.g. a posterior distribution in Bayesian inference). Until late 1995, it was thought that in almost all cases this would yield samples with distributions only approximating the target distribution. Propp and Wilson (1996) showed that in some cases it is possible to get exact samples; my work and work with Green several years ago extended this to distributions on

continuous and unbounded state spaces. Moreover, Propp and Wilson's ideas can be extended to other contexts such as perfect simulation of stochastic diffusions that follow stochastic differential equations. Another student and I are developing perfect simulations of maxima, minima, and barrier crossing times for ""stochastic diffusions"", models which are commonly used in financial modelling.

"Spatio-temporal symmetry, ubiquitous in physical systems, can be used to derive highly simplified models which, however, can model the complex system dynamics of interest to researchers. The equivariant bifurcation theory has enabled a systematic study of the range of dynamics, transitions and constraints induced by the presence of symmetry. A dynamical analysis of the amplitude equations has yielded important and new results. The sequence of bifurcations of the forced Karman wake have been related to the dynamics of a large class of physical systemes having SO(2) Symmetry. The novelty of the proposed work is the exploitation of the natural geometry (spatio-temporal symmetry) common many complex systems such as sheared flows, chemical reactions, etc. to derive simplified flow control strategies or laws.



It has now been demonstrated both theoretically and in preliminary experiments that the known mode interaction between the underlying flow modes can yield efficient controllers - based on an in-depth knowledge of the nonlinear system. The next goal of the research program is further development of wake control laws based on derived amplitude equations and known dynamics. At the same time, detailed experimental work can now be performed. Plasma actuators are currently under development. They provide a new way to effect flow control.

"This proposal involves the study of representations of reductive p-adic groups. These groups are matrix groups whose matrix entries belong to certain fields that are important in number theory. There are three different components to the proposed research. The first component involves finding ways to classify some of the representations of p-adic groups. The current classification of some families of representations appears to be more complicated than it needs to be, and we plan to investigate ways of simplifying the classification. The second component involves studying properties of the characters of representations of reductive p-adic groups. The characters are functions that play an important role in harmonic analysis on p-adic groups. Our goal is to derive new formulas for the characters of particular kinds of representations. The third component involves the study of spherical characters of distinguished representations. Such representations have nice symmetry properties relative to involutions of the group. We hope to find formulas for spherical characters of some families of distinguished representations.","Not available","University of Toronto",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Th�orie de lie","Math�matiques pures"

"There is growing evidence that periods of either increased or decreased sensory activity has the capacity to affect the way that the brain subsequently processes sensory information, both from the area of altered activity and adjacent areas.   Altered input from the neck and back also has the potential to alter processing of sensory information from the upper limb.  It is hypothesized that changing sensory feedback from the neck alters the environment in the nervous system into which subsequent sensory feedback from the limbs is received and processed, thus leading to altered sensorimotor integration by the brain of that input.



This research involves the application of two techniques which can be used to measure sensorimotor integration in human subjects, namely somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) which measure the processing of sensory information by the brain and the application of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the human motor cortex, which measures the balance of motor output to a defined target muscle.  Applying these two techniques to similar patterns of repetitive movements will help us understand how changing sensory processing from the neck and upper limb affects the way the brain controls the output to hand and arm muscles.



This is important research because it will deepen our understanding of how sensory input from the spinal column interacts with feedback from the limbs to affect central sensorimotor integration. This research is important for Canadians.  It will help us understand how posture and habitual patterns of use affect the learning and acquisition of new motor skills.  It is relevant to the fields of motor learning, ergonomics and understanding the role of neural plasticity in the development of overuse injuries.

"Over the last 20 years, evidence has been amassing that Pangea, a supercontinent that formed 300 million years ago, is just the latest in a series of supercontinents that have formed repeatedly since the early Precambrian, only to break up and reform again.  Although the mechanisms responsible are controversial, many geoscientists agree that repeated cycles of supercontinent amalgamation and dispersal have had a profound effect on the evolution of the Earth's crust, atmosphere, climate, and life. The existence of Pangea, which broke up about 200 million years ago, is a cornerstone of plate tectonics, and its assembly and fragmentation have governed the evolution of the Earth's crust for the past 500 million years. To a first order, we know where and when Pangea formed, but not why. Over the next grant cycle, I intend to investigate why Pangea formed.  My approach is to combine field work with laboratory analyses of samples selected from sites that expose critical relationships between rock units. Graduate students are directly involved in each stage of the research program. I will continue to work on the evolution of the Rheic Ocean, an ocean that formed about 500 million years ago between dispersing continents (an interior ocean), and whose closure  200 million years later resulted in the amalgamation of Pangea.  However, to obtain a global view, I also need to study rocks that document the evolution of the Paleopacific ocean, an ""exterior"" ocean that surrounded the dispersing continents. If the evolution of these oceans is dynamically linked, then contraction of the interior ocean, which began about 440 million years ago should be coeval with expansion of the exterior ocean. The dual approach of field work augmented by laboratory analysis will allow me to test the potential geodynamic connection between interior and exterior oceans and to test various hypotheses (including some of my own) that have been proposed for the amalgamation of Pangea.

"Continuation of an active and successful research program to determine characteristics and regulation of a reproductive phenomenon known as obligate embryonic diapause (aka delayed implantation) is proposed.  Diapause occurs when mammalian embryos undergo developmental arrest at the blastocyst stage, to be later reactivated and implanted for continuation of pregnancy.  It is an evolutionary strategy that uncouples mating from gestation, allowing parturition at the optimal season for survival.  Diapause is in the gestational program of several carnivore families including the weasels, bears and seals.  It persists from a few weeks in spring breeding carnivores to several months in species that mate in the fall.  The proposal is based on the hypothesis that embryonic diapause is regulated by factors secreted by the uterus, while embryo implantation is initiated and orchestrated by the activated embryo. The overall objective is to determine the cellular mechanisms of the developmental arrest in embryonic diapause and to explore the embryo-uterine dialog that reactivates the embryo and induces implantation into the uterus.  The model employed is the ranch mink.  The first specific objective is to exploit results of our recent gene discovery investigation to determine mechanisms by which the uterus and embryo regulate entry and exit of the embryo from diapause.  Embryos will be collected at the morula stage and entry into diapause chronicled in vitro, as will exit from diapause in embryos collected in vivo, by probing for expression of cell signaling and cell cycle regulatory genes.  The pattern of expression of factors secreted by the uterus and their capacity to reactivate embryos in vitro will be tested.  The second specific objective is to investigate trophoblast as a regulator of local processes of implantation, and endometrial invasion.  It will be addressed by examination of formation and regulation of the invasive component, the syncytial trophoblast and by investigation of morphological and gene expression events of uterine remodeling.  New insight into diapause and implantation and information significant to understanding placental formation and embryo loss in other mammals will be gained from these novel experiments and approaches.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Universit� de Montr�al",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Reproduction animale","Biologie animale"
"The overall objective of the program is to create a new, novel, superior and sustainable research training and mentoring environment to form the next generation of reproductive and developmental biologists.  This will be achieved by providing multi-institutional, transdisciplinary training from fundamental molecular biology through applied and clinical research and research ethics.  Training in reproductive toxicology is also foreseen to develop scientists that can address the problems caused by endocrine and reproductive disrupters and other xenobiotics of environmental and pharmaceutical origin.  A further goal is to emphasize knowledge translation to develop industrial and government scientists that will be required to address Canada's needs for the 21st century.



The program will be implemented by integration of the infrastructure resources of a new, Qu�bec-wide program in reproductive biology known as the R�seau Qu�b�cois en Reproduction (RQR).  It will exploit the technical core facilities established and supported by the RQR and the range of expertise for co-mentorship within the network to develop unique and novel training environments and mechanisms.  The program is designed to leverage funding from several sources to maximize the training impact.  To address the needs of future investigation, there will be integration of bioinformatics training with genomic, cellular and molecular biology.  There will be a further focus on ethical conduct in science and the ethics of experimentation in reproductive biology.  The program promotes knowledge translation and the formation of highly qualified personnel for Canada's end users of reproductive and developmental biology research, the private and government sectors.  An important focus will be on providing the training to allow students and postdoctoral fellows to make the transition to technical, academic and industrial scientific posts upon completion of their programs.

"Dr. Murphy's research program focuses on the measurement of nitrogen-containing species that play a role in problems like smog, acid rain, climate change and nutrient pollution. Dr. Murphy's approach is to take state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation out into the real world to make measurements of these reactive nitrogen compounds to understand their chemical and physical behaviour in the environment. The tools used by Dr. Murphy's research program include several instruments that together permit a measure of all of the species in the reactive nitrogen family including trace gases, such as nitrogen dioxide, ammonia, and nitric acid, and aerosol species, such as ammonium nitrate. The research will help to reduce the large uncertainties that exist regarding the magnitude and patterns of reactive nitrogen emissions into the atmosphere and their subsequent processing, dispersal and deposition. 



The instruments are sensitive and reliable enough to make measurements in a wide variety of locations with a minimum of upkeep. Measurements in the near field of pollution sources will be used to improve emission estimates of anthropogenic sources of reactive nitrogen. By deploying the instrumentation to remote areas, we can study the nitrogen cycle in regions with less immediate human impact. Direct measurements of the air-surface exchange of reactive nitrogen species will provide a more accurate, mechanistic understanding of deposition processes that are currently highly parameterized in regional and global models, and simultaneously quantify the emissions of reactive nitrogen from ""natural"" systems. While much of the past focus on the chemistry of nitrogen oxides has been on their role as precursors to photochemical ozone production, this program will include a study of their role in nighttime loss of ozone. Observations made by this research group will improve our fundamental understanding of the key processes controlling the cycles of nitrogen compounds, which is needed to develop policies related to clean air on local, regional and global scales.

"The immature brain is not simply a small adult brain and normal development depends upon a complex series of interactions between nature and nurture. The original studies of Hubel and Wiesel showed that visual experience during early critical periods of postnatal development profoundly affects the development and functioning of the visual areas of the brain. The overall aim of this proposal is to build upon the insights from our earlier studies of critical periods for visual development and extend them to address an important and emerging field of study -- interactions between the development of visual cortex and other cortical areas.



The goal of the proposed experiments is to characterize the influence of abnormal early visual experience on the developmental trajectory of neural plasticity mechanisms in a number of cortical areas, including extra-striate and frontal cortex.  These studies endeavor to bridge levels of analysis and to test the links between behavioural, physiological, and cellular changes that are  driven by abnormal early visual experience.

"Although evolution is fact, the discovery and documentation of its mechanisms of change through time form critical areas of biological investigation. Academically, my program's primary objective is to understand patterns and processes of species diversification, in particular focusing on keystone species in biodiversity hotspots. The work will centre on the biogeographically important Caucasus Mountains, a Biodiversity Hotspot, and on montane vipers. It is also critical to understand the genetic interactions of reunited lineages and their contribution to the genetic differentiation of populations. Consequently, we will continue to study reunited lineages of reptiles in Baja California. Patterns of genetic diversification are extremely interesting and central to our understanding of the process of divergence-the bridge between macro- (species-level) and microevolution (population-level). By incorporating genealogical tree-building analyses, comparative biogeography and statistical population genetics, my research program will explore these issues.



The research program also concentrates on training. Graduate and undergraduate students, and visiting scholars from abroad, gain expertise in molecular data gathering, as well as analysis and application. For example, much of the labs efforts centre on conservation, in particular the application of genetic data to saving species. The data are gathered and presented in a way that conforms to existing laws.

"Supramolecular organic photochemistry examines the interaction of light with supramolecular assemblies composed of organic molecules. Supramolecular assemblies that undergo light-induced processes are continually being developed to custom-tailor functions in areas such as drug delivery, catalysis, and optoelectronic molecular devices. The functionality achieved by supramolecular assemblies is a consequence of complementary intermolecular interactions that direct their formation and the photochemical properties of the molecular components. We are developing innovative, functional liposomes through the integration of photochromic compounds with elements of lipid complementarity and reversible photocontrols. These photochromic liposomes will undergo reversible changes in membrane permeability that will restore membrane integrity following the release of encapsulated compounds. We will achieve this objective by incorporating photochromes that span the entire lipid bilayer. Thus far, photochromic systems have lacked this aspect of organization, and the extent of their photoinduced release has been small, except when liposome stability is irreversibly compromised. By spanning the bilayer, isomerization will produce permeable channels through which entrapped molecules will diffuse, resulting from changes in photochrome structure. Charged tethers will anchor the disruptive, photochromic units in place until isomerization back to their more complementary form restores the local lipid order. This approach will be developed through the integration of lipid analogues with two photochromic moieties. These dimers will not only produce larger increases in membrane permeability than previous systems, but also restore membrane integrity. In addition, we will develop similar photochromes with improved two-photon absorption to enhance the spatial and temporal selectivity of these liposomes in practical applications such as photoregulated drug delivery where the delivered dosage will be precisely and reversibly controlled with light. This strategy will benefit public health through a reduction in hospitalization time, lead to patentable technologies, and generate an overall savings to Canada's health care system.

"Our long term research goals are to determine how cells of tissues communicate their needs to blood vessels in order to maintain adequate blood flow and ensure proper tissue function.  Tissues, skeletal muscle for example, can communicate metabolic needs directly to the vasculature in order to maintain appropriate blood flow over a range of skeletal muscle activities i.e rest and exercise. How this blood flow control is achieved is not well understood.  We plan to combine the use of skeletal muscle and microscopy such that the blood vessels can be visualized directly under different levels of skeletal muscle activity.  With this model we will be able to identify how skeletal muscle cells signal the cells of the blood vessels to communicate their needs and how cells of the blood vessels intercommunicate with each other to eventually change blood flow to the working muscles.  

     There is a critical nature to maintaining proper blood flow to tissue function and health.  Blood flow is a regulator of the cell and tissue environment with both supply nutrients and removal waste products.  Mismatching blood flow to tissue demand will result in cellular and tissue failure and damage.  This research program is generating knowledge relevant to understanding how adequate blood flow is supplied to tissues to maintain a healthy working environment. Achieving our research goals will lead to an understanding of blood flow regulation that will be instrumental in identifying ways to increase blood flow when necessary (i.e. to the placenta to enhance fetal health or to the peripheral tissue in a diabetic patient) or decrease blood flow if necessary (i.e. in tumor vasculature). In addition, through these studies, this research program will contribute to both the education and training of the next generation of integrated physiologists by providing a rigorous and high quality training ground.

"    )	I study the evolution of fishes, particularly those that are well represented in the fossil record. Of particular interest are fishes that were swimming in the waters of the tropics and North America during the time of the dinosaurs. Many of these fish continued to flourish after the dinosaurs became extinct. During the interval of time that is of particular interest, not only was there the major extinction event that effected the dinosaurs, but the continents of the world were also undergoing considerable rearrangement to eventually come to be placed in the manner that is familiar to us today. Prior to the extinction event, there was a large seaway stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean, completely separating the eastern and western parts of North America. Some continents were closer together, with South America and Africa united in a single land mass. The changes in the continental configurations, such as the widening southern Atlantic Ocean eventually splitting Africa from South America, and the east and west parts of North American being united as the seaway retreated, drastically altered the distribution of both marine and freshwater fishes. By studying the fish fossils from this time period, we can determine ancient distribution patterns of particular fishes, and link these to changing global environments.

    )	A particular group under study is the snakehead fishes which are well known from their living members which are important food fishes, aquarium species, and voracious predators that have become invasive species in North America. Study of the fossil members of this group is expected to determine their history, when they arose and where they originated, perhaps leading to clues as to why these fish are such successful invaders.

"Vibrations of small metal spheres embedded in a glass block can be observed using reflected laser light. The wavelength of a steady laser beam is shifted up or down according to the frequency of the vibration in Raman scattering. The vibrations can be more directly observed using brief pulses of laser light shorter than one billionth of a second. Theoretical work is needed to calculate the frequencies of these vibrations, taking into consideration the elastic response of the metal as well as the shape and surroundings of the metal sphere. Molecular dynamics simulations, in which the positions and velocities of many (up to 100000) point masses are calculated with time on a computer, are used.  The Fourier transform of the motion is used to find the frequencies of individual modes. Materials with direction dependent (anisotropic) speed of sound can be simulated in this way. Nanoclusters with non-spherical shape can also be handled. Finally, the effect of a surrounding material, such as a glass block, can be studied.  The results of these investigations will give new insight into the mechanical properties of very small objects.  This knowledge has potential future application when very small mechanical devices are designed.

"Concern exists over recent change in the distribution and abundance of animals, and understanding the determinants of species range limits is an important reserarch priority.  This program will address mechanisms underlying range limits in lynx and eastern wolves; the southern range limit of lynx apparently is determined by habitat fragmentation, whereas the southern wolf distribution limit is defined by a hybrid zone with eastern coyotes.  Lynx will be radio-collared using GPS transmitters along a habitat fragmentation gradient, and behavioural responses to fragmentation will be documented.  Specifically, we will assess behavioural plasticity relevant to landscape fragmentation and habitat structure.  Additional work will focus on understanding lynx-snowshoe hare dynamics in marginal habitat at the distributional edge.  Eastern wolves and non-wolf hybrids will be monitored for space use and movement patterns.  Survival monitoring of adults and pups, along with litter size assessment from den-site visits, will determine if hybrids have higher fitness than non-hybrids.  Mate selection patterns will be assessed using genetic analysis.  The ability of wolves to naturally exclude non-wolves from suitable habitat will be evaluated via simulated dispersal experiments.  Both the lynx and eastern wolf projects will culminate with development of population models, parameterized with field data, that predict future distribution and range limits of each species.

"My research intersects three areas: algebraic geometry, analytic number theory and information security.  These areas are not disjoint but are interrelated.  Here is a brief description of what I propose to work on



(1) Algebraic cycles on Abelian varieties: The conjectures of Tate and Hodge relating algebraic cycles on smooth projective algebraic varieties to certain spaces of cohomology classes are still open. However, in the case of Abelian varieties over finite fields, some very interesting and approachable problems present themselves. It is possible that the solution of these problems may throw light on the conjectures themselves. 



(2) Families of L-functions: In recent work, I have obtained some results about distribution of values of the logarithm and the logarithmic derivatives of Dirichlet L-functions at s=1. These have some interesting arithmetic applications, for example to a famous conjecture of Kummer. The methods will be able to address some other questions as well. I am also interested in the theme of families of L-functions on which additional structure can be established. I recently introduced a class of L-functions that has a natural ring structure. It will be interesting to study the spectrum of this ring. 



(3) Data Integrity: In the last two years, I have worked with N. Volkovs to develop a new algorithm to check integrity of data. Until a few years ago, the most widely used algorithm for this purpose was the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1 and its variants). As the collision resistance of this family of algorithms has been called into question, there is a world-wide search for a replacement. We have been investigating our algorithm for speed and collision resistance.

"As a newly recruited assistant professor at the University of Ottawa, I am establishing a research program directed towards the development of novel synthetic methods for the isolation of inorganic nano-magnetic materials and the study of their interesting magnetic properties. This is an important and innovative research area awaiting exploration which holds the key to faster and lower-power electronics and higher density data storage. Research will primarily focus on the isolation and study of two types of nano-materials, Single-Molecule Magnets (SMMs) and Single-Chain Magnets (SCMs). Such molecules exhibit superparamagnet-like slow magnetization relaxation and straddle the classical/quantum interface in displaying quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM). In order to synthesize new SMMs, a novel lanthanide/actinide and transition metal mixed-metal strategy in the presence of oxygen based and nitrogen based bridging ligands will be investigated. A controlled mixed-metal actinide/lanthanide and transition metal building block approach will be utilized for the preparation of SCMs in which magnetic units of varying size will firstly be designed and isolated. These units will subsequently be linked using linear linkers such as acetate, azide, dicyanamide, oxalate and cyanide into 1-D infinite SCMs. Research will also be directed towards the modification of molecular magnetic systems into soft-matter phases and the amalgamation of nano-magnetic particles with fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. This research will utilize the SMMs and SCMs synthesized in the scope of this research program. The proposed program represents a unique approach to the development and understanding of nano-magnetic materials and could lead to the commercial application of such molecules. Extensive running costs will be required in the commencement and development of this innovative research program in order to produce cutting edge results and to train highly qualified personnel. Therefore, NSERC funding is imperative to the success of this research program.","Materials sciences","University of Ottawa",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Chimie inorganique","Chimie inorganique"

"Implantation of multi-electrode arrays into the brain is becoming increasingly more prevalent within the neuroscience research community. Many of these studies have been influenced by the recent surge in neural prosthetic research.  These arrays are predominantly implanted on the surface of the brain.  However, motor and cognitive variables extracted from signals deep in the brain have also been shown to be effective for neural prosthetics.  Thus, development of multi-electrode arrays that can be implanted at arbitrary depths is vital to this research.  These arrays must be small enough to minimize cortical damage, strong enough to withstand forces encountered due to deep brain insertion, and must remain active for years.  Here we develop a research program to design and fabricate novel silicon arrays that meet these criteria.   To do this, we will reinforce the silicon probes in order to increase their tensile strength without increasing their diameter.  We will also introduce nanoporous holes into the probes and fill them with specific proteins that can encourage neural growth around the probes.  This multidisciplinary research will provide funding for 2 PhD students and 2 MSc students.  Moreover, these arrays will afford the neuroscience community a new way to measure deep brain function that may lead to a wider range of clinical applications.","Medical and health sciences","McGill University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Sciences de la vie li�es � la sant� publique et aux maladies humaines","Sciences de la vie li�es � la sant� publique et aux maladies humaines"

"Society's demand for electricity continues to grow, yet environmental, regulatory and economic constraints often preclude the construction of new power plants and transmission lines. The challenge now faced by engineers, equipment manufacturers, and regulatory agencies is to find ways to maximize the capacity of existing power lines, derived from the maximum allowable flow of power. The most important factor limiting this flow is thermal, as overloading of thermally limited circuits can result in physical failures. It is typically based on conservative weather assumptions to ensure that safety and reliability requirements are met. As a result, transmission lines are generally underutilized. At the same time, the risk of circuit failure is not completely eliminated, because the assumptions, while conservative, do not represent a true worst-case scenario. This project will develop a system for dynamic rating of transmission lines based on mesoscale Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, that have recently become commonly available and that can be run with relatively modest computing resources. These models can provide much more detailed information than any observation or measurement network. Rating systems using outputs of such models will provide relevant meteorological parameters with a spatial resolution comparable to the spans of overhead lines themselves. Besides better utilization of existing transmission lines, the proposed system will provide a number of other

benefits, such as: 1) Construction of new transmission circuits can be deferred or avoided based on the knowledge of true line ampacities; 2) Continuous monitoring and comparison of ratings and actual loads can be used for asset management and maintenance purposes; 3) Energy losses can be minimized by avoiding operation of lines close to their actual thermal limit; 4) Unused line capacity can be harnessed for new developments of alternative (e.g. wind power) generation assets ; 5) Electricity trading opportunities can be seized and unnecessary load shedding avoided.","Electrical energy","University of Alberta",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","R�seaux �lectriques","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"

"Several sedimentary basins formed within what is now the western Canada Cordillera between about 190 and 40 million years ago. This was a critical time in the evolution of this area with large sections of the earth's crust (terranes) added to the western margin of North America and resultant deformation of this margin causing major mountain belts and several types of large-scale faulting.   The sediments deposited in these basins preserve a record of the types of deformation and history of changes along the margins of the basins.  This record can be examined by looking at the specific types of minerals which make up the sandstone, the rock types of clasts in conglomerates, and the chemistry of the mudstone.   By carefully reconstructing this depositional history and the changes in source areas in these basins it is possible to infer the timing and patterns of the major deformation events during the basin formation and in some instances to infer their position along the North American margins at the time when the basins were receiving sediment (the position of the various basins and underlying terranes is currently hotly debated). Many of these basins are also known or potential sources for signifcant economic resourcs, including oil, gas, coal and coalbed methane. Detailed geologic studies of these basins are important in both decerning the potential to find these resources and in narrowing the search to the most prospective areas. A key element in conducting these types of studies is to very carefully document the internal structure (faults and folds for example) and sedimentatry features of the basin.  This includes mapping the different geologic units within the basin at a much more detailed scale than presently available, and demonstrating the types, thicknesses and variations of sedimentary rocks and their specific characteristics to understand the type of depositional environment that controlled their formation and in turn the type of basin that was present.  It is also crucial to measure and systematically document the directions of any original current indicators (water or air) that provide the direct evidence for the location of the source areas for the sediments which are now sedimentary rocks in these basins.

"Johne's disease (JD) is an incurable chronic and wasting disease affecting ruminant animals such as cows, goats, sheep elk and deer. Animals become infected by eating live Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (or MAP) bacteria in food, water or milk.  JD affects herds in all regions of Canada with up to 40% of dairy herds reporting an infected animal. Herds with infected animals suffer very significant economic looses from decrease in milk production, fertility and increased culling of sick animals. There is also concern regarding the possible association between MAP and some cases of Crohn's disease in humans. These concerns will continue until there is definitive proof against such a link but it would be devastating to the cattle industry if such link were established. Currently there are no vaccines that protect animals against infection and no treatments that prevent or reduce MAP shedding in feces and milk. However, JD can be controlled by stopping the cow-to-cow spread of MAP and this goal can achieved by identifying and removing infected animals before they start shedding the bacterium. However, the current diagnostic tests lack the sensitivity and specificity to detect animals with early stage (or subclinical) disease. To develop such tests, research effort is needed to build on our understanding of the biology and genetics of MAP bacteria and to discover MAP components that can be used to design MAP-specific diagnostic assays and possibly vaccines. To date only a few MAP proteins have been identified and fully characterized. The purpose of our study is to use current recombinant technologies to characterize the proteins secreted by MAP. Secreted proteins make first contact with the host, determine the course of infection and contain the antigens recognized by the host immune system to induce antibody and cell mediated responses. Characterizing secreted proteins also has practical application in the discovery of novel reagents for profiling host immune responses, diagnosis of infection, and differentiation between vaccinated and infected hosts.

"In beef and dairy cattle, collectively referred to as ruminants, protein that is provided in the diet is required for the production of edible products like meat and milk. However, the efficiency of converting dietary protein into milk or meat protein is poor at only 15 to 30%.  In part, this inefficiency of dietary protein utilization arises because microorganisms in the ruminant's digestive tract degrade dietary protein to yield ammonia which they then use to synthesize their own proteins. This results in significant amounts of dietary protein being absorbed into the bloodstream in the form of ammonia, rather than as amino acids which are the building blocks of milk and meat protein. Ammonia that is aborbed into the bloodstream is detoxified via its conversion to urea by the liver, and most of the urea produced is excreted in the urine, thus resulting in an irreversible loss of nitrogen to the animal and also causing environmental degradation. However, ruminants can recycle some of this urea to the digestive tract, where it can be used by microorganisms as a source of nitrogen to synthesize their own microbial protein which, in turn, can be be used by the host animal as a source of amino acids. This recycling mechanism allows ruminants to have several opportunities to capture nitrogen that would otherwise be wasted.

Our understanding of how urea recycling to the digestive tract is regulated in ruminants is still very limited. Recent work demonstrated the presence of some protein molecules (called urea transporters, UT) in the digestive tract that might play a critical role in urea transport across the digestive tract; however, how the function of these UT is regulated by changes in diet composition or end-products of feed digestion remains obscure. Therefore, the broad objectives of the proposed research is to determine the quantitative significance of these UT in urea recycling to the digestive tract, and how such factors as basal diet composition affect the activity of UT. This research will result in the development of strategies to increase urea recycling to the digestive tract of ruminants, thereby improving the utilization of diet protein.

"Immune responses in the intestine must be tightly regulated to prevent unwanted inflammation against harmless antigens and commensal bacteria and yet allow for the induction of protective immunity to pathogens. A dysregulation of this balance results in abnormal immune responses leading to intestinal inflammation and allergy. The overall goal of my research is to improve our understanding of the regulation of immune responses in the intestine. The focus of the proposed research is to explore regulation of Toll-like receptors (TLR)-induced innate immune responses in Peyer's patches. TLRs are a class of receptors used by the immune system to detect microbial agents. TLRs are now known to be critical role in the initiation, development and regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses.  We found that CpG DNA, an agonist for TLR9, strongly activates immune cells from blood, lymph nodes and spleen. However, CpG very poorly activated immune cells from Peyer's patches (PP) in the intestine, even though they express high levels of TLR9, suggesting that the poor responses are not due to lack of receptors. We found that resting PP cells spontaneously secreted high levels of an immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10, which suppressed innate immune responses in this tissue. We will now continue this investigation to fully establish how PP are involved in regulating intestinal innate immune responses. Understanding how TLR-induced immune responses are regulated in the intestine may contribute significantly in the rational development of oral vaccines and may direct therapeutic approaches to intestinal inflammatory conditions in animals.

"Hypothesis: The mouse submaxillary gland protein, mSMGP, plays a role in non-innate, and possibly immune host defense against invading organisms and infection. Proposal: To examine the function of mSMGP using a mouse knockout model and to further delineate mSMGP antimicrobial properties.

The mouse submaxillary (submandibular) gland exhibits both endocrine and exocrine functions, and is the site of synthesis of several biologically active polypeptides, including hormones, growth factors, and digestive enzymes. Although many of these proteins are well studied and characterized, the function of yet many others remain elusive. We have identified a gene, whose protein we termed the mouse submaxillary gland protein (mSMGP), that is highly expressed in this gland and whose function is yet to be elucidated. As well, mSMGP is also found in saliva and other bodily fluids such as tears, sweat and secretions from the seminal vesicle. We have subsequently shown that mSMGP binds some strains of both human and mouse oral bacteria.  These observations, as well as some clues that have come from a human homologue which can bind to the CD4 molecule and inhibit T lymphocyte apoptosis, led us to hypothesize that one of the functions of mSMGP is in host defense; both immune and non-immune. To address mSMGP function in vivo, we have generated a mouse mSMGP knockout model. Using histopathological analysis of the knockout mouse, structural and proteomics analyses and a series of bacterial studies, our current objectives are to fully define the phenotype attributed to loss of mSMGP function, and to examine its interaction with bacteria both in vivo and in vitro. Protection against invading organisms or infection via oral contamination is to date, poorly understood and thus the proposed studies are among the very few that approach the infection phenomenon from an oral perspective. This study will yield critical insights into the function and biology of the mSMGP, and consequently contribute further knowledge about submandibular biology.

"In both nature and the man-made world, turbulent flows are the norm (whereas laminar flows are the exception).  The research to be undertaken involves the study of mixing within turbulent flows - a phenomenon that underlies a wide range of processes, including aerodynamics, meteorology, combustion, and environmental pollutant dispersion.



To this end, the present application proposes six complementary research projects:



1)    )	Studies of velocity-passive scalar cospectra in inhomogeneous turbulent flows

2)    )	Lagrangian analysis of turbulent flows

3)    )	Studies of the scalar dissipation rate

4)    )	Effect of scalar-field initial conditions on the universality of turbulent passive scalars

5)    )	Effect of background turbulence on the evolution of a turbulent jet

6)    )	Source locating in turbulent flows



The results of the above studies will advance our understanding of turbulent flows by answering important questions that were previously unresolved.  The obtained knowledge can then be applied to technological improvements in disciplines related to energy and the environment (e.g., by increased combustor efficiencies or through improved pollutant dispersion modeling).

"The causes and consequences of population dynamics are the domain of population ecologists.  Population dynamics of endemic and exotic species often differ in that outbreaks of endemic populations are temporary while those of exotic species are persistent. the most striking dynamics of endemic forest Lepidoptera in the northern hemisphere are population cycles. Characteristics associated with these population cycles are; a periodicity of 6 to 11 years between outbreaks, population increase over 5 to 8 years and then a rapid decline, no period of persistent low population density, and synchronicity among separate populations. For western tent caterpillars epizootics of a viral disease occur in population outbreaks. We propose to study two questions about tent caterpillar population dynamics: Is severity of viral infection in outbreak populations related to environmental conditions, and is the synchronicity of populations among sites environmentally determined or due to dispersal?  We will use newly developed genetic markers to determine to what extent dispersal of moths among populations maintains synchronicity and field experiments and weather and population records to study viral epizootics.     )	

    )	In the absence of natural enemies, introduced organisms frequently maintain outbreak densities.  To combat these outbreaks, exotic control agents are introduced. The challenge to population ecologists is to identify the characteristics of biocontrol agents and target weeds that allow control at a lower equilibrium.  The recent dramatic decline of diffuse knapweed, the most serious rangeland weed in British Columbia, following the establishment of a new biological control agent, prompts us to ask ""How many insects are necessary for successful biological control?"" Parsimony in choosing the types and numbers of biocontrol agents is required for the future safety of this valuable tool for dealing with invasive, exotic pests.  We will use field experiments and observations to determine if a single agent can successfully control knapweed and compare the characteristics of successful to unsuccessful agents.

"This proposal is motivated by open questions related to the variability of the ocean circulation and water mass properties during the past decades, and its effects on climate through the transport of heat and freshwater. Of primary concern is the circulation and the day-to-decade variability in the North Atlantic Ocean, as driven by the atmospheric forcing, by interactions between processes of different scales, by exchanges between basins and regional circulation features of the North Atlantic (including the Nordic Seas), and by the influence of the world ocean circulation (especially the Arctic). It is based upon the integration of the output from a hierarchy of numerical models at a number of resolutions with oceanic observations and historical analysis of oceanic data. The historical observational record is used to validate numerical models, as well as to improve them throughout assimilation. Meanwhile, the model output can be used to fill in some of the gaps in the observations and to strengthen the possible conclusions that can be made, as well as highlighting additional questions that need to be examined in the observational record.","Oceans, seas and estuaries","University of Alberta",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Oc�anographie physique","Oc�anographie"
"Our understanding of the physical universe rests on two corner-stones: quantum mechanics and general relativity. Quantum mechanics describes subatomic particles using statistical notions to predict their behavior.  In contrast, general relativity, Einstein's theory of gravity, provides a precise description of physics on astronomical scales using spacetime geometry. Unifying these two theories and their remarkably dissimilar views of nature in a single framework remains the outstanding fundamental question for theoretical physicists in the twenty-first century. String theory stands as the leading candidate in this quest. The distinguishing feature of string theory is that rather than regarding elementary particles as point-like, they are extended in one direction, i.e., ""strings."" A noteworthy property of this approach is that gravity emerges as a necessary ingredient of these theories. Yet the burden of a unified quantum theory of gravity is to consistently describe physics on all scales, from subatomic out to astronomical scales. At present, our knowledge is inadequate to answer whether string theory truly fulfills this goal and so a great deal of work remains to understand this remarkably rich and complex structure and its physical implications. Much of my research involves studying how these new ideas may be tested experimentally. For example, the stringy character of matter may be revealed at particle accelerator experiments or in cosmological observations. One incisive example would be provided by ""cosmic superstrings"": Microscopic strings created in the early universe and stretched to macroscopic sizes by cosmological expansion. Such strings could be seen with astronomical observations.



Seventy years ago, it would have been impossible to predict that understanding of quantum mechanics would lead to modern computers. So too, it is impossible now to predict how the current research in string theory will ultimately impact on our lives or those of our children. However, history shows that humanity's continuing quest to better understand the physical universe has always lead to new technologies to benefit our civilization.

"Individuals and organizations alike now have access to more data than ever, from a variety of sources ranging from databases to the web and digital media. Unfortunately, data is not the same thing as information. To make meaningful use of the data, users must sift through it, classify and structure it, also maintain it current. Such information management tasks have always been important for managers and knowledge workers. As the amount and variety of available data continues to grow, this form of management will become ever more demanding and ever more critical. 



The basic hypothesis of this research is that advances in information modeling and knowledge engineering have made it possible to develop integrated technologies along with methodologies which can greatly facilitate

the management of data and turn it into useful information.



Our research over the next five years will focus on two topics, one related to software engineering, the other to information modeling and knowledge management. On the first topic, we propose to continue work on a

software development methodology for agent-oriented software (the Tropos project). Our approach adopts concepts such as ""agent"", ""goal"" and (inter-agent) ""dependency"" to specify requirements and designs for agent-oriented software. This work will result in a systematic method for building software thast can communicate, negotiate, plan and adapt to address stakeholder requirements in a dynamic, open operating environment. On the second topic, we propose to conduct research that extends existing methodologies for designing databases. We also propose to work on novel theories of conceptual models and modelling that combine Logical and Category-theoretic approaches to address syntactic and semantic issues for models.

"Project 1: Finding the Torus Obstructions- A torus is a surface shaped like a doughnut. A topological obstruction for the torus is a graph G with minimum degree three that is not embeddable on the torus but for all edges e, G-e embeds on the torus. A minor order obstruction has the additional property that for all edges e, G contract e embeds on the torus. To date, we have found 249,227 topological obstructions and 17,354 minor order obstructions. The aims of our future research are to check the previous results using independent computations, to develop better computational tools so that the search can be extended, to search for patterns in the known obstructions so that they can expressed more succinctly, to generate and prove conjectures regarding the complete set of obstructions, and to use the insights gained for developing practical algorithms for torus embedding.



Project 2: Graph Algorithms for Fullerene Chemistry- Fullerenes are all-carbon molecules whose structures correspond to 3-regular planar graphs with face sizes five or six. This discrete molecular form of carbon was unknown before 1985, but now fullerenes and their relatives the carbon nanotubes have a chemistry and physics that is described in thousands of papers in the literature, with potential applications from materials science to medicine all being driven by their unusual combination of properties. There are various graph theoretical properties which are of direct interest to chemists. Working in collaboration with a theoretical chemist, a system called FuiGui (Fullerene Interactive Graphical User Interface) has been developed to faciliate research on the graphs which represent fullerenes. The goals of this research are to continue development of the FuiGui research tool and to apply it to provide further insight to fullerene chemistry.

"Today we are witnessing rapid changes in the Arctic because of global warming: in August of this year (2007), the sea ice extent was at its lowest ever since the late 1970s, when satellite measurements became routine.  With a continuing downward trend in the sea ice cover, a seasonal-free Arctic Ocean is a real possibility in a few decades.  On the longer timescale (one-to-two thousand years), the Earth will likely enter a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene, characterized by a much warmer planet, a very long-lasting interglacial, and greatly altered hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles.  



The SHORT-TERM OBJECTIVES of my proposed research program for the next one-to-three years are:

-    to obtain a deeper understanding of the nature and causes of Arctic sea ice changes on interannual-to-decadal timescales, past, present and future;

-    to investigate how these changes impact on lower-latitude climate and ocean circulation.

The LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES of my research over the next five years are

-    to investigate the processes and mechanisms in the Earth system that are involved in the long-term transition of the Earth's climate from the current Holocene to the Anthropocene epoch;

-    to study the nature and causes of past warm climates which could be analogues of future climates.

To ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, I shall develop and apply Earth system models of reduced complexity and dynamical system models to conduct various high-latitude and global climate process studies on short and long timescales.  The advantages of these models are that they can be used (a) to simulate hundreds to thousands of years of climate history, and also (b) to conduct many sensitivity studies.  Further, the models will incorporate both the geophysical and biospheric aspects of the Earth system, and hence will yield important information on changes to the Earth's hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles.

"The object of my study are Riemannian manifolds, which can be regarded as a generalization of surfaces in three-dimensional

space for higher dimensions. I am interested in Riemannian manifolds that have an ""optimal"" shape, that is, are less curved than all nearby Riemannian manifolds. My other object of study

is geodesics on Riemannian manifolds. Geodesics are the straightest lines on Riemannian manifolds. (For example, geodesics on a plane are straight lines, geodesics on the

round sphere are big circles, and so on). It is known that if a manifold is closed (like a sphere or a torus), then every two points can be connected by infinitely many distinct geodesics. These geodesics become longer and longer. I beleive and will try to prove that for every n one can

estimate the length of the nth of these geodesics in terms of n and the maximal distance between points on the manifold. But no information about curvature of the manifold is necessary here. Finally, I am going to study shapes of closed geodesic nets.

Mathematically, wave propagation is modeled by Partial Differential Equations and the class of problems considered in the proposed research consists in determining the coefficients of such and equation (which encode the unknown medium properties), from available measurements of the solutions (the waves). Several breakthroughs in the analytical understanding of such problems have uncovered a beautiful underlying mathematical structure and have led to an explosion of activity in the field. There has been considerable progress, yet some fundamental and difficult problems remain open. My research will attempt to understand some of these analytic problems. I will also work in collaboration with researchers in engineering towards the development of next generation medical diagnostic instrumentation for imaging electric properties of tissue.

"The global installed capacity of wind turbines have been steadily increasing over the past decade along with a continuously declining price of electricity. While viable wind turbine sites with very high quality wind resources still exist, improved turbine technology and cost reduction can expand the number of locations that are economically attractive. The proposed work investigates the multidisciplinary nature of wind turbine design and analysis with the goal of reducing the end unit cost of electricity production for a particular location, while maintaining acceptable noise levels. On 28 June 2006 the Canadian Wind Energy Association reported that Canada surpassed the 1000 Megawatts (MW) installed wind energy capacity and was the 12th. country to do so [CWE Association 2006]. Wind energy is emerging to be a key choice among countries' energy plans around the world. Installed wind power capacity has been increasing at a rate of 28.7% and reached 60,000 MW in 2005 with global revenues at $15 billion CAD [Industrial Canada 2005]. In Canada, we have seen an annual increase of 38% since 2000 and wind farms are pro jected to produce 5,600 MW installed capacity by 2012 requiring a total investment of $8.4 billion CAD and providing an estimated 13,000 jobs [Industrial Canada 2005]. Engineers and scientist will comprise 14.3% of the 13,000 new jobs, requiring an estimated 1859 professionals in this field by 2012 [Industrial Canada 2005]. The objective of this research program is to develop an industrial-strength multidisciplinary analysis and design (MDO) framework for the design of wind turbine blades, and use this framework to find novel ultra-quiet blade geometries that exhibit efficiencies even higher than the current state of the art. In order to increase the public acceptance of wind energy due to its perceived noise related issues, Canada must embark on an ambitious agenda to train highly qualified personnel and develop new technologies that will address unique challenges for wind energy installations in Canada as well as to compete in the global market.","Alternative energy resources","McGill University",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Mod�lisation, simulation et m�thodes des �l�ments finis","G�nie m�canique"

Wind farms in Canada, especially the province of Quebec experience severe cold climates, icing, and heavy snow falls. These environmental issues are generally not addressed significantly in current industrial designs. Therefore, Canada must initiate and take a lead in the development of new technologies to design and manufacture wind turbine blades that will address unique challenges for wind energy installations in Canada as well as to compete in the global market.



The objective of this research program is to develop and advance the necessary algorithms for the design of wind turbine blades.  The starting point of this work is the experience of the principal investigator, in the field of Aerodynamic Shape Optimization (ASO) using control theory-based adjoint methods. In this research program, we propose to extend the method for the design of wind turbine blades. To resolve these new challenges, new algorithmic developments will be explored and initiated.

"Quantum dots have been used in biological applications as an alternative to fluorescent dyes because of their stability, brightness, and wide range of colours.  However, these semiconductor nanocrystals also possess other properties that make them potentially useful as a whole new class of nanoscale biosensors: those that turn off and on (or change colour) in response to a specific process within  a cell.  In our previous work, we defined the types of biologically-relevant processes that might result in alterations of quantum dot fluorescence, and illustrated the use of quantum dots as sensors for redox potential within living cells.  In this work, we have two specific aims: (1) to use these general principles to create a sensor for cellular membrane potential and ion flux. We will apply this to the specific case of a bacterial sodium channel, with the eventual goal of using the sensor to probe action potentials. We will determine the exact photophysical mechanisms behind the fluorescence changes seen, and thus to enable the easier creation of new classes of nanoparticle-based sensors. (2) To measure quantum dot fluorescence intermittency (""blinking"") as the particles encounter living cells, are taken up, travel to different intracellular locations, and are processed. This may allow the phenomenon of blinking to be used as a truly nanoscale probe of intracellular conditions.

"One of the greatest capacities our brains possess is the ability to store memories that can last a lifetime.  Memory consolidation theory posits that new memories initially enter a labile state called short term memory (STM) and through the production of new proteins can be transformed into long term memories (LTM).  This process is posited to take place only once for each memory. Recently I have shown that following retrieval, consolidated memories require new proteins synthesis in a brain structure called the amygdala in order for them to persist.  In other words, the mechanisms involved in the storage of new memories seem to be recapitulated when old memories are reactivated.  This phenomenon is called reconsolidation.  

We propose to utilize the phenomema of memory reconsolidation to ask questions about how different but related memories are stored in the brain; whether they are they stored in overlapping or separate populations of neurons.  For example, if you have grown up eating mangoes, are all the memories of mangoes stored together as a single memory, or is every incidence stored separately?  By exploiting the fact that memories undergo reconsolidation, we have a developed a paradigm to test this issue at the behavioral level and by visualizing the activity of individual neurons in the brain.  The proposed experiments will help us begin to understand under what conditions memories are stored together and when they are not.  

In addition, when reconsolidation is blocked one, one possibility is that the memory representation is erased.  In other words, the memory is unwired from the brain.  Thus, we will identify some of the molecular mechanisms thought to be critical for wiring the memory into the brain in the first place.  We will then block reconsolidation and then see if the wiring mechanisms have been undone.  Conversely, we can enhance reconsolidation and see if we have strengthened the wiring of the memory into the brain.

"In recent years, plain woven fabric made of high strength, lightweight fiber has been utilized in a variety of engineering applications ranging from ballistic shields (e.g., soft body armor, aircraft fuselage barriers) to high-performance flexible systems (e.g., parachutes, airbags and sails). In particular, fabric materials with extremely high strength-to-weight ratio, such as Kevlar and Zylon, are rapidly becoming mainstays in ballistic impact and penetration technologies. The mechanical properties of fabric depend crucially on the underlying microstructure, which is determined by the material properties of single constituent yarns and the geometry of the fabric weaving. In this work, the applicant will continue to develop a multi-scale model to predict the failure and damage mechanism of fabric materials. A failure of fabric used in safety applications will have catastrophic results. It was previously shown by the applicant that the multi-scale approach is applicable for analyzing deformation and stresses in fabric material. The multi-scale model provides a detailed stress state of the underlaying microstructure which in the case of fabric is made of woven yarns. The results of this work will allow to design a safer and lighter systems based on fabrics. The development of a theoretical model for mechanical behavior of materials and structure has significant importance. From the engineering point of view a theoretical model allows a designer a better understanding of the important phenomena taking place. Since a theoretical model use mathematics as a language which is free of physical limitation. Using a mathematical model permits the designer to measure quantities which cannot be measured in experiment. A mathematical model permits robust process of seeking optimization to the design. Moreover, the cost of theoretical investigation in small, since the development of a theoretical model will be followed by numerical simulations using only computers. When the theoretical and numerical studies reach maturity it should be integrated into experimental study. The cost of the experiment research is significantly reduced since large portion of the analysis was already performed numerically.","Fibres and textiles","University of Alberta",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","M�canique des solides","G�nie m�canique"

"Magnetic hard disk drives are widespread and indispensable storage media nowadays. The storage media has been widely used in various applications ranging from lap-top computers, mobile audio players, car navigation, to security and communication systems. A current goal of the magnetic disk drive industry is to break the 1 tera-bit per square inch storage density barrier, which imposes a stringent performance specification for the conventional single-stage disk drive servo. To meet the challenge, several dual-stage actuation schemes have been proposed. All these proposals, however, lead to a multivariable servo system for which conventional scalar design techniques become inadequate to fully exploit the potential of that system. Thus, it is imperative to come up with appropriate design methodologies for the dual-stage multi-sensing system, in which optimal, robust performance is pursued in an explicit and systematic way. This proposal is a response to this need. 

The proposed work aims to apply robust control theory to track-following control for dual-stage multi-sensing systems and to develop a comprehensive user-friendly software package utilizing our controller design procedures. The ultimate goal is to invent a universal robust servo design technique applicable to control problems in various fields of engineering and science.

The proposed design methodologies will provide industrial servo engineers with a guideline principle on how to realize simple control mechanisms with high quality and thus, it has a potential to help engineers in the servo design for specific disk drive products. The comprehensive, effective, and user-friendly software package will greatly facilitate the complicated design process. Based on the hardware configuration and design specifications, the engineers will have the freedom to compare those methodologies from various aspects and finally select one that suits their design needs. Other applications in areas such as aerospace engineering, medicine, biology, and economics, will also benefit from the outcome of this research, since many problems in these areas are mathematically similar to that in the disk drive servo.

"Stochastic inventory management is one of the fundamental areas of research and practice in operations management and management science. The main research questions of interest in this field are about determining optimal inventory and capacity related decisions in a wide set of instances which are of great significance to the economy. These decisions enable firms to hold the right inventory at the right location at the right time. The importance of such decisions cannot be underestimated as almost 11% of the Canadian GNP is spent on logistical activities that involve moving and storing physical inventory. In today's economic climate with rising fuel prices, making optimal decisions and reducing waste is particularly crucial.  Thus, good research in this field often directly helps practitioners cut costs and improve profitability and improve social surplus. Despite its maturity as a research area, as of today, there are large classes of problem settings which pose significant theoretical and practical challenges.  In this research, I propose to study a set of inventory problems, for which little is known in terms of the structure or algorithms that compute the near-optimal policies. For these problems, my research will construct approximation algorithms which will result in policies that are relatively easy to implement, that will yield close to optimal performance under a wide set of realistic instances and often offer an understanding of the worst case performance. In this process, important properties of the optimal policy will also be understood. The settings I am particularly interested include multiple sourcing, perishable products, large scale multi stage capacitated systems,  multiple products which are partial substitutes of each other and with capacity constraints and settings with random yield.

"Many processes in nature, technology and culture can be described mathematically as systems that evolve in time.  The flows of fluids, the weather and climate, vibrations of machinery, solidification of alloys, the development of plant and animal embryos, the spread of diseases or introduced plant or animal species or cultural practices, and the perfomance of an investment portfolio are only a few examples of processes that can be described mathematically as systems that evolve in time.  Patterns in space or time may develop, or the behaviour may appear to be unpredictable or ""chaotic"" in the long term even when well-understood deterministic rules govern the evolution of the process in the short term.  Mathematical theory helps us to understand, predict, and in some cases control the behaviour of these processes.



The theory of dynamical systems studies the behaviour of mathematical systems that evolve in time.  While much is known about dynamical systems, many important theoretical questions remain unanswered.  Development of the theory provides more analytical techniques and tools that can be used to predict behaviour of mathematical models that describe processes in nature or technology.  Analytical techniques, sometimes combined with numerical methods, can be used in applications to give predictions that complement those from direct simulation using computer models.  Often the analytical methods provide information precisely in those situations where simulation is expensive or impractical.  Theory can also be used to make simulations more efficient, and can be used to explain results from simulations that at first are confusing or contradictory.



My research area is in dynamical systems and applications.  Some of my research attempts to answer theoretical questions, and the rest of my research involves applications of dynamical systems theory and methods to models of morphogenesis, ecology, fluid flows and atmospheric circulation.

"Thermally conducting, but electrically insulating, polymer composites are increasingly important for electronic packaging because the heat dissipation ability limits the reliability, performance, and miniaturization of electronics. 

In the applications which require higher thermal conductivity, such as in electronic packaging and encapsulations, satellite devices, die (chip) attach, electric cable insulation, and in areas where good heat dissipation, low thermal expansion and light weight are needed, polymers reinforced with fillers are becoming more and more common in producing advanced polymer composites for these applications

There is no one material that has characteristics that satisfy all of the requirements hence a number of researchers have been designing composite materials that can provide enhanced properties. The long term objective of this research program is to develop a methodology that can be used to tailor make a composite material that satisfies a number of multifunctional requirements. This will lay the foundation for an innovative break-through in the field of thermally conductive materials. In this context, the short term objectives of this research are 1) to design and develop a process for the manufacture of thermally conductive polymeric materials and blends with superior functional properties; 2) to measure the fundamental properties of thermally conductive polymers including the thermal, physical, rheological and dielectric properties that influence their processing and their functionality; 3) to integrate and optimize the final properties of these thermally conductive polymers into predesigned prototypes; 4) to develop a computer user interface for the design and selection of thermally conductive polymers.","Manufacturing processes and products","University of Toronto",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Transformation des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"
"The overall aim of this research program is to advance the fundamental understanding of the nanocellular biopolymer design, which is a key parameter in the development of new fabrication techniques and process technologies for these novel materials. For decades, extensive effort has been put into developing new techniques to fabricate nanoporous polymers. Nanocellular polymers can have significant improvement of the physical, mechanical and biological properties compared to coventional cellular polymers. Potential applications include engineered bioscaffolds, drug delivery systems, high weight to load ratio components, thermal and acoustic insulating materials, micro and nanofluidics platforms and in components used in micro and nano actuators and sensors. 



The long term objective of this research is the development of novel nanocellular biopolymers using 3D nano-patterning techniques with controlled cell morphologies in the range of 10 - 100 nm.  In this context, the short term objectives of this research are four folds: (i) design and development of manufacturing technology for nanocellular biopolymers; (ii) characterization of pre-processing properties for nanocellular biopolymers; (iii) analysis of post-processing nanocellular biopolymers behaviors and; (iv) modeling and optimization of nanocellular biopolymer properties.","Manufacturing processes and products","University of Toronto",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie m�canique","G�nie m�canique"

"With the availability of the human and mouse genome sequences and a nearly completed identification of genes, we are now facing the next challenge; the functional annotation of the gene products, the proteins. To achieve a deeper understanding of our biology, and for more efficient interventions with disease processes, there is an ever-increasing demand for production of proteins in large quantities. This is usually done by the use of transgenic bacterial or mammalian cells. In order to ensure proper processing of mammalian proteins, the latter is preferred. Transgene expression in mammalian cell lines however is subject to huge variations in terms of the level and reliability of protein production. Thus, the current methodologies require screening of large numbers of transgenic cell lines (established to produce the same protein) for an optimal genomic insertion site of the transgene so that this providing the highest and most efficient and reliable production can be found. This selection process is cumbersome and requires high investments of time, labor and monetary resources.

    )	We have developed a means of total control of transgene insertion into a defined genomic site (docking site) in mouse Embryonic Stem cells, and this system has now successfully passed the proof-of-principle stage. Here we propose to translate this technology to protein producing cell lines and to identify sub-lines with optimum docking sites. This would in turn alleviate the burden of those screening processes needed with the methods used currently. Such an improvement is expected to have unprecedented impact on proteomics research and protein based drug manufacturing.

"A family of proteins called connexins form channels at contacts between cellular plasma membranes and allow the flow of ions and small molecules from cell to cell. These channels aggregate to form structures called gap junctions, which play essential roles in a broad range of cellular functions in many organs of the body. When gap junctions occur between electrically excitable cells, including neurons in the brain where these junctions are composed of connexin36, they form what are called electrical synapses. Unlike chemical synapses, electrical synapses mediate direct electrical communication between neurons. Although it was thought for a long time that very few electrical synapses exist in higher animals, recent studies have revealed both the prevalence and functional importance of gap junctions forming these synapses in many regions of mammalian brain. Because it is now accepted that electrical synapses play a crucial role in brain cognitive functions, it is easy to imagine that malfunction of these synapses could contribute to mental disorders. Research in Nagy's group is focused on acquiring knowledge about biochemical processes that control the formation and maintenance of neuronal gap junctions, and that regulate their capacity to transmit electrical signals. This includes studies aimed to identify proteins that are physically associated with neuronal gap junctions and to elucidate mechanisms whereby some of these proteins contribute to the assembly and disassembly of gap junctions. One protein of particular focus is called LNX1, which Nagy's group believes may contribute to the removal of connexin36 from neuronal gap junctions. They have devised strategies to test the idea that this removal occurs by physical interaction of LNX1 with connexin36, followed by modification of connexin36 structure, leading to the breakdown or degradation of this connexin. This work will provide understanding of the basic biochemical machinery that governs the operation of electrical synapses, which will allow considerations of ways these synapses could malfunction to cause diseases.

"Complex cellular and molecular interactions that occur at the neuronal synapse are critical for learning and memory processes to occur in the mammalian brain. Synapses in the rat hippocampus are undeniably a key component in forming spatial and emotionally tagged memories. Their function has been shown to be impaired in stress-related memory disorders, hypoxia/ischemia, neuropathologies like Alzheimer's disease and following teratogen exposure. Conversely, synapse function can be enhanced by minor stressors like exercise or exposure to enriched environments. Despite our growing knowledge of how dynamic synapses in the hippocampus can be, the ultrastructural basis of these dynamics is still poorly understood. Understanding the building blocks and structural properties of these synapses are crucial to further our knowledge of neuronal function. The present study will examine how prenatal stress alters the ultrastructure of hippocampal neurons in the developing brain. We will examine the hippocampus using immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy at different developmental time points (7, 35 and 60 days postnatal). Both light microscopy and serial transmission electron microscopy sectioning methods will be used to quantify alterations in neuronal density, dendritic arborization, axonal targets, dendritic spine distribution, synaptic vesicle density, organelle content, and structure and composition of the pre- and post-synaptic densities. These data will be compared between ages and between sexes of the offspring.  A second set of studies using hippocampal primary neuronal cultures derived from day 7 animals will be used to ascertain whether prenatal stress affects the in vitro growth and maturation of hippocampal neurons and whether neurons are affected permanently or transiently as a result of prenatal stress.The outcome of this research will provide new information on the primary structure and plasticity of hippocampal neurons affected by prenatal stress at both the in vivo and in vitro levels.  It will also provide a framework to develop new testable models to study neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and hippocampal function.

"The past few years have witnessed drastically increased interest in technological systems to improve security,

through the prevention of catastrophic events. Concurrently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have come of

age in military applications as a means of providing covert surveillance without risk to humans, and have

proved hugely successful in this application. Finally, the past few years have also seen a resurgence of interest

in lighter-than-air craft due to their broad benefits in applications requiring long endurance hovering flight.

The research proposed here is intended to advance the state of knowledge relating to highly maneuverable

lighter-than-air vehicles (a.k.a. airships) and apply it to surveillance and the mitigation and prevention of

natural and human-induced disasters. The motivation for using this type of UAV is multifold: lighter-than air

vehicles consume no energy to stay aloft, except in the presence of winds; new design approaches have the

potential to lead to vehicles that are highly capable, and less susceptible to ambient winds; the vehicles are

inherently safe over urban areas because they typically do not fail catastrophically as might a fixed-wing

aircraft. Moreover, relative to helicopters, airships are relatively noiseless and inexpensive to operate.

The applications addressed here are those that would benefit from an occasional or persistent aerial

surveillance capability. These include (a) fire detection and firefighting support; (b) monitoring of warehouses

and hangars; (c) toxic leak monitoring; (d) support of police operations; and (e) border monitoring. These

applications require the ability to place sensors, such as cameras, infrared, chemical sensors aloft, with humans

out of harm's way and with a large field of view. Although the platforms considered here may be teleoperated,

modern computing capabilities allow autonomous control in which the vehicle makes its own decisions, for

example in tracking a toxic plume or an intruder.",Aerospace,"McGill University",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","G�nie a�rospatial, a�ronautique et automobile","G�nie m�canique"
"My research group studies the dynamics and control of aerial and underwater vehicles; both untethered and tethered. We have investigated systems as varied as towed underwater vehicles, a novel design for a radio telescope, and a paddling underwater robot. We construct computer simulations of these systems and confirm those simulations through experiment. This then allows the simulations to be used to improve the system design. Our interest in tethered systems and structures arises because they are widely used and known to have desirable characteristics such as high payload to weight ratios. In the structural domain, they are known as 'tension structures' and are used in the design of buildings, roofs and towers. More recently, they have attracted the interest of researchers and designers of controllable mechanisms. In particular, when the cable (tether) lengths of the system are actively controlled using winches, they can be used as robots, cranes, and telescope mechanisms. These sytems become especially interesting when multiple cables are used together to stabilize or control a platform. Often, this platform is buoyant, such as in the case of an aerostat or an offshore oil platform.



The subject of this application is the study of the dynamics and control of multitethered systems, with application to offshore oil platforms; telescope pointing mechanisms; and submerged buoys and turbines. Some of the research will also have relevance to cable-actuated parallel robot manipulators. We will study the behavior of these unique systems in order to synthesize guidelines for optimizing their design. We will look at features such as the placement of the attachment points on the ground and on the platform, as well as the cable and platform properties. Our main goal will be to minimize the motion of the platform in the presence of random disturbances such as wind and waves. We will also investigate methods for the control of these systems. This can be very challenging because the flexibility and length of the cables can cause large delays in transmission of the control forces.

"In this proposal, we seek to provide novel solutions to problems in gathering data from a variety of sensors deployed in homes. Those sensors report three kinds of data: (T1) safety-critical data, (T2) data with economic value, and (T3) data for planning and management information. The first kind of data comes from monitoring physical phenomena (e.g. fire and gas) and body-mounted sensors for health monitoring of patients. The second kind of data comes from all the utility meters (electricity, gas, and water). The third kind of data comes from other kinds of sensors (e.g. heat loss through windows). We will design application-specific wireless networks to gather data from home environment. The work will involve network topology control, routing and scheduling of data, and transport protocols for broadcasting and geocasting in large sensor networks with mobile sensors with real energy constraints. When developing strategies for home sensor networks, we must consider that different kinds of sensors have different application requirements (T1-T3), some sensors (e.g. body-mounted sensors) are mobile, and the application-level data must be transported with high reliability. These requirements cannot always be fulfilled at the same time. Therefore, trade-offs have to be analyzed with respect to different performance metrics. Efficiency, scalability, reliability, energy constraints, and application-specific designs are the criteria for topology control, scheduling and routing, and transport protocols that are applicable to real sensor networks. Developing such protocols and smart power supplies for sensors are the primary goals of this project. Research results from the project will provide the following benefits: (i) utility companies will have a scalable, reliable, and inexpensive way to gather data for micromanagement of their resources; (ii) health-care providers will receive real-time data from patients; and (iii) home owners will be notified about security and energy efficiency of their homes.  The project will produce intellectual property in the field of advanced wireless sensor networks for monitoring of complex systems.

This will enable the overall cost of the systems to be reduced. The new circuits will also increase the portability of such systems by greatly extending their battery life.

"Service robots are used in many applications ranging from professional use, such as space and underwater exploration, defense, security, medicine, inspection and maintenance, to personal use such as house keeping, lawn mowing and entertainment. Recent market studies in North America, Japan and Europe have predicted a significant market growth for almost any kind of service robots in the next decade. However, the examination of typical service robots reveals that major advances in certain core technologies are indispensable before the service robots become sufficiently reliable for wide commercial use. Among these technologies, low-cost solutions for fast and accurate localization in unstructured environments are of utmost importance mainly because of two reasons. First, localization is a precursor to autonomous operation; and second, service robots must usually transmit information about their instantaneous position in the task space. This proposal outlines the steps toward the development of a computationally viable 3D visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) method for service robots. The research will focus on three key issues: computational complexity, data association, and representation of unstructured environments. The applicant has specified two strategies to tackle these three problems. One strategy focuses on the development of a priori information-based SLAM to facilitate large-scale mapping and fast localization of dynamic landmarks, which are of great importance to not only individual service robots but also sensor network of a group of cooperative robots. The second strategy focuses on the application of sensor and data fusion to the state-space (full-form) and canonical (information-form) SLAM to improve the estimation quality and robustness of the map updating process. The two strategies will converge to develop and implement a VSLAM method with unprecedented accuracy, reliability, and computational efficiency. The VSLAM method will be initially developed using a hardware-in-the-loop simulator and verified by a real robot. The successful results of this research will promote a wide range of applications in defense, manufacturing, construction, and surgical equipment industries.

"The cellular environment is a crowded, unforgiving environment far from the controlled conditions encountered in test tubes. From a thermodynamic point of view, in these conditions, there should be competition between proteins for small-molecules and vice versa. The extent to which this occurs is influenced by the evolution of protein function, that requires not only the ability to bind specific small molecules but also the mechanisms to keep in check the competition. This phenomenon of small-molecule/protein binding promiscuity has been largely ignored over the years and it is crucial in improving our knowledge of molecular recognition, evolution and cellular function. The proposed research program will develop the tools and resources necessary to study the structural causes and control mechanisms of small-molecule protein binding promiscuity at a systems level. The primary objectives of the proposed research program are: 1. The development of methods for the detection of binding site similarities 2: The development of methods for the simulation of dynamic aspects of protein function, and 3. The mapping of experimental and modelled protein structural information into reconstructed metabolic networks to integrate structural and systems biology and use of the methods developed to understand molecular recognition and exploit it in drug design. The novelty of the research plan lies in the powerful new methods proposed and their use to understanding molecular recognition from a structural systems biology point of view. The proposed research plan will develop and integrate structural computational biology tools as well as bio- and chemo-informatics resources and represents a new paradigm for understanding molecular recognition. The interdisciplinary nature of this program will contribute to the formation of students from diverse backgrounds to work at the interface of chemistry, molecular biology, physics and computer sciences.

"The ever increasing demand for bandwidth and information management is necessitating newer generations of electronic circuits and systems that operate at higher frequencies and with sharper excitations. With the increasing signal-speed and decreasing feature sizes, high-frequency effects become the dominant factors limiting overall performance of microelectronic and communication systems. Also the desire for multifunction and miniature products warrant mixed-domain integration of heterogeneous circuit components such as analog, digital, RF, microwave and optical devices. As a result, advanced simulation and design methodologies become increasingly indispensable in achieving the next generation of wireless and wireline communication networks. However, the existing computer-aided design tools and techniques do not adequately handle the large-scale, mixed-domain problems and concurrent analysis needs. This is mainly because they are sequential in nature and are designed for single processor platforms. A paradigm shift is required in the development of the CAD methodologies to exploit the rapidly emerging parallel computing platforms, so as to meet the high-frequency design needs.

The proposed research will develop parallel computer-aided design tools and algorithms targeting large-scale, mixed-domain and high-frequency designs. The new research is built on the recent breakthroughs in design automation. Comprehensive frameworks will be developed to serve as the foundation for next generation of simulation, modeling and optimization tools that are fast, accurate and concurrent. The proposed research will develop technologies that stimulate innovations in communications and information processing. The work will be carried out in close interaction with Canadian industry, strengthening Canadian competitiveness in next generation electronic products and communication networks.","Information, computer and communication technologies","Carleton University",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Micro�lectronique","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"

"Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that regulates a variety of plant processes including seed maturation and avoidance/adaptation to abiotic and biotic stresses. Therefore, elucidation of molecular mechanisms that regulate endogenous ABA level is the key to modify seed qualities and to produce stress tolerant plants. The level of ABA is fine-tuned by the functions of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases (NCEDs) and ABA 8'-hydroxylases (CYP707As), rate-limiting enzymes of ABA biosynthesis and catabolism, respectively. These enzymes are localized in particular cell types and affect plants' systemic responses in a non-cell autonomous manner. Consequently, unidentified ABA transport machineries from ABA-synthesizing cells to responding cells are also essential for the functions of this hormone. The focus of this research proposal is to identify and functionally characterize the regulation of this hormone levels in each plant cell and ultimately to uncover how plants sense and respond to the changing environment.","Plant production and plant primary products","University of Toronto",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Physiologie du stress","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres"

"In calcified tissues, noncollagenous proteins are dispersed throughout the extracellular matrix and although they represent minor constituents, they exert major regulatory influences on the deposition of mineral and the activity of the cells responsible for the formation of the tissue. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which implicated proteins express their function is the next challenge scientists face in understanding how the body functions and how disease alters this pattern. Despite the relative abundance of biochemical data on noncollagenous proteins, their precise role in vivo, where the whole animal biology comes into play, remains to be determined. Information on the activities and properties of these proteins has been largely deduced from their temporo-spatial pattern of expression and often tested experimentally using in vitro systems in which, at most, few parameters can be evaluated at a time. Gene transfer will be used to create local transgenic conditions in a rat model of intramembranous bone formation and examine the role of specific functional domains of major noncollagenous bone matrix proteins. This approach offers a simple system in which portion and domains of a molecule can be tested for function and therapeutic potential in an environment that reflects the complex nature of the body. Such an approach is less time consuming and costly then creating a knockout

or a transgenic animal for each of the protein to be tested. These gene transfer studies are expected not only to provide unique fundamental information on the function of matrix molecule, on challenging scientific problems in the field of calcified tissues but also to have an impact on the engineering of novel therapeutic

agents, with optimal action and application in prevention and treatment of bone and tooth-related diseases.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Universit� de Montr�al",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Biologie cellulaire","Biologie cellulaire"

"Over the years, the IP network has grown to a very complex distributed system with control protocols and forwarding plane mechanisms at routers and switches. IP networking protocols and forwarding plane mechanisms are changing all the time to address user application requirements and operating environments. However, all this time there was no significant advancement in control and management of IP networks.



The objective of the proposed research is two fold:  First, to improve control and management capabilities of IP networks using improved visibility of network states, share information from control and forwarding planes, and run a set of algorithms for intelligent decision making to facilitate configuration management. Second, the proposed research will address control and management requirements of next generation secured, traffic engineered and virtual networks based on already developed mechanisms and newly defined operations and management architectures.

"Loads from earthquakes and other extreme events can cause serious damage to civil infrastructure. For example, the projected loss from a design level earthquake in the city of Vancouver is $3 billion. Structures equipped with supplemental devices, called smart structures, have the potential to significantly reduce damage. However, to benefit from the gains, we must first learn how best to apply these devices and maximize their reliability.     



Semiactive control is an attractive means to provide structural control due to its reliability and low energy needs. Semiactive control uses strategically placed dampers, with control algorithms to adjust them effectively. In order to integrate this new technology in new and existing structures, it is critical to develop reliable and effective algorithms robust to nonlinearities, uncertainties in structural properties, and deterioration, all of which commonly occur in structures. The development of such adaptive semiactive control techniques is the main objective of the proposed research. This objective will be achieved by theoretical analyses, development of control algorithms, and computer simulations that account for, and address, commonly observed nonlinearities and uncertainties in structures. Popular semiactive devices, such as magnetorheological dampers and friction dampers will be used to develop and carry out the appropriate control strategies. The applicant's previous research on control of base isolated buildings has resulted in several sophisticated simulation programs that will be extended to implement the new concepts and algorithms sought in this research program.



The techniques and understanding this project seeks to develop would represent a significant advance in the design of new structures, retrofitting existing structures, and an important step towards reducing the risk to the society due to natural hazards.

"The Neoproterozoic (1000-542 million years ago) was an era of profound change in the Earth system.  Large-scale changes in the physical and chemical environment of Earth, including break-up of a supercontinent and a series of extreme global ice ages, occurred in concert with equally fundamental changes in the evolution of life.  Over the next five years my students and I will carry out research on the appearance of the first animals and other large creatures on Earth (as represented by the Ediacara Biota) and on the evolution of carbonate systems towards modern-style systems, including early reefs.  Most of my research efforts will focus on the Ediacara Biota (578-542 million years ago).  These soft-bodied creatures that appeared at the end of the Neoproterozoic ice ages mark ""when life got big"" after 3 billion years of mostly microbial evolution, and represent the oldest large, complex life forms anywhere.  Almost all of them were entirely soft-bodied, without any evidence of skeletons, muscles, guts, or brains.  Some Ediacaran forms may have been stem-groups that led to all modern animal life; others appear to represent ""failed experiments"" in the evolution of life.  Our studies will focus on Newfoundland, which contains the oldest and some of the best preserved Ediacaran assemblages known anywhere.   Investigating deep-water Ediacaran assemblages from NW Canada will help to assess the global character of the fossils.  Searches for as yet undiscovered Ediacaran fossils below the main fossil levels in Newfoundland and Australia will test the roles of glaciation and oxygenation in the evolution of large animals   I also will study carbonates from NW Canada and Australia that were deposited between the two greatest Proterozoic ice ages (Cryogenian, about 750-635 million years ago) to document the effects of biotic evolution and global climate change on the development of carbonate systems through the Proterozoic Eon.   These studies will form the core of my research activities and will provide support and research materials for 3 MSc students, 2 PhD students, a PDF, and 13 undergraduate field assistants over the next five years.

"Mitochondria are small organelles that exist within all cells of higher organisms. They perform many vital functions but are best known as sites of energy production. For this reason they are sometimes called ""the powerhouse of the cell"". Mitochondria contain many proteins and a few of these are coded by DNA that is housed within mitochondria. However, the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by genes that exist in the nucleus of the cell. Thus, communication must occur from mitochondria to the nucleus to insure the proper expression of those genes necessary for mitochondrial formation and function. My lab is attempting to identify the molecules that are used to enable this communication. As a model system we use a fungal protein called ""alternative oxidase"" which is encoded by a nuclear gene that is normally not expressed. However, when normal mitochondrial function is perturbed, the protein becomes highly expressed in response to signals emanating from the malfunctioning mitochondria which are sent to the nucleus. We study mutants that are unable to perform the signaling and attempt to identify the molecules or mechanisms that are disrupted in the mutants. We also hope to determine the nature of the molecule(s) that initiate the signaling process. Elucidation of the mechanism of alternative oxidase expression should serve as a general model for signaling from mitochondria to the nucleus.","Advancement of knowledge","University of Alberta",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","R�gulation des g�nes","Biologie mol�culaire"

"During the past decade, the small growth in the copper-wire access technology has been outpaced by the explosive growth of Internet traffic and the unprecedented levels of network capacity offered by backbone networks. Service providers are challenged with offering access solutions that are scalable, fast, and cost effective to ensure their competitive positions. Passive Optical Network (PON) technology can address these needs through the use of optical fibers in place of the traditional copper wire. It is here that Ethernet PON (EPON) has emerged as one of the most promising fiber-based access solutions that can deliver high-speed voice, data, and video services to residential, enterprise, and small/medium business customers. Providing this full range of services on an integrated platform requires for the EPON network to support network-level quality of service (QoS) and service differentiation. In particular, mechanisms for dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) must be found to ensure fair partitioning of network resources between different classes of service as well as spatial fairness between different customers. While there is a rich and solid research base for achieving fairness in wired/wireless networks, these approaches are inappropriate for shared PON channels because of the unique location-dependent nature of contention in such networks. Survivability mechanisms must also be incorporated into the EPON network in order to address the transport of mission-critical services and the growing commercial importance of the Internet. This project targets the design, implementation, and demonstration of an EPON system, which will support a diverse range of services with different bandwidth and QoS requirements. The proposed system has the potential to give Canadian communications network operators the benefits of scalability and efficiency of end-to-end all-optical networking. Economic growth and cost saving are the logical results of the proposed system. In particular, the advanced features of this new system will set a new standard for EPON performance, enabling network operators to provide efficient network utilization while supporting a range of revenue-generating, reliable, and fair multimedia services.

"The transmission of information between neurons in the brain is governed by the release of chemicals called ""neurotranmitters"" which bind to ion channels located on the surface of neurons.  The binding of neurotransmitters to ion channels transduces changes in electrical activity of the neuron via the flux of ions across the membrane.  The present study focuses on a class of ligand-gated ion channels called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.  alpha4beta2 is the most prevalent nicotinic receptor subtype in the CNS.  Our long term goal is to examine the basic function of nicotinic receptors in modulating neurotransmission in the CNS.  To address this issue we have produced three lines of knock-in mice, whereby a nicotinic receptor subunit (alpha4) was mutated to contain a fluorescent tag allowing us to localize the receptor in the CNS with exquisite detail.  One of the mouse lines also contains a gain-of-function mutation rendering nicotinic receptors with several fold larger nicotinic currents and 50 fold greater affinity to nicotine.  This mouse line will allow us to specifically target the receptor with very low concentrations of nicotinic agonist to unambiguously ascertain the receptor's function in physiology and behavioral experiments.  We plan to achieve our overall goal firstly by imaging the localization and quantifying nicotinic receptors in specific neurons in various brain regions by exploiting the alpha4 fluorescent mouse lines.  To our knowledge, these mice are the first knock-ins to express fluorescently tagged ion channels.  After mapping the location and quantifying the receptor we can then precisely target specific neurons for electrophysiological recordings and design intelligently the experiments to ascertain the function of the receptor in influencing neuronal excitability.  By knowing the precise quantity and subcellular localization and function of nicotinic receptors in specific neurons and circuits in the brain, we can then predict and test the role of the nicotinic receptor in modulating certain behaviors, such as reward, cognition and pain. We are also interested in understanding the function of other nicotinic receptor subtypes and we will produce fluorescently tagged alpha7 nicotinic receptors as a first step in this endeavor.

"The recent advances in high dynamic range (HDR) display devices promise to provide life-like picture quality, thanks to an improved luminance/color dynamic range over the existing conventional display technology. However, for these displays to widely penetrate the consumer market, it is necessary that other supporting technologies are also developed. The goal of this project is to develop a complete HDR video capturing, compression and transmission solution, which will support and complement the emerging HDR display technology and thus enable the HDR market. The novel aspects of our research are explained below: 1.Presently the market is dominated by Low Dynamic Range (LDR) display devices. Our proposed research will enable the generation of LDR backward compatible video from HDR content. Our generated LDR content should offer picture quality that is superior to that captured by existing LDR devices and traditional HDR to LDR conversion methods. Unlike existing methods, we will develop a compression-aware HDR-to-LDR tone-mapping algorithm that will jointly minimize the overall quantization losses, resulting from both tone-mapping and compression. 2.The HDR video content will be coded in a scalable video format that maximizes the picture quality and efficiently encodes each layer so that the overall bandwidth requirements are kept within industry-acceptable limits. This method will produce backward compatible LDR component and allow perfect reproduction of the HDR video. 3.At present, HDR video cameras are extremely expensive. To facilitate early market adoption of HDR technology, our research will provide highly cost-effective HDR video capturing solutions using regular LDR cameras. Unlike existing complicated approaches that use one LDR camera and suffer from temporal artifacts, we propose to use two synchronized LDR cameras to eliminate these artifacts and produce better HDR picture quality.","Information, computer and communication technologies","University of British Columbia",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Traitement des images","Technologie de l'information"
"Multiview video involves capturing 3D information from a scene, allowing exciting applications such as 3D TV and free viewpoint TV, while adding another dimension to surveillance and inspection by greatly increasing the accuracy of object recognition and tracking. Calibrating a large number of cameras is difficult, resulting in significant inconsistencies in brightness, colour, contrast and focus between the different views. These inconsistencies pose a number of problems in multiview systems, ranging from unpleasant visible mismatches for the viewers as they switch between different viewpoints to decreased efficiency in compression, rendering and tracking. The objective of our research is to develop digital pre-processing methods for correcting inconsistencies in multiview video sets, thus improving video coding performance and 3D display quality. Specifics include:

Colour Correction: Modifying the colour of multiview video sets to be consistent across all cameras.  Matching colour views will result in increased coding efficiency and better 3D picture quality. 

Sharpness Correction: Modifying the sharpness/focus of multiview video sets to be consistent across all cameras. We will investigate segmenting frames into objects of different depth, so that different correction parameters can be applied at different depth levels.  

Time Varying Correction:  For long multiview sequences, conditions may change over time.  Multiview video may be captured with moving cameras, which will require different correction parameters over time.  A major challenge will be to maintain consistency between views and between successive frames within each view.

Real Time Correction:  Developing correcting multiview algorithms for video that is being captured and broadcast in real time.  

The proposed research falls in newly emerging multimedia and entertainment sectors, which are among the most dynamic and fastest growing industry sectors in the Canadian economy.

"Future Broadband Wireless Cellular-based Access Systems (BWCASs) such as High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), UMTS Long Term Evolution (LTE) and the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), pose a myriad of new opportunities for leveraging the support of a wide range of ""content rich"" mobile multimedia services (e.g., video conferencing, audio and video streaming, broadcast TV and online gaming) with diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This is due to the remarkably high bandwidth that is supported by these systems, which was previously only available to wireline connections. Despite the support for such high bandwidth, satisfying the diverse QoS of users while maximizing the revenues of network operators is still one of the major issues in these systems. Without efficient resource management, network operators may not be able to meet the increasing demand of users for multimedia services, and hence they may suffer great revenue loss.  The objective of this research is to distinguish and devise effective resource management techniques for BWCAS networks. To this end, I will consider designing and developing efficient bandwidth management frameworks, which aim at supporting multiple classes of traffic with different users having different QoS requirements, supporting inter- and intra-class fairness, preventing network congestion and maximizing the network operator's revenues. Moreover, I will propose architectures for guaranteeing end-to-end QoS, and evaluate alternative technological or methodological approaches for delivering services with QoS guarantees. I shall also devise congestion pricing solutions for BWCASs, which includes defining and deriving pricing functions that consider the QoS of different wireless services in addition to the current load in the network. The research findings of this project represent a definite step towards meeting the ""anywhere, anytime and any form"" communication concept. More importantly, the findings will benefit the Canadian telecommunications industry and business with means to plan, implement and deploy BWCAS networks in a manner that is both time- and cost-efficient.","Communications technologies (satellites, radar, etc.)","University of Guelph",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","R�seaux de t�l�communications","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"

"The acquisition of freezing tolerance is key to the survival of many plants in temperate regions. Investigations into the molecular basis for this tolerance, mostly in the model plant Arabidopsis, have discovered that the CBF pathway is important for this process: Activation of this pathway by low, non-freezing temperatures is sufficient to increase freezing tolerance. Plants contain more than one CBF gene but it is not known which is required to protect tissues that are essential for survival. 



Our lab addresses this question using grapevines as a model. Winter hardiness in these plants depends in large part on freezing tolerance of buds and canes, tissue types that are absent from Arabisopsis. Our approach is to compare the freezing tolerant wild grape, Vitis riparia, with the freezing sensitive wine grape, Vitis vinifera. We identified and analyzed 4 different grape CBF genes and want to determine now which differences in the CBF pathways of the two grape species results in differences in freezing tolerance. 



It is anticipated that the results of this research will have far-reaching practical applications. The Ontario wine industry contributed $245 million in 2006 to the Ontario government revenue. However, the continuing success of this Industry is challenged by severe winters, which caused yield losses of about 50% in 2005. An increased understanding of the CBF pathway in grapes would provide the information necessary to guide a balanced approach to the production of winegrape cultivars with increased abiotic stress tolerance. The same approach could be applied to other woody perennials such as peach and plum.

"Recent worldwide urgency regarding high oil prices and climate change has been driven by depleting oil reserves and global warming, due to carbon dioxide emissions. Society's dependence on petroleum is unsustainable, both environmentally and economically. It threatens geopolitical stability and for many countries, it is a most serious issue of national security. In this country, Canadians wish to pass a clean environment to the next generations. They look forward to technological innovation that can mitigate climate change, smog, acid rain and pollution. At the workplace, they wish to stay competitive in industries vulnerable to high oil prices, such as the manufacturing, automotive and aerospace sectors. Unlike hydrocarbons, hydrogen is a sustainable and clean energy carrier. It is widely believed to be the world's next-generation fuel. Ontario has already begun to move towards a hydrogen-fueled economy. For example, the HyLYZER refueling station at Exhibition Place in Toronto is part of Toronto's Hydrogen Village. The station produces about 65 kg of hydrogen per day using wind energy, which can supply hydrogen for about 20 vehicles. Unfortunately, wind power is incapable of producing consistent large-scale capacities of hydrogen needed for a worldwide Hydrogen Economy. Furthermore, as a carbon-based technology that emits greenhouse gases, the predominant existing process (steam-methane reforming; SMR) is also unsuitable. A highly promising alternative without greenhouse gas emissions uses nuclear heat for thermochemical decomposition of water.

"The driving force behind my program of research lies in the development of statistical methods for modeling and inference with spatial and spatiotemporal data. These methods are applied with strong impact to answering scientific questions arising in both forestry and spatial epidemiology. In the forest ecology setting, spatiotemporal data arise in studies of recurrent tree infection where it is of interest to describe the

complex dynamics of disease as well its interaction with other processes such as wildfire. Understanding these dynamics can help mitigate the severe economic and environmental impact of such disease. In spatial epidemiology, it is of substantial interest to characterize variation in disease risk, both geographically and over

time in disease mapping studies. Here, statistical methods are developed with focus on modeling latent risk patterns and characterizing residual heterogeneity which can give clues on disease etiology and aid in generating related hypotheses.



The application areas generate challenging problems for statistical modeling, computing and inference. From a modeling perspective, there is a need to accommodate non-Gaussian, censored data with models allowing for flexible parametric or semiparametric dependence structure including spatial, temporal and more general multivariate correlation. From a computing perspective, there is a need to develop algorithms and approximate methods to handle the large spatial datasets that arise commonly in forestry and ecology. The research proposed here will tackle these problems with specific focus on the development of (I) methods for statistical modeling with large point-referenced spatial datasets and (II) flexible and robust models for disease mapping based on a new framework for Bayesian area-to-point kriging.

"The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand the impact of IT on the structure of supply chains throughout the economy. The underlying driver of this impact is information sharing between supply chain members. The proposal is divided into four phases. 



Phase 1studies upstream IT spillovers. Because much of information sharing is upstream from customer to supplier, we examine the effects of systems for information sharing upstream. Phase 2 studies direct vs market linkages. Upstream information sharing results both from dedicated systems, and through market conditions affecting partners in the supply chain. Phase 3 studies information sharing and outsourcing of production. We examine if IT increases the outsourcing of production. Phase 4 studies information sharing and supply chain systems. We examine whether IT has changed the structure of the system of supply chains whereby given industries are now share supply chains with different industries than they did before.

"Nano-science is an explosively developing modern area of research dealing with nanometer-scale objects and phenomena which possess unusual characteristics originating from their quantum nature. Harnessing the hidden opportunities of the nano-world will and already does open new and very broad avenues of progress for modern technology and society. These include the creation of new materials with unique and tailored physical and chemical properties, molecular electronics (using molecules as wires and devices), and many others. The proposed research is aimed to make a contribution to this important activity.

   A central concept of Nano-science is clusters (aggregates of a few to a few hundreds of atoms or molecules), whose properties can be very different from those of their constituent units and of the bulk material, and significantly vary with the cluster size, shape, and composition. Materials assembled from clusters can inherit their unique characteristics, while clusters are of interest by themselves and can have independent applications.

   The planned research will focus on a novel class of nano-objects represented by cluster cages encapsulating a hard or soft core, such as a molecule or a smaller cluster. The cages will include those of metal atoms and water molecules, and the cores will evolve from a single small molecule (hydrogen, carbon, hydrocarbon) to a polyatomic system (a larger molecule, several small ones and up to a ""nano-droplet""). Molecular-radical cores forming bonds with their metal cages can lead to hard composite-particles, while more inert fillers or water cages can result in mechanically soft systems such as ""nano-balloons"" or ""nano-cushions"".

   Properties of such systems are expected to be discovered to be unique and sensitive to the amount and nature of the filling species as well as to the size and composition of the surrounding ""nano-capsule"". A systematic investigation of various structure-property relationships is the goal of this project. Potential applications of such nano-objects include fluid (e.g. hydrogen) storage, drug-delivery nano-vessels, and tunable catalysts. Hydrocarbon clusters inside water cages also represent alternative fuel sources found on Earth in huge deposits.

   The above research program will be carried out via large-scale calculations with the high-quality electronic-structure methods. For this purpose, state-of-the-art professional codes will be employed by means of extensive computing facilities.

"During gametogenesis the genome undergoes massive epigenetic remodeling. The profiles of DNA methylation change and become different in sperm and oocytes.  Furthermore, in the male germ cells, histones are removed and DNA is packaged by protamines.  Some of these epigenetic marks that are imposed differently during female and male gametogenesis are reversed after fertilization, however a group of chromosomal regions conserve the gametic epigenetic marks throughout life.  These marks, or genomic imprints, are maintained in somatic cells of the embryo and adult and are involved in the regulation of imprinted genes.  Therefore, genomic imprinting is a unique mechanism of gene regulation where the silencing or activation of a given imprinted gene allele is determined before the embryo is conceived. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism of imprint resetting in the mammalian germ line.","Not available","McGill University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Biologie mol�culaire","Biologie mol�culaire"
"The Aquarius Project is a major computational initiative designed to investigate the clustering of cold dark matter (CDM) on the smallest scales relevant to the formation of galaxies. CDM is believed to be the dominant form of matter in the Universe, and it has become in the past few years the paradigm of structure formation in the Universe. Together with ""dark energy"" (which governs today the universal expansion on the largest scales) dark matter is one of the premier contemporary puzzles in our understanding of the natural world.  An empirical understanding of the way CDM clusters on very small scales---the main goal of Aquarius---would help to constrain the nature of the dark matter and has had major impact on fields as diverse as Galactic Astronomy, Cosmology, and Particle Astrophysics. In particular, Aquarius will greatly advance strategies: (i) for exploring the formation of our Galaxy; (ii) for searching for signals from dark matter annihilation; and (iii) for designing experiments for direct detection of dark matter. These provide important diagnostics and tests that will serve to validate the CDM paradigm. The Aquarius project has used some of the largest academic supercomputers in the world, including STELLA,an IBM-BlueGene supercomputer sited at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, and the HLRB-II Altix supercomputer at the Leibniz Supercomputer Center in Munich, Germany. Through competitive bidding, we were awarded a total of more than 10-million CPU hours at those centers. The simulations have so far produced more than 100Tb of data which are being analyzed by various collaborators across the world. We request a computer system to store, analyze, and visualize parts of the Aquarius dataset at the University of Victoria.

"The completion of photometric and redshift surveys of large portions of the sky have revolutionized our understanding of faint galaxies, extending the category of dwarf galaxies to luminosities so faint that they blur the traditional distinction between galaxies and star clusters. At the same time, advances in computational cosmology have led to improved predictions of the properties of the smallest dark matter halos able to harbour luminous galaxies in the current paradigm of structure formation, the LCDM model. The confrontation of data with model predictions on these small objects holds the promise to validate or challenge the established paradigm on scales beyond those used to constrain its main parameters. The time is ripe for a concerted effort designed to assess the cosmological significance of Nature's smallest extragalactic objects. I propose to study this topic using a variety of observational and theoretical tools, from detailed N-body simulation of the formation of dark matter halos, to gasdynamical simulation of the formation of luminous dwarf galaxies, to direct observational efforts designed to survey the faintest galaxies in our Local Universe and to understand their impact on the formation of our Milky Way galaxy.

"Fault-tolerant computing plays an important role in today's world. There is a large dependency on computer systems in our everyday life. We depend on these systems for banking, e-commerce, communications, travel, etc. Fault tolerance prevents system failures and is intended to ensure that the system delivers the required service in spite of faults and errors. In the past two decades, we have seen the evolution of computer networks as a merger of the communication and computing worlds. This revolution has made the dream of global connectivity possible and has opened the door for numerous applications/tasks requiring the use of large computing facilities. For example, computational grids have become increasingly important to solve computationally intensive and time consuming problems in science and engineering. Since the failure probability increases with a rising number of components, fault tolerance is an essential characteristic of such

massively parallel systems. The rapid growth of the Internet to achieve global connectivity has increased the importance of fault tolerance and related techniques such as self-repair to ensure constant mode of operation and securing data centers. The emergence of wireless sensor networks for real-time monitoring of critical infrastructure that might be subjected to natural and/or human-induced hazards has also increased the need for fault tolerance. Although there has been a lot of work done in developing fault-tolerant techniques, more work is required on how to incorporate these techniques in practical applications/areas. This project will focus on fault tolerance aspects in various computing systems, communication infrastructures, and applications. The project will cover characterization of faults, system diagnosis, testing, and development of fault-tolerant application protocols for communications, routing, data management, etc. The project will use the characterization of faults and evolutionary methods to study reconfigurability problem and develop efficient, cost-effective, and scalable solutions. The outcome of the research will have a significant impact on making our computing and communication infrastructure more reliable, robust, and secure.","Information, computer and communication technologies","University of Ottawa",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Technologie de l'information","Technologie de l'information"

"My research program is centred on a laboratory for experimental astrophysics. The primary goal of this laboratory is the development and use of sensitive far-infrared and submillimetre spectrometers and radiometers in a range of astronomical projects. Building on a long-standing research program in Fourier transform spectroscopy at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and, more recently, the development of an Infrared Radiometer for Millimetre Astronomy (IRMA), my group has assumed key roles in two major projects: Herschel/SPIRE and SCUBA-2, and, building on this success is actively championing a Canadian role in an exciting new initiative being considered by the Japanese and European Space agencies called SPICA. 



These projects combine recent advances in array detector technology with Fourier spectrometers to provide a unique spectral imaging capability at submillimetre wavelengths. The imaging spectrometers have a wide range of application from the study of star and planet formation to galactic evolution and the early universe. My primary astronomical interests lie in applying this technology to the study of the physics of the interstellar medium as it pertains to star formation.

"Computer simulation has become a fundamental tool used by mechanical engineers and architects for the design of energy efficient buildings. The proposed research focuses on improving the modeling of convective heat transfer in whole-building energy analysis software. Convection is the primary mode of heat exchange between the exterior walls of a building and the indoor room air. Thus, the ability to accurately predict the convective heat transfer on the indoor surfaces (walls, windows, doors etc.) is crucial for accurate simulation.

     In the proposed research, heat transfer studies will be conducted for several configurations of importance to building energy simulation. These will include: (i) convection on walls above baseboard heaters, (ii) convection on walls adjacent to standard heating and cooling vents/diffusers, and (iii) convection on window surfaces and domed skylights. The results will be summarized in simplified ""correlations"" that are suitable for inclusion in whole-building thermal analysis software. As a parallel activity, research will also be conducted on new methods to measure turbulent convective heat transfer, using a laser interferometer in conjunction with a high-speed digital camera. 

     Improvements in the capability to predict the thermal performance of buildings will lead to improvements in energy conservation, which has both economic and environmental benefits. Lower fossil fuel consumption will reduce air pollution and contribute the Canada's national objectives for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. 

     The proposed work will be undertaken as a well-integrated program, involving a balance between experimentation and state-of-the-art computer modeling. This research will provide significant training experiences for PhD, Master's and undergraduate students, and will lead to important advances in the field of heat transfer.     )

"Transportation is currently reliant almost exclusively on fossil fuels. However, hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) are starting to make a significant impact on the auto sector. Recent figures show they successfully reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Even better are PHEV's (plug-in HEV's) that can be charged directly from the grid. If suitable batteries were available, PHEVs may well capture much of the hybrid market in the near future. This project is directed to the development of new electrode materials for the energy storage devices that can fulfill the demands for these applications. Lithium ion batteries are the rechargeable cell of choice, so powerful that they've become ubiquitous in today's world. They are more energy-dense than the nickel metal hydride cells currently used in HEV's. That means a Li-ion battery can run for a longer time than a nickel metal hydride battery of the same weight, and PHEV becomes a reality. The aim is to develop much safer cathode materials to replace those that are currently commercial in portable electronic devices, to produce batteries that have the low cost and longevity characteristics suitable for commercialization for HEV/PHEV. The materials of choice that fulfill these needs are lithium metal phosphates (LMPs). These are now seen as viable alternatives although their poor electronic conductivity properties pose practical challenges. This is the focus of this proposal. The project, in conjunction with our industrial partner, GM, will encompass different aspects of LMP chemistry, including the a) development of better coatings to increase the overall conductivity; b) understanding of phase transitions in the materials during electrochemical reactions; c) interface studies to probe the interaction between the coating and the LMP surface; d) determination of the role that solid solutions play in increasing transport properties, and finding ways to induce this behavior in materials; e) understanding ion and electron transport in a new iron fluorophosphate that we have recently developed.","Energy storage and conversion","University of Waterloo",2,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Structure, propri�t�s et essais des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"

"The ribosome represents a cell's ""factory"" for making protein and, as such, is an indispensable cellular substructure.  A better understanding of this ""factory"", its function and how it is synthesized is not only of fundamental interest but has many potential applications ranging from biotechnology to medical research.  Our research is focused on ribosomal RNA which makes up half the ribosome mass and has been demonstrated to represent the active ""machinery"" in protein synthesis.  We propose to ask further questions about the way the ribosomal RNA is synthesized and assembled into ribosomes as well as how ""quality control"" is applied to avoid non functional ribosomes that can be very detrimental or even lethal to the cell.  Past studies indicate that interactions between the spacer regions in rRNA transcripts are critical to the efficient processing of rRNA as well as ribosome maturation.  We have developed a model in which rRNA processing represents a mechanism for quality control during ribosome biogenesis, where the interactions between different regions of the rRNA transcripts help assure that only functional RNAs are incorporated into mature ribosomes.  We also have identified a protein complex, a ribosome assembly chaperone (RAC) which interacts with the spacer regions to organize the appropriate processing domain.  With further funding we propose to continue our characterization of the RAC protein complex, its sites of interaction within the spacer regions and how it acts to facilitate ribosome biogenesis.  Nucleotide modifications also will be examined as a second quality control mechanism and studies will continue on regulatory mechanisms that control ribosome biogenesis.  Given the ribosome's central role in cell function and growth, such studies might easily be expected to contribute to human health or agriculture.  Many drugs and pesticides, for example, have and will continue to target ribosomes or ribosome synthesis.  Graduate students will continue to participate in all aspects of this research in order to provide maximum levels of training

"The use of neotissue scaffolds for the delivery and transplantation of cells to regenerate diseased or missing connective tissues is an attractive approach to improving tissue engineering and health. Compression of hyper-hydrated gels has recently been reported as a ground-breaking rapid fabrication method to accurately make three-dimensional, fibrillar collagen scaffolds having well-defined architectures and increased strength for tissue engineering. With or without cells, these represent a major shift from previous approaches in that they provide scaffolding based on the biology of extracellular matrices found in connective tissues. Strong, biopolymer-based materials reflecting physiologic tissue structure can be fabricated by compression within minutes (rather than in days or weeks) and can produce readily implantable neotissues. Compression fabrication can be applied to other hyper-hydrated gels (>95% fluid hydrogels) as a widely applicable technology by recognising that fluids are typically not a key component of the structure of reconstituted, hyper-hydrated gels; thus, its removal by compression can greatly improve the properties of implantable scaffolds.

Collagen-chitosan mixtures are inherently biocompatible materials. It is anticipated that by varying the composition of protein to polysaccharide, it will be possible to control bioactivity and biodegradability as well as mechanical and ultra-structural properties. By applying the compression technique to the collagen-chitosan mixtures, a further level of control can be exerted over the matrix-to-fluid composition of the neotissue scaffolds. Compression of these hybrid scaffolds will also provide control over neotissue structure in a manner which will directly affect cell behaviour, and allow it adaptation for enhanced behaviour of environment-dependent cells.

"Tissue engineering, with its aim of restoring function through delivery of living elements and integration in the living tissues has, in the last decade, emerged as a viable alternative method in the repair of tissues.  Conventionally, this has relied on the ability of cultured cells to fabricate new tissue around a scaffold. This is carried out by either the deposition of extracellular matrix (e.g. collagen) onto degradable synthetic materials, or the remodelling of native matrices, in three dimensional (3D) culture such as tissue bioreactors. This process has so far been slow and unpredictable due to a limited understanding of how cells work. What is known, however, is that the initial scaffold composition and structure is critical to cell behaviour.

Recently, an alternative, cell-independent, approach of producing biomimetic scaffolds was reported. This involves the rapid removal of fluid from hyper-hydrated collagen gels by using unconfined plastic compression (PC). PC fabrication has been shown to make, in minutes rather than in days or weeks, tailored 3D, native fibrillar collagen scaffolds with defined nano-to-micro-scale structure, and predictable mechanical properties while maintaining greater than 90% cell viability. Key to this is the management of the fluid component through the application of mechanical load.  It is therefore an ideal mechanism for controlling collagen matrix and cell density for a particular target tissue application since collagen constitutes approximately 30 % of all musculoskeletal tissues in mammals.  For example, depending on the extent of loading, the initial collagen concentration can range from 10-25 weight % i.e. approaching levels found in tissue. The findings will also be extended to other protein-based materials e.g. fibrin and fibronectin, thereby opening the possibilities of producing multi-phased materials of semi-interpenetrating networks. By incorporating porogens, these biomaterials could also find applications in drug delivery systems.","Biomedical engineering","McGill University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Biomat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"

It is hoped that this information will increase our understanding of the biological mechanisms responsible for oxygen and blood delivery to the brain and muscle.

"In most areas of scientific research, there are laws and principles that are the foundation of research and theory within that domain. In the study of human memory, however, there are few principles and no laws. One reason offered for the lack of laws and principles is that memory is not a unitary system but rather, is a set of different memory systems, each of which operates according to different rules. Because of this, discovering general laws or principles of memory is not possible. My research examines this issue by questioning whether there really is sufficient evidence to justify dividing memory into 5 separate systems. The research programme focuses on the distinction between short-term memory (also known as working memory) and long-term memory and has four major components. (1) Retrieving an item from memory begins, in almost all situations, with a cue. By cue, researchers mean a specific prompt or query, such as ""Where did I leave my car keys?"" or ""Who was that actor in 'Ben-Hur'?"" One reason for distinguishing between short- and long-term memory is that retrieval from short-term memory does not require a cue. The research re-examines this issue by looking for effects of varying the retrieval cue for items thought to be stored in short-term memory. (2) One common cause of forgetting is interference: when trying to remember your new telephone number, you retrieve your previous number instead. A second reason for distinguishing between short- and long-term memory is that short-term memory is immune from this sort of interference. The research will test whether this is really the case. (3) Researchers have identified several 'signature' results that indicate that a person is utilizing short-term memory on a particular task. The third series of studies looks to see if these benchmark effects can be found in situations in which short-term memory is not playing a role. (4) The final component is the development of a mathematical model of memory that does not distinguish between memory systems. This is part of a larger research programme which assumes that there are general laws and principles and focuses on formulating and testing potential principles. It will also keep Canadian-based research at the forefront of this critical area.

"Altruism - the capacity to perform acts costly to self but beneficial to others, is central to the evolution of various biological phenomena from social behavior to evolutionary transitions in individuality. Although the selective conditions favoring altruism are being increasingly understood, the evolutionary origins of the genetic basis for this behavior remain elusive. The most extreme forms of altruism are reproductive altruism and suicide.  In multicellular organisms, they are typified by the differentiation of sterile somatic cells during development and the launch of the cell suicide program in damaged or mutated cells.  The goal of this research program is to investigate the genetic basis for the evolution of reproductive altruism (i.e., soma) and cell suicide (programmed cell death, PCD) during the transition to multicellularity.  Our general hypothesis is that the evolution of altruism involved the co-option of genes and modification of regulatory circuits implicated in the response to changing/stressful environments. The finding that the evolution of altruism during the evolution of multicellularity involved the co-option of a regulatory pathway conditioned on environmental cues will (i) complement and provide support to recent proposals that cast differentiation and social evolution involved the remodeling of regulatory circuits associated with the perception/processing of environmental stimuli by solitary organisms, and (ii) argue that general principles underlying the evolution of altruism at the molecular level can be identified.  In addition, information on the evolution of PCD will facilitate our understanding of signaling pathways regulating PCD and cell proliferation and can improve our ability to predict the consequences of perturbations in these pathways in complex multicellular organisms, including humans.

Many problems in engineering and science are modeled with systems containing both differential and algebraic equations, also called differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Systems of DAEs arise for example in robotics, circuit simulation, optimal control, and multi-body dynamics. A DAE is characterized by its index, which measures how difficult it is solve the DAE numerically. The higher the index, the more difficult the solution process is. Standard numerical methods for  DAEs usually handle only one form or class of DAEs and are typically restricted to at most index-3 problems. 

    N. Nedialkov has developed numerical algorithms and a C++ software package, DAETS, Differential-Algebraic Equations by Taylor Series, that can solve arbitrary index, any order, and fully implicit systems of DAEs. This package has proved accurate and robust on numerous problems.

   The goal of the proposed research is to advance further the present theory for solving high-index DAEs and add new algorithms to the DAETS solver. We shall work on developing algorithms for solving hybrid DAEs that combine both continuous and discrete behavior. Such problems arise in modeling hybrid dynamic systems, which are ubiquitous in engineering. We shall extend DAETS with more robust, defect-based error control, and improve its performance by handling sparsity and using more efficient automatic differentiation techniques. We shall extend the current theory to include integrals in problem formulation, which would result in methods that can handle systems containing differential, algebraic and integral equations. Finally, we shall develop methods for efficient solution of stiff DAEs and interval techniques for computing rigorous bounds on the solution of a DAE. 

    In addition to advancing the existing theory, at the end of this project, we should have a comprehensive, industrial-strength DAE package.

"Application of MIMO antenna systems in future wireless networks is inevitable. Using MIMO systems in wireless networks brings many benefits including improvement of the network reliability, security, data throughput and capacity. However, there are some issues such as cost, complexity and physical size which have prohibited their widespread commercial applications. The proposed three year project oversees the development of a novel millimeter-wave MIMO antenna systems tailored to the needs of emerging commercial wireless communications using multi-antenna systems. This theoretical and experimental research will allow our collaboration team from LRTCS-UQAT, INRS-EMT and UQO  long with our industrial partner T�l�bec, to lead Canadian and worldwide efforts in developing cost-effective, high-performance solutions for the emerging MIMO wireless communication market in underground mines. Specifically, our research effort is directed toward developing and implementing new designs of millimeter-wave antenna arrays for mobile terminals and then their applications to implement experimental MIMO systems with low cost and compact size. Our approach is based on new class of wideband millimetre-wave  planar antenna arrays. With this approach, an experimental MIMO antenna system will be implemented using microstrip or CPW technology, which allows integration of the antenna array and the MIMO transceiver on the same board. Therefore our research effort will be directed as follows: (i) Accurate and general millimeter-wave techniques will be developed for the design of  planar antennas; (ii) Planar antenna arrays will be designed, fabricated and tested; (iii) Simple and practical MIMO channel models will be developed for investigating the performances of wireless communications using MIMO antenna systems; Experimental MIMO system will be designed, fabricated and implemented. Finally, the new knowledge generated from this project and the training of highly qualified personnel associated to the different stages of this work will certainly contribute to enhance Canada's global competitiveness in high-technology sectors.

"The proposed work is focused on two of the first order tectonic boundaries found on the Earth's surface: Mid-ocean ridges and their flanks, and passive continental margins. The mid-ocean ridges are a divergent plate tectonic boundary where new oceanic crust is being continuously generated. They make up the most extensive mountain system and the longest chain of volcanoes in the world. The thin crust and relatively simple tectonic setting of mid-ocean ridges make them ideal settings to investigate the magma plumbing system of an active volcano. How oceanic crust evolves along the mid-ocean ridge flanks is important from the perspectives of both basic science (e.g., energy and mass exchange between the Earth's solid interior and the oceans) and subduction earthquake hazards as they may be influenced by the plate hydration processes. Passive continental margins located at the boundary between old, thick continental crust and young, thin oceanic crust are one of the Earth's major transitions. They are formed when continental lithosphere is rifted apart to form new ocean basins. The continent-ocean boundary is also the site of major sedimentary basins created during subsidence of the thinned continental crust and the newly formed oceanic crust. These marginal basins are potentially of great economic importance because they can host large hydrocarbon reservoirs. All of the investigations proposed here rely on using multichannel seismic (MCS) data. MCS data are analyzed to form reflection images, determine physical properties of the imaged structures, and construct velocity profiles by applying shallow seismic tomography. Wide-angle refraction data will also be used for the study of passive margins to independently form deep velocity models, and in combination with the MCS data to extract maximum possible information about the targeted structures. The key goals of the proposed program are to: 1) Investigate mid-ocean ridge processes at unprecedented detail by producing the first 3D prestack time and depth migrated images of a mid-ocean ridge environment; 2) Characterize large variations in the ocean-continent transitions that appear to occur over small margin-lateral distances within just one rift segment.

"Understanding our world's biodiversity is a fundamental objective of biology. One principle component to this understanding is the role that genes play in shaping phenotypic diversity - to understand biodiversity we must understand the genetic basis of behavioural, physiological and morphological variation. Such knowledge is important not only for pure discovery, but also for the effective management of our natural resources. The proposed research will integrate multiple expertise and research platforms from molecular and behavioural ecology to address four major areas of research comprising mating systems, recognition systems, endocrinology and neurophysiology, and functional genomics. We will use three fish species (bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, and guppy Poecilia reticulata) from three orders to provide a comprehensive understanding of phenotypic diversity from molecules to organisms living in their natural environment. Specifically, we will: (1) characterize the roles of natural and sexual selection in shaping genetic diversity in immune genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC); (2) detail the mechanisms and genetic architecture of how individuals recognize their kin, including the role of the MHC as 'recognition alleles'; (3) uncover the roles of steroid hormones and receptors in the behaviour of individuals that adopt different mating tactics and life histories; and (4) implement microarray and real-time PCR technology to profile gene expression patterns associated with the behavioural variation. Two of the fishes we study are socially and economically important in Canada, and thus the research will have both pure (discovery) and applied (conservation) applications. My lab is dedicated to training highly qualified personnel and generating publications of the highest quality. The proposed work will involve 6 PhD students, 4 MSc students, 5 undergraduate thesis students, 1 research technician, and undergraduate assistants. These students will receive extensive training in all aspects of research within molecular and behavioural ecology, which will make them highly qualified and demanded personnel capable of entering academic, government and private sectors.

"The emerging field of assistive technologies requires an interdisciplinary effort to tackle the increasing demand to use intelligent robots and/or devices to assist humans in critical applications including search and rescue, elderly/hospital care, military combat, and surveillance/exploration. This work directly addresses this demand by developing intelligent systems to assist in dangerous and stressful tasks for humans and/or when a shortage of qualified persons exists. As these systems enter the aforementioned real world scenarios, their performance in accomplishing complex tasks or solving problems is highly dependent on their perception and understanding of these often times unknown or cluttered environments. Hence, major advances are needed in sensor techniques, sensor information interpretation and control architectures to allow these systems to explore and interact in varying 3D environments and in environments which can potentially contain humans. 



The goal of the proposed research program is to develop novel methodologies to guide the effective design of assistive systems for everyday applications. The proposed research program will focus on the development of intelligent perception methodologies utilizing imagery techniques.  In particular, my group will develop knowledge-based intelligence for assistive systems working in unknown environments with applications to emerging areas in robotics/devices in need of such intelligence.

"The proposed research will investigate the areas of the human brain that process both sensory and movement information related to the hand.  The areas of interest include the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex and the medial superior parietal lobule. The goals are to understand how each of these cortical areas represent sensory input, and how their representations change when input becomes important to the task, or dictates an upcoming movement of the hand. The goals will be accomplished using two non-invasive techniques that provide complimentary information, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).  For each area of interest, fMRI will be used to identify which digits occupy the most cortical territory, how intense responses are to specific types of sensory input, and if responses increase or decrease depending on how relevant the input is to the task, or movement.  Using TMS, the interaction between each area of interest and the primary motor cortex, the largest contributor to the spinal path responsible for hand movements, will be probed.  Each of the cortical areas of interest have direct projections with the primary motor cortex yet there are uncertainties about when the sensory area conveys its information to the primary motor cortex, and how this information is conveyed.  For example, will the sensory projection reduce responses in primary motor cortex, or will it increase responses?  Understanding the neural mechanisms that underpin sensory-guided hand movements is essential to developing therapies that aim to improve hand function in patients such as those have suffered stroke or with movement disorders such as dystonia. The proposed research program will investigate the cortical mechanisms of sensory-motor hand movement in healthy populations, a precursor to developing methods to assist clinical populations.

"I request funding support for three projects which involve measurement of the stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios and radiocarbon dating of natural samples from Arctic areas. 

1) The first project is to investigate the possibility of radiocarbon dating snow goose bones from archaeological sites in the Canadian Arctic. Radiocarbon dating in the Arctic has been very difficult for various technical reasons, and it is hoped that this work will provide a new, more reliable means. As well, stable isotopic measurements of the goose bones as well as of musk-ox bones from the same sites will provide information on the adaptations of these animals. 

2) The second project involves similar isotopic measurement of samples of marine mammal bones (primarily seal) from archaeological sites in Greenland and Canada. The isotopic constituents of marine mammals reflect the complexity of the Arctic oceans in which they live. This project is to obtain further data on these past animals and to use that data to better understand their ecological niches and perhaps gain information on Arctic oceanic processes. 

3) The third project is to continue studies of a newly-observed phenomenon. Here, we have seen that the stable nitrogen isotopic ratios of modern plants growing  on archaeological sites can reflect the human activity which took place there in antiquity. Even though the processes underlying this observation are not yet well understood, it already has shown great promise as a new tool for non-destructive archaeological investigation, and it will likely find use in other fields as well. This project is to continue investigations into the nature of this new tool.","Advancement of knowledge","Simon Fraser University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�ochimie et g�ochronologie","G�ochimie et g�ochronologie"

"The fifth edition of my book ""Fishes of the world"", 2012, will present the latest in systematic treatment of all higher-level fish groups, both fossil and living. The detailed classification showing genealogical relationships of various groups will be useful to biologists requiring a modern classification of fishes showing their biodiversity, e.g., those who seek to understand the evolutionary origin of any feature, whether it be e. g., a skeletal, life history, physiological, or behavioral trait. Currently, there is much new information on extant (with morphological and molecular based phylogenies) and fossil material and there is a very high rate of new information, making a revision for 2012 for this widely used book very timely. This critical synthesis is also important in training highly qualified personnel because the classification (with its many references to uncertainties and alternate proposals) used in past editions of this book are used, either directly or indirectly from other sources using my classification, by teachers of courses in ichthyology or fish biology.

    )	I Chair a committee documenting the fishes in North America, presenting the recommended scientific name and the correct common name (English and Spanish for Mexico; English and French for Quebec), along with notes on changes or uncertainties. Such basic work, with the most recent edition published in 2004, is fundamental for fish researchers, as well as for publications on management and conservation work. The revision of this material to be published in 2010 will deal with the many new species being described and will also give the common name in French for all species in Canada. Amongst other systematic studies, I and a former graduate student are describing new species of fathead sculpins, In addition, we have the long-term objective of working on the evolutionary relationships of this family. I am also working on a relatively unique phenomenon in brook sticklebacks. In over 40 localities in a high percent of the individuals lack the pelvic skeleton, a loss with a genetic basis.

"Stars are considered to be the most fundamental (macroscopic) building blocks of the universe. It is our understanding of their overall properties and evolution that allows us to deduce the age, scale, and structure of the Universe. Stellar observations can be used to probe the behaviour of matter under extreme conditions and to test the predictions derived from fundamental physical theories such as general relativity and quantum mechanics.

  

The proposed research falls within the general realm of stellar astrophysics and is primarily concerned with the evolution of and physical phenomena associated with compact binaries containing white dwarfs, neutron stars/pulsars and black holes. Important questions that will be addressed include: (1) How can we reliably determine the ages and other properties of pulsars in binary systems?  (2) What are the progenitors of Type Ia Supernovae (important for determining the structure of the Universe) and which evolutionary pathways can re ruled out?  (3) What is the nature of the Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources that have been observed in distant galaxies? Could they be binaries composed of black holes having masses in excess of 1000 solar masses? 



The other major thrust of the proposed research focuses on the theoretical evolution and observational analysis of the population of low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and planetary mass objects that can be found in the solar neighbourhood and in nearby globular clusters. Since these objects are so intrinsically faint, we will try to determine the fraction of mass that they contribute in various locations in our Galaxy. This is an especially exciting part of the astronomical research given their close relationship to the recently discovered extrasolar planets.","Space and astronomy","Bishop's University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Stellaire,"Astronomie et astrophysique"

"Examples of rapid evolution in nature reveal that evolutionary dynamics occur over ecologically-relevant time-scales. The feedback between evolutionary (e.g., selection & recombination) and ecological (e.g., competition & predation) processes is predicted to strongly influence biological dynamics, and recent experiments demonstrate that it can generate unique dynamics in the laboratory. Most research, however, does not consider the phenotypic plasticity in life-history that characterizes almost all organisms in nature. Using a freshwater predator-prey system, my research demonstrates that life-history plasticity generates contrasting types of predator-prey cycles. These cycles cause different rates of selection among predator genotypes, but in the opposite direction predicted by theory. As a result, our work suggests that the feedback may operate differently in organisms with strong phenotypic plasticity. Over the next five years, I will use freshwater zooplankton to study the influence of eco-evolutionary feedbacks on biological dynamics. My research combines experimental evolution and ecology with mathematical modeling, and uses both lab-based microcosm and field-based mesocosm experiments. To decompose the feedback into a series of testable hypotheses, experiments will use: 1) single genotype populations, which study the interaction between population dynamics and genotype-specific energy-budgets; 2) multiple genotype populations with asexual reproduction, which test how the feedback operates in different food webs; and 3) multiple genotype populations with sexual reproduction, which test the impact of recombination on community dynamics and genetic diversity. These projects will form the basis of 3 M.Sc. theses, 2 Ph.D. theses, and 6 undergraduate theses. Core to my research program is modeling, which makes it possible to isolate the mechanisms responsible for dynamics, and generate testable predictions at each stage of the feedback. Iteration between model development and hypothesis testing will lead to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms responsible for generating and maintaining genetic diversity in nature, and how they influence biological patterns.","Advancement of knowledge","Queen's University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","�volution et �cologie","�volution et �cologie"

"H2S is a highly toxic and corrosive gas present in the natural gas and biogas. Sulphide is also an undesirable component of many wastewaters. Removal of H2S is essential due to its harmful characteristics and for preventing emission of SO2 upon combustion of fuels. Biotreatment of sulphide-laden streams is attractive due to economic advantages, feasibility for treatment of small streams and high efficiency. We have been investigating the potential of Thiomicrospira CVO, a novel sulphide oxidizer isolated from a Canadian oil field, for the removal of sulphide from the liquid streams. CVO is an autotroph which uses sulphide as an electron donor, nitrate as an electron acceptor and CO2 as the sole carbon source. Physiological characteristics of CVO make it suitable for simultaneous removal of sulphide and nitrate from contaminated streams. The first objective of the current proposal is to expand our ongoing research and utilize CVO for the removal of H2S from gaseous streams and generate fundamental knowledge which is crucial for the design and operation of a large scale process. Generation of electricity in microbial fuel cells as a form of renewable energy is gaining momentum. This technology enables direct capture of energy contained in biodegradable compounds, specially in wastewaters, in the form of electricity. To date microbial fuel cells have been used mainly for the treatment of organic wastewaters and only a few studies have dealt with sulphide-containing streams. Moreover, the possibility of simultaneous desulphurization and denitrification in a microbial fuel cell has not been evaluated. The second objective of the current proposal is to study the processes of desulphurization and denitrification in a microbial fuel cell. The basic information generated in our research would significantly increase our understanding of the processes of biodesulphurization and denitrification and the extent of energy which can be extracted from these processes. It will provide us with fundamental information required for the development of an innovative biotechnology for treatment of H2S and nitrate with the possibility of capturing CO2 and electricity generation in fuel cell type bioreactors, the long term objective of our research.",Engineering,"University of Saskatchewan",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie chimique","G�nie chimique"

"Various surveys show that Canadian consumers and businesses have a strong interest in adopting new wireless products to improve their standard of living and increase their productivity. The evolution of wireless access towards data-oriented connections, has led to the coexistence of multiple-access technologies providing new products and services, and exhibiting improved system characteristics (lower power consumption and higher data rates). Over the last seven years, novel architectures like ad hoc and wireless sensor networks have generated new challenges regarding the way radio communication infrastructures must be addressed. Unlike traditional approaches, these architectures require complete self-organization of their nodes as well as support for mobility. The main objective of the proposed research project is to develop efficient and cooperative ad hoc and wireless sensor networks (WSN) based on ultra-wideband (UWB) radio technology to meet the requirements of this new market. The first goal of the research program is to apply UWB with innovative front-end solutions to enhance the system performances in different applications. The second goal is to deploy cooperative algorithms applied to WSN in order to find high efficiency solutions with low complexity implementations for these applications. To achieve these research objectives, the project will be divided into two different directions, which will be investigated in parallel. First, ad hoc UWB wireless sensors will be designed for cooperative localization/tracking in two different indoor environments (in-building and mining). Second, UWB radar sensors will be designed for vehicule collision avoidance applications such as mobile robots and outdoor ground vehicles. The originality of this hardware and algorithmic project consists in combining ad hoc network with wireless sensor devices using a low complexity UWB transceiver front-end in conjunction with novel cooperative algorithms to give application flexibilities, low-cost products and high performance results. Consequently, improved system performance and network cost represent the advantages of the proposed approach compared to the existing ones.

"The ongoing revolution in Astrophysics has been driven by advances in instrumentation, enabling previously impossible observations.  Over the next five years, my group will continue to play its role in this by the exploitation of data recently acquired by instruments developed in my group, and in the development of new experiments.



The Balloon-borne, Large Aperture Sub-mm Telescope (BLAST) is a telescope designed to probe observe inter-stellar dust by its thermal emission.  BLAST made a 12 day flight over Antarctica in December, 2006.  It observed, with sub-arc minute resolution, a large section of the galactic plane, and several extragalactic fields.  Analysis of these data, over the next few years, will make a significant impact on our understanding of the process and history of star formation.



In addition, we will work on the construction and flight of the Spider balloon borne mm-wave telescope, designed to detect the polarization signature of gravitational waves generated in the first moments of the the expansion of the universe.  In this way, we will probe physics at the highest energy scales and earliest times.

The latter field originated historically from quantum mechanics, and has since then maintained close connections to this and other areas of mathematical physics. One of the most recent developments is the theory of operator spaces and quantum groups, which provides an exciting blend of functional analysis, harmonic analysis, algebra and topology, and has applications to quantum information theory and quantum computing. 

The proposal mainly aims at thoroughly investigating the structure of certain natural Banach algebras arising in abstract harmonic analysis, i.e., algebras over locally compact groups, as well as their 'quantized' analogues, defined over quantum groups. The key idea is to follow a representation theoretical approach: the objects of interest can be viewed as completely bounded maps on the algebra of bounded linear operators on a suitable Hilbert space. This enables us to use the powerful machinery of von Neumann algebras and operator spaces. In recent joint work with M. Junge and Z.-J. Ruan, we have thus succeeded, for instance, in characterizing one of the most fundamental concepts of Fourier analysis - Pontryagin duality - in terms of a commutation relation, even in the general context of locally compact quantum groups. Moreover, we have been led to exciting discoveries in quantum information theory, namely the construction of new quantum channels with highly desirable properties (in particular, in the setting of finite-dimensional quantum groups, the completely bounded entropy of these channels can be calculated explicitly). One of the main goals pursued in this line of research is the construction of a certain locally compact group associated with every locally compact quantum group, which is an invariant of the latter, and allows us to transfer ideas from classical harmonic analysis to the realm of quantum groups - a fascinating program that I have just started to develop with one of my Ph.D. students, M. Kalantar.

"William Playfair (1759-1823), considered by many to be the parent of statistical graphics, would likely have been dazzled by modern consumer spreadsheet software. In a single program, one can place thousands of pieces of data, and with a few mouse clicks, compute summary values, and display distributions of data in pie, bar, line, and scatter graphs. Furthermore, a change to a single data point can be propagated immediately through the statistics and to the graphics, letting lay persons easily produce the graphs. But he also might have been surprised at how many of the visualizations were ones he developed in his lifetime, and at the fact that current software generally manipulates relationships between only a few variables at a time. I believe we are at a point in the research frontier where it is possible, in real time, to automatically generate complex conjectures about probabilistic and causal relationships among large numbers of variables from observational data, to visualize such relationships in an intuitive way, to identify weaknesses and strengths in human generated conjectures (where computer-generated conjectures are ambiguous or incomplete), and to use these diagrams effectively to understand the potential consequences of policy changes. The present work draws on and extend results from my previous work, and the work of others, in the areas of artificial intelligence, graphical models, data visualization, information visualization, and computer graphics to produce algorithms and techniques that will give ordinary users of data (i.e, persons who are not trained statisticians) an intuitive visual interface for productively exploring the conjecture space of datasets, interacting as necessary. A proof of concept software implmentation already exists, and preliminary results have already been published.

"Measuring the biodiversity of microbial communities in environments such as soil and sediment has remained a desirable but elusive goal for microbial ecologists due to methodological limitations. Nonetheless, quantifying microbial diversity and identifying its controlling factors remain essential prerequisites to predicting the significance of diversity for ecosystem function and discovering unknown microorganisms of potential use to human society. 



This proposal research has three primary goals. Firstly, high throughput sequencing will be used to identify soil parameters that govern the biodiversity of microbial species associated with arctic tundra, boreal forest, and agricultural soils. The quantitative data generated by this goal will be used to model the structure of these communities, identify the factors that affect this diversity, and determine whether high microbial diversity previously associated with arctic tundra samples is a result of active and cold-adapted microorganisms. Secondly, the research highlighted in this proposal will characterize the organisms responsible for assimilating methane in several geographically disparate environments, including arctic tundra soils, under conditions simulating current and projected environmental conditions. Arctic tundra contains a third of all soil carbon and threatens to release much of this carbon through the effects of climate change, further contributing to increasing global temperatures. Gaining a better understanding of the microorganisms involved in the biogeochemical cycling of greenhouse gas carbon, and the impact of global warming on their dynamics, are fundamental challenges for microbiologists today. Thirdly, this research program will employ a novel and high-throughput technique for the collection of sequences from the 'rare biosphere', enabling the discovery of organisms that have not yet been detected through traditional cultivation and DNA sequencing techniques.

"Are productivity gains from new manufacturing approaches compromised by lack of attention to human factors? Are innovative production approaches safe for employees? While computer simulation technology is helping today's engineers develop tomorrow's workplaces, the technology rarely accounts for people's capabilities and limitations.   This NSERC 'discovery' research program will develop new approaches for integrating the critical 'Human Factor' into factory design- using the latest in computer simulation technology.  'Human Factors Engineering' aims to use knowledge about people to improve the way we work for better productivity, and also for better employee safety and well being - a win-win proposition.  The World Health Organisation reports that work-related ill health costs up to 4% of the world's gross domestic product.  By including human traits, such our natural variations in performance time or how we fatigue over the day, into computer models it is possible to examine the 'match' between the proposed factory design and the human operators.  This R&D program will develop and validate new simulation approaches to help design teams consider humans in their design work.  Companies considering innovative concepts, such as lean parallel flow rather than serial line production, can use simulation to ensure they reach their intended goals without sacrificing their work-force.  But what happens when gains in one department of the company lead to losses in another department?  Here, simulations of the whole company, sometimes called 'Microworlds', can help managers examine the long term effects of their options - in just seconds.  This is particularly helpful for managing the 'Human Factor' where the costs of poor design might emerge months or years after a manager has chosen a particular design.  This program will adapt current simulation technology to help designers evaluate both human and productivity criteria in their designs, without the large costs of retrofitting or last-minute changes.  Developing innovative workplaces that are highly productive and humanly sustainable is critical for Canada's future growth.  Simulation technology can help reach this goal - if we develop its human side now.","Manufacturing processes and products","Ryerson University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie des facteurs humains","G�nie industriel"

"Modern, deep-water coral carbonate mounds of the northern, circum-Atlantic region are known for their support of a high biodiversity, their record of past climatic and oceanographic changes, and their vulnerability to present environmental perturbation such as ocean ""acidification"". Since their rediscovery in the early 90s of the last century, these deep-water coral mounds are in perennial focus to represent a modern analogue of what geologists know and describe as ""mud-rich carbonate mounds"". Mud-rich carbonate mounds are important geological structures (evolution of the metazoa, hydrocarbon reservoir rocks) that, however, defy a straightforward explanation of their formation. Indeed, their content of fossils does not allow the recognition of a simple skeletal growth framework as it exits in modern and ancient reef rocks. A number of geological evidences point to the fact that these mounds grew literally ""from the inside"" via the authigenic precipitation of carbonate minerals during the degradation and cycling of metazoan tissue and related dissolved organic matter. This project takes advantage of a drilling campaign addressed to modern, deep-water coral mounds off Morocco. At present, these mounds are in a stage of suboxic degradation and therefore will allow the exploration of the microbial and organochemical impact on mound formation ""caught in the act"". This research is performed as an invited Canadian contribution to the MiCROSYSTEMS and CHEMECO projects, two interdisciplinary collaborative research projects of the EUROCORES-EuroDIVERSITY and -EuroDEEP program of the European Science Foundation.","Earth sciences","Universit� Laval",2,"SROPJ ","Special Research Opportunity Program - Project","Sciences de la terre (voir aussi g�ologie marine, 4604)","Sciences de la terre"
"This research project explores the diagenesis of carbonate sediments in relation to both organisms that live near to the sediment surface and the non-living, natural organic matter that exudates into the interstitial environment during their degradation. The primary focus is to monitor the natural process of humification and how it influences, e.g., the formation of organic colloids and authigenic Ca-carbonates. Humification, next to photosynthesis, represents one of the most important transfer mechanisms of organic carbon on Earth. In general, it comprises the transformation of labile, biological macromolecules into geological macromolecules that are stable under the conditions of the Earth's surface. By consequence, and if certain conditions apply, such low-molecular weight humic compounds should be detectable even in geologically mature sedimentary rocks, hundreds of million of years in age. Recent insights from the analysis of modern and ancient sediments indicate that Phanerozoic, fine-grained carbonate mounds acted as a major sink of relatively fresh geopolymers. Humification, in concert with mineral authigenesis, not only offers an explanation for the accretion mechanism of these limestones, it also explains other geological features such as their fluorescence or the early opening of a cavity system. In the short term perspective, this project intends to substantiate our approach by exploring early diagenesis below the sponge bioherms of the Great Bahama Bank. The expected phenomena (calcification of sponge tissue, polycondensation, dissolution of opaline spicules, recrystallisation of aragonite) should serve as a paradigm for the ancient sponge-rich carbonate mounds. Such mounds were much more common in the geological past where they built up to form large structures. Prominent examples of ancient mounds, which I explore for comparison, occur in the Jurassic of the Atlas mountains in Morocco. However, the research interest there has a larger scope in that it also considers recovery from mass extinction, its impact on depositional geometries and the mobilisation of natural organic matter in the deep-burial environment. These issues are important for subsurface prognosis and exploration strategies for hydrocarbon reservoirs.

"The representation theory of p-adic groups is a burgeoning area of research, with strong ties to both Lie theory and to number theory.  Recent years have seen significant advances in the classification and construction of representations of such groups.  A major theme of the research within this proposal is refining these recent results and transferring this knowledge to the associated representation theory of the maximal compact subgroups of these p-adic groups, through the analysis of the branching rules of the representations.



Another aspect of the representation theory of p-adic groups that promises interesting new results is through the so-called orbit method.  The orbits of real Lie groups acting on its Lie algebra play a fundamental role in the construction and classification of representations, but the precise role of such orbits in the corresponding theory over p-adic groups is not yet known.  That said, recent years have seen a new and novel interpretation of the nilpotent orbits of p-adic groups via elements of the associated Bruhat-Tits buildings, and this paves the way to obtaining an intrinsic understanding of the role of these orbits in representation theory.



The sophisticated and abstract mathematics used in the key programs covered by this proposal is also critical to the understanding and development of solutions to problems in coding theory and cryptography.  Providing mathematical training to young researchers in these areas is a valuable application of acquired expertise, and provides a wonderful opportunity for interdisciplinary discovery.  A third aspect of this proposal involves collaborative work with researchers and students in Engineering and Mathematics on current problems in elliptic curve and lattice-based cryptography, as well as space-time codes and Goppa codes.

"Current practice in the design and construction of civil infrastructure is to create 'passive' components and systems. The structural system is fixed at the time of initial construction and remains unchanged throughout the life of the structure unless purposeful intervention is taken. This project challenges the concept that our structures need to remain passive in the future. Through combining advances in materials and sensing technology, the concept of actively controlling and changing the structural system in response to changing loading conditions will be investigated. Specifically technology for adaptive prestressing of concrete beams will be developed. The beam will be constructed of concrete but will have an internal steel tendon which can be stressed to any desired level of tension in response to loads being applied to a beam. Using a biological analogy, the tendon will be similar to a muscle in the body; it will be relaxed when there is no load but will contract when load is present. The amount of contraction will change in response to the amount of load being applied. This concept active or adaptive control will revolutionize the way we conceive of and create future structural systems. 



The short-term objectives of the project are to establish the ability of adaptive systems to control service level behaviour, improve ultimate load response, reduce prestress losses and provide for optimum beam dimensions. In the broader context, the project will help achieve a Canadian national strategic research objective of creating smart systems and technologies which promote the use of advanced materials and sensing technology to produce new design and management solutions for physical infrastructure.

"Magnetic resonance imaging is well-known as a diagnostic clinical tool. Less well-known is the fact that MR images can be used to measure diffusion and flow velocities. Our research is focused on advances in the MRI measurement of fluid movements, in gases and in liquids, in turbulent flows, bubbly flows, and even in flames. With NSERC support, we have developed a new MRI method which is capable of imaging much faster and more turbulent flows (which have short-lived MRI signals) than previously possible. The research funded in this proposal extends those measurements to gas flows approaching Mach 1 and to multi-phase flows which are critical in the energy industry.



The research has two thrusts. In the first, we are improving the motion sensitization of existing MRI methods for materials which give rise to short-lived (fleeting) responses. We are developing measurement of acceleration, of velocity correlations and of turbulence kinetic energy, which are all critical parameters in describing turbulent flows. In the second thrust, we are developing new ways to image samples with fleeting MRI responses, by using shaped pulses of radiofrequency excitation. These new MRI tools will eventually also be motion sensitized, to add to the range of techniques with which complicated fluid motion can be understood.

"Babies can learn their first language with hardly any instruction, and young children can learn second languages almost as easily. Remarkably, babies whose parents are deaf and use sign language learn sign language as easily and fluently as hearing children learn a spoken language. But adults and even older children have more trouble learning languages, even after years of instruction and practice. One goal of this project is to identify the ""core"" brain regions used in both spoken and signed languages. Additionally, we wish to understand how different language experiences, such as sign language exposure or second language learning at different ages, affect brain development. 



These questions will be addressed through a series of studies using non-invasive brain imaging. One technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), shows which brain areas ""light up"" during certain tasks such as understanding language. Another technique, event-related potentials (""brain waves"") allows us to track the time course of brain activation down to the millisecond. A third technique uses MRI to see how different brain areas are connected. We will use these techniques in concert to examine where and when in the brain different types of information, including language, gesture, and other body movements, are processed.



This research will have many benefits for Canadians. We will better understand how different language experiences shape the development of the brain. Understanding the effects of different experiences, such as sign language or second language learning, in shaping the brain will have a number of real-world impacts. These include better design of language education programs, deciding when it is best to expose children to different language experiences, and guiding brain surgeons and those treating brain injuries such as stroke.

"This project is intended to understand better how bacteria grow and divide.

The bacterium we study, E. coli, can make a new cell every 35 minutes if one feeds it well enough. We know a lot about the structures which it makes in order to divide into two cells, but we don't know much about how it decides whether a particular time is suited for division. It has to determine that everything is ready to divide, but how does it do that?

Our new ideas on this subject should enable us to say more exactly how E. coli knows the time is ripe. Of course, if one knows how it decides to divide, one can interfere with that decision system and inhibit it. This provides a new line of thought for designing antimcrobial therapies, apart from being of fundamental interest in the understanding of cell division.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Concordia University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�n�tique mol�culaire","G�n�tique"

"Learning to read requires forming associations between the sounds (i.e., phonology), spellings (i.e., orthography), and meanings (i.e., semantics) of words. While there is a general consensus that phonology influences reading acquisition, theories differ in the importance they assign to phonological information in skilled readers. So-called strong phonological theories propose that computation of phonology occurs early and automatically in the course of reading. An alternative view assigns less importance to phonology, arguing that phonological influences are dependent on factors such as reading skill. The focus of my research program is to define the time course of phonological processing as a means of adjudicating between these opposing views.



This will be achieved through the application of event-related brain potential (ERP) measures. ERP methodology is used extensively by researchers to study the time course of cognitive processes in the brain. ERP measures provide extremely good temporal information (i.e., on the order of milliseconds) concerning when cognitive processing occurs in the brain. ERP measures are analogous to a movie camera that films cognitive processing moment-by-moment. The ERP system that is funded by this proposal will be used to study the time-line of phonological processing in skilled readers. This methodology will permit me to examine, for instance, whether phonology is activated before or after the meaning of a word is computed. Knowledge of how skilled reading is accomplished is critical to improving our understanding of reading disabilities and for developing effective tools for literacy education.

"Reading is not only a form of enjoyment, it is a prerequisite skill for achieving educational and employment success. Learning to read requires forming associations between the sounds (i.e., phonology), spellings (i.e., orthography), and meanings (i.e., semantics) of words. While it is widely accepted that phonology is critical to beginning readers, the role of phonology in skilled reading is more controversial. More specifically, it has been proposed that as reading skills improve, children rely less on phonology and more on orthography to recognize words. Experiments in my lab examine whether, in fact, there is a shift in reliance from phonology to orthgraphy by studying both beginning readers and skilled adult readers. These studies involve the use of cutting edge brain imaging techniques to reveal how the brain represents phonology, orthography, and semantics. An appreciation of how the brain processes written language is critical for understanding childhood reading problems and for developing effective educational strategies for teaching literacy.

"Empirical data on materials performance in supercritical water (SCW) are mostly confined to commercial alloys that are broadly designed for their mechanical properties and aqueous corrosion resistance. Little consideration has been given to the hybrid nature of the SCW environment, in that corrosion occurs by mechanisms that combine features of low-temperature, aqueous, and high-temperature, gaseous, corrosion. Atomic oxygen is mobile in the metal, and significant diffusion of alloying elements can also occur, at least along short-circuit paths such as grain boundaries. Such diffusion fundamentally alters the nature of the corrosion and stress corrosion problem. This project will start from the hypothesis that SCW corrosion (and stress corrosion) can only be understood by recognizing the hybrid 'low temperature aqueous'-'high temperature gaseous' nature of the corrosion mechanism. From there, attempts will be made to develop new alloys that could be suitable as coatings or even monolithic materials. Advanced transmission electron microscopy and surface analysis will underpin most of the interpretation.","Materials sciences","University of Toronto",2,"NNAPJ ","NSERC/NRCan/AECL Generation IV Energy Technologies Program","Science et technologie des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"
"Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is the slow growth of cracks under the simultaneous influence of a tensile stress and a reactive environment. Usually the term is applied to metals, although glasses and ceramics can also show related phenomena. SCC has enormous engineering importance in a wide range of industries. In metals, which are the subject of this proposal, there have always been fierce arguments as to the nanoscale events that occur at the tips of such cracks. Recently, new tools and theories have evolved that can aspire to observe and model such events. However they have been used mainly to study complex engineering alloys in difficult environments such as high-temperature water, or in the case of certain atomistic modelling schemes, materials that are more like brittle solids than metals. In this project, we will revert to easily studied model alloy systems and apply a range of modern approaches to them. This should greatly advance the foundations of the subject.

"Nuclear energy in Canada is going through a period of immense opportunities and challenges. UNENE, the

University Network of Excellence in Nuclear Engineering, has pooled industry money to create, in partnership

with NSERC, a number of Industrial Research Chair programs. The Toronto Chair addresses the area of

materials performance, and in particular metallic corrosion. This is important to the industry for several reasons

- to predict and extend the life of current plant, to aid materials selection and plant performance for new and

refurbished plant, and to aid the safe management of nuclear waste and used nuclear fuel. Fundamental

research will be carried out in areas of critical interest to the industry, leading to specific applications. One

strand of the research deals with complex corrosion phenomena in nuclear steam generators that used to be

considered high-temperature (i.e. operating) issues, but in some cases are now thought to occur during plant

outages. Another area of interest is the fact that cracking of certain steel components occurs in one plant but not

in another; experimental and statistical approaches will be used to probe the underlying causal factors and the

risk, if any, in the apparently immune plants. Another is the ability to insert monitoring probes into used-fuel

storage containers to gain confidence in their integrity. Another project within the program looks forward to

new surface treatments that could be used in advanced reactor systems. Meanwhile, there is a continued

emphasis on the very fundamentals of corrosion, including atomistic simulation of alloy corrosion behaviour.

The Chair program has wide international collaboration and links with allied areas of materials science and

electrochemistry.

"The long term objective is to numerically model the effects of workpiece micro structure and process parameters on residual stresses generate in the machined surface after single point turning. Short term research is comprised of studies on a) develop a combine numerical and experimental method to determine the friction coefficient along the tool-chip interface and investigate the operating boundary for this method, b) design using the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation technique to simulate the effects of sequential cut, cutting edge radius and feed on residual stresses, c) develop a numerical model to simulate the effects of workpiece microstructure and phase transformation on residual stresses and d) numerically and experimentally investigate the effects of flank wear length, cutting edge radius to feed ratio, tool coating, and process parameters on residual stresses. This research will develop a unique methodology to acquire actual friction coefficient induced during machining by using both numerical and experimental approaches. The effect of tool holder on tool deflection during the cutting process will also be modeled. Influence of sequential cut on the final residual stress profile will also be analyzed. The F.E. model developed to predict residual stresses will be based on either an implicit solver or analytical approach, which will reduced computational time substantially. Models will also be developed to predict the highly complex effects of phase transformation and workpiece micro structure on residual stresses. The significant of this research is to enhance the knowledge on modeling of residual stresses, which will enable researchers to optimize machining parameters for fatigue loaded components in the aerospace, medical and automotive sectors in terms of maximization of compressive residual stresses in both magnitude and penetration depth. Furthermore, this technology will assist design for manufacture protocol in reduction of post machining stages like shot peening, improved fatigue performance and reduce part distortion induced by residual stresses. Residual stress seminar will be organised at McMaster for Mechanical, Materials & Manufacturing engineers to present research discovery from this grant.

The proposal has two components:  one project is to develop a new green process to upgrade Canada's vast reserve of oil sands bitumen and heavy oil and the other is to develop a green process for biodiesel production. 



Upgrading of Canada's vast reserve of heavy oil and bitumen requires a large consumption of hydrogen which is expensive and in short supply. We have patented a process whereby the water that is present in the recovery of the heavy oil and bitumen could be utilized to produce hydrogen in situ as well as reducing waste residue. This proposal is designed to develop more active catalysts for in situ hydrogen generation and to further investigate the use of water itself to provide a hydrogen source for upgrading the heavy oil and emulsion.  



Biodiesel is a renewable energy that is derived from biomass. Current processes for biodiesel production use a liquid catalyst such as NaOH or H2SO4 which are not environmentally friendly. There are potential benefits to utilize catalytic distillation for biodiesel production. However, a suitable catalytic distillation packing which functions both as a catalyst and separation device has to be developed. This portion of the proposal is focused on the development of catalytic distillation packings that could be used for the production of biodiesel. Process modeling will be carried out to design a catalytic distillation process for biodiesel production.

"Funds are requested for the purchase of a Nd:YAG dual cavity pulsed laser system for non-intrusive fluid flow measurements and visualization. The requested laser system is a necessary major component to complete a new particle image velocimetry (PIV) diagnostics facility developing in the combustion and energy systems laboratory at Concordia University. The new PIV system established in the laboratory will represent an important infrastructure to measure the instantaneous global velocity field in a flowing fluid, and such diagnostics facility is essential to the proposed research in the short- and long-term.



   The requested laser system is very compact and portable that can be easily adapted for different research projects. This laser system will be used continuously as an effective flow measurement tool by the applicant who have diverse research areas from fundamental research of classical vortex and surface wave dynamics, combustion dynamics, to more applied engineering subject in wind power, where laser diagnostics and PIV flow measurement play a significant role. The proposed laser together with other NSERC funded infrastructures such as the wind tunnel and shock tube will be used by at least 5 graduate students in the coming four years, and will be fully utilized on other research projects in the future. 



   The requested equipment is also a necessary replacement of an old NSERC funded laser owned by Dr. Siddiqui, who recently moved from Concordia University to the University of Western Ontario bringing with him all his equipments which are no longer available for the applicant. The projects supported by this equipment belong to the alternative energy and environmental research which are target areas focused by NSERC and Concordia's strategic plan.

"In order to address energy related environmental issues of gas emissions and supply problems, there is an urgent need to investigate alternative fuels and energy systems such as hydrogen, syngas, dimethyl ether and bio-fuels. The combustion properties and the safety aspects associated with production, handling, transportation and storage of alternative fuels must be understood with a sufficient level of confidence in order to achieve public acceptance of wide spread utilization of these alternative fuels and to migrate to these possible fuel economies. A five-year experimental and computational research program is proposed to investigate the combustion characteristics and detonation properties of potential future alternative fuels. The objectives are to obtain new experimental combustion and detonation data particularly at high pressure conditions relevant to real storage and engine/gas turbine applications and to develop advanced mathematical/computational models capable of elucidating the fundamental mechanisms that underlie the evolutionary behavior of the detonation structure, the processes for flame acceleration, deflagration to detonation transition, dispersion/mixing dynamics and effect of the confining boundary and compressible turbulence in the alternative fuels systems. Chemical kinetics analyses are also carried out to explore the reaction sensitivity of the alternative fuels at different initial conditions, to design fuel blends for increasing safety, to balance the effect between ease of ignition and resistance to detonation (engine knock) in engine design, and to improve emission control. This project will systematically optimize and reduce the currently available kinetics models suitable for computational fluid dynamics using advanced mathematical techniques. 

  This program is related to the general research and development of alternative energy. It will not only improve the knowledge base of combustion/explosion behavior of different alternative fuels and deliver numerical models for safety assessment and engineering system design but also provide fundamental knowledge on explosion dynamics, high pressure/temperature chemistry and turbulence interactions in reactive flow.","Energy storage and conversion","Concordia University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie m�canique","G�nie m�canique"

"Protein-protein interactions are critical for many important biological processes.  In the two divergent fields of viral replication and the regulation of plant metabolism, we are establishing a molecular structural basis for understanding the complex network of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions underlying these processes.  To achieve this goal, we have developed efficient methods for producing milligram quantities of the central enzymes and regulatory proteins.  A suite of biochemical and biophysical methods have also being used to measure binding interactions and enzyme activities.  Finally, crystallization screening and X-ray crystallography are used to provide high resolution three-dimensional information on protein complexes.  This structural information provides a rational basis for the design of mutagenesis experiments to further probe the importance of specific interactions in both viral replication and plant metabolism.  Ultimately, this information also provides the basis for developing novel antiviral therapeutics for important human and animal diseases, as well as for the improvement of plant crops under conditions of nitrogen limitation.

"Biomarkers are indicators used to objectively measure and evaluate normal biological processes, pathogenic processes or pharmacological responses to therapeutic interventions. In medical practice, biomarkers facilitate diagnosis and prognosis of disease, as well as monitoring clinical response to therapy. In environmental studies, biomarkers can be used to assess the health states of animals and plants, with respect to, for instance, the amounts of toxic materials they are exposed. Advancements in the fields of genomics and proteomics have revolutionized novel biomarker discovery with new tools for high throughput strategies. In this proposal, we present a comprehensive framework for using large amounts of genomics and proteomics data for identifying biomarkers and signatures. The proposal has three key focuses: (A) data cleansing and pre-processing; (B) biomarker and signature identification; and (C) validation with real data sets. 



For data cleansing and pre-processing, we consider a range of topics:  (A1) Quality control for microarray data; (A2) Proteomics platform calibration; and (A3) Formation of protein groups for proteomics data. We emphasize that before data can be mined, they need to be properly cleansed and transformed.  For biomarker and signature identification, we explore a number of key topics: (B1) Gene set enrichment analysis; (B2) Ensemble methods for combinatorial analysis; and (B3) Embedded clustering methods during biomarker discovery. Last but not least, for the objective of validation with real data sets, we discuss how the aforementioned tasks will be applied to two large-scale genomics and proteomics data sets funded by Genome Canada and NSERC.

"Current nano-meter scale VLSI technology has advanced to a point where the amount of power consumed in a typical VLSI chip under maximum performance situation could cause overheat and even become destructive. Traditional power management solutions aimed at distributing a prescribed amount of power to specific circuit blocks over specific periods of time, via control software. While some form of power optimization can be achieved by taking into account the clock frequency, supply voltage and temperature, many issues remains. This includes the development of the new power/energy management strategies that takes process variations, temperature and aging effects, dynamics of the control loops, and the efficiency of the entire system into account.

The scope of this project can be divided into 3 modules, on-chip monitoring circuits, power management software, and power supplies. The development of on-chip monitoring circuits will include a new set of area-efficient circuits to accurately detect the voltage and temperature of the VLSI chip and to quantify the process (and aging) variations specific to each individual VLSI chip. These circuits will communicate with the power management control software program to dynamically change the operating voltage and/or frequency. To select a new operating point, the control software uses the current values of the chip's temperature and supply voltage to calculate the new voltage and frequency setting. In addition, the control software must also communicate with the operating system to continuously meet the computation requirements. Finally, re-configurable digitally controlled DC-DC converters capable of adapting to a wide range of loading conditions must also be developed. These DC-DC converters will communicate continuously with the power management control software to ensure efficient conversion of the battery voltage to an appropriate supply voltage for the VLSI load.

"The power consumed by modern VLSI chips under maximum performance situation could cause over-heat and even become destructive. This is especially critical in portable multimedia and telecommunication products where form factor, cooling and battery life impose very stringent limitations. In addition, a substantial amount of unwanted standby power due to the inherent CMOS leakage current is also consumed. Power management is currently one of the most critical enabling technologies to further increase VLSI performance and integration density. Dynamically scaling of the power supply voltage and clock frequency according to performance needs has been investigated for more than 10 years. Most of the previous work focused only on saving power at the VLSI chip level. The design of the power efficient variable output power supplies (DC-DC Converters) is often assumed to be trivial and as an afterthought. While significant power saving has been reported at the VLSI chip level, the overall power saving at the system level is often worse than expected.

This proposal is to develop a VLSI power management technology that can be seamlessly incorporated into future VLSI design methodologies. Minimum overall power consumption will be achieved via the monitoring of battery condition and on-chip operating temperature, the use of reconfigurable digitally controlled DC-DC converters, and a dedicated power management controller to provide task scheduling and dynamic supply voltage scaling (DVS) functions. The power management controller will dynamically reconfigure the digitally controlled DC-DC converters to provide high conversion efficiency under all loading conditions. This project encompasses a multi-disciplinary research effort ranging from the study of power management control software, nano-scale CMOS fabrication technology, the development of energy efficient VLSI circuits and DC-DC converters. The successful development of the proposed power management technology will lead to optimized utilization of the available battery power in all future portable multimedia and telecommunication products.

"The ability to assess egg quality rapidly and effectively is an important goal of egg packing houses and egg processing plants. The candling technique that is currently widely used can be laborious and not adaptable to on-line implementation. In-fertile eggs that are identified and removed on time can pose significant safety and economic problems for hatcheries. Thus, the development of an efficient, non-destructive and accurate method for assessing quality and detect fertility and the hatchability of eggs especially at the transfer stage would be very advantageous to the poultry industry. In the proposed research, the potentials of hyperspectral imaging techniques will be exploited to develop techniques for egg quality assessment and prediction of hatchability. The goals of the study are to obtain hyperspectral images of egg at the VIS/NIR wavelengths and to correlate these images with corresponding changes in various internal egg quality attributes related to albumen and yolk quality, and the presence of blood or meat spots, freshness parameters (Haugh Units and pH), fertility and hatchability of intact eggs. Predictive models and algorithms will be developed using statistical methods and advanced artificial intelligence based techniques to classify eggs and predict egg fertility and hatchability. The novel hyperspectral imaging system will be based on the information collected using wider range of spectrum (400 to 1700 nm) than has currently been reported in the literature for egg quality evaluation. The technology that will be developed will greatly reduce subjectivity in detecting embryo development and in assessing quality, fertility and hatchability of eggs and it will also replace the highly time consuming and tedious candling method currently used to determine various egg quality attributes. The research team has expertise covering food engineering, hyperspectral imaging and poultry science. Highly qualified personnel will be trained.

"Most foods are coated with batter before frying. Batter coatings provide opportunities to design fried products with unique sensory and textural attributes. They significantly modify heat and mass transfer characteristics during frying. The increasing emphasis on quality of fried foods have continued to present new challenges that will require fundamental science and engineering knowledge to address adequately. Progress in the past years indicate that batter formulation (flour, ingredients, etc.), its transformation (protein denaturation, gelatinization, etc.) as well as its structure (density, porosity, pore size distribution, microstructure, etc) may be among the key elements in understanding batter coating functionalities. The objectives of the proposed research program include investigating the influence of flour types and ingredients on fat absorption and texture of fried batter systems; and studying the development of starch granule gelatinization, protein network formation and porous structure in fried batters and batter coated products. Textural characteristics will be measured using the Universal Instron Testing Machine and fractal analysis. The Confocal Scanning Laser Microscopy (CSLM) technique coupled with image analysis will be used to examine fat distributions as well as water, starch and protein changes in the fried products. Structure of battered products will be studied from 3 fronts namely porosimetry, CSLM and x-ray micro-computed tomographic (MCT) methods. Protocol for obtaining quantitative data on pores and pore size distributions, previously developed in our laboratory, will be extended for batters. Appropriate protocols will be developed for the CSLM and x-ray tomography studies with combined image analysis. The x-ray MCT is a particularly novel method for reconstructing 3-D visualization of pores in the fried products. The 3 techniques will be combined to obtain a comprehensive analysis of porous structure development in the fried products. A 3-D pore network model will be developed and used to interpret texture and fat absorption characteristics. The project will actively engage graduate students and a research associate. It will provide excellent opportunities for training food engineering personnel.","Processed food products and beverages","McGill University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Transformation, conditionnement, conservation et stockage des aliments","Science et technologie de l'alimentation"

"The potential of nanostructured ceramic-metal composites to possess higher resistance to temperature, load, wear and corrosion compared to conventional composites has been proven in the past years. However, these materials could not succeed technologically because of the coarsening and dissolution of nano-particles during thermal processes and elevated cost. The proposed research program therefore aims at developing high performance and low cost composite materials and coatings based on nanotechnology and dispersion strengthening. Powders with thermally stable ceramic nano-particles in a relatively low melting metal matrix will be developed. This combination, together with relatively low processing temperatures, will insure minimisation or even elimination of nano-particle coarsening and dissolution. High energy Mechanical Alloying (MA) will be used.  MA crushes conventional micro-size ceramic powders down to nano-size and forces them simultaneously into the metal matrix at a low temperature. One fraction of the produced powders will be used to develop coatings by HVOF thermal spraying. During HVOF spraying, combustion of oxygen and fuel enables heating and projecting semi-molten powder particles onto the substrate surface to create a coating. The other powder fraction will be used to develop composite materials and components by powder metallurgy, which consists of compacting and sintering. The emphasis for composites with ceramic fractions below 2% b.w. (by weight) will be the strengthening of aluminium, silver, copper, chromium and their alloys for applications requiring electrical conductivity and resistance to high temperature. Potential applications include interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) as well as medium and high voltage contacts and switches. Composites with ceramic fractions above 50% b.w. will target components subjected to strong wear. Potential applications are seals and valves for oil pumps, as well as components for gas turbines and reactors. Canada will benefit from the higher performance of components and from the reduction of wear and failure damage, downtime and maintenance costs of machines and equipment, especially for key energy industries.","Manufacturing processes and products","University of Ottawa",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie m�canique","G�nie m�canique"

"    )	A single amino acid mutation, proline residue at position 56 substituted by serine (P56S), in a previously identified gene named VAPB causes late-onset, autosomal dominant form of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS8). VAPB is a protein anchored to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a cellular network of membranes that is the entry point for secretory and membrane proteins. The ER has a quality control feature to ensure that proteins are correctly folded before they can leave the ER en route to their final destinations. Expression of VAPB-P56S disrupts this quality control feature and slows down the exit of proteins from the ER. This creates a protein traffic jam that eventually causes aggregation and stress to the ER. Cells have an adaptive process known as the unfolded protein response or UPR to counteract ER stress. UPR is designed to reduce the effect of increased protein load by (1) expanding the membrane capacity of the ER to accommodate the increased load; (2) by promoting the degradation of unfolded proteins; and (3) by temporarily shutting down new protein synthesis to reduce the amount of proteins entering the ER. However, if these countermeasures fail to relieve the stress, genes leading to cell death are then activated to eliminate the affected cell. We have discovered that a short peptide sequence known as the FFAT motif (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract) can change the activity of VAPB. It rescued the defect caused by the P56S mutation, so that proteins can now effectively leave the ER thereby relieving stress to the ER. This study will determine how the ALS8 mutation changes the UPR, and how FFAT resolves the ER membrane aggregates. It will explore whether this approach can be applied to other aggregate-prone neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's and Parkinson's Diseases.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","University of Ottawa",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Membranes cellulaires","Biologie cellulaire"

"The wireless radio channel poses a severe challenge as a transmission medium for reliable high-speed communications. As a signal propagates through a wireless channel, it experiences random fluctuations in time due to changing reflections and attenuation. This random variation of the channel quality is generally referred to as fading and it is the main reason for poor performance of wireless transmission. Diversity offers an effective solution to combat fading by providing the receiver with multiple copies of the same information that are effectively transmitted with independent channel gains. Spatial diversity with the use of multiple transmit and/or receive antennas is the most effective and attractive diversity method. Achieving the full diversity gain, however, requires multiple antennas be placed sufficiently far apart, which is problematic for size-limited terminals. An alternative approach to provide spatial diversity without using multiple antennas is cooperative communications. This approach is motivated by the fact that the wireless channels from different users to the destination are likely to fade independently and users can assist each other with the transmission of their messages. Because information is transmitted multiple times, once from the user itself and then from the partnering users (or relays), spatial diversity can be achieved. Cooperative diversity has been recognized as a very promising solution for future wireless ad-hoc and wireless sensor networks. Developing practical transmission schemes to realize cooperative diversity is the main subject of this proposed research, which includes both user-cooperation diversity and cooperative diversity with the help of relays and network coding. Different from the previous works, our emphasis is placed on the high bandwidth efficiency of the cooperative schemes in order to support high data-rate transmission. The research work includes both analysis and computer simulation to develop and evaluate the performance of the new techniques. The success of the proposed research program should enhance Canada's competitive position in providing advanced broadband wireless communications systems.

"In a wireless mesh network (WMN), wireless routers provide multi-hop connectivity from a host to either other hosts in the same network or the Internet, enabling networking capability where a wired infrastructure is unavailable or expensive to deploy (e.g., rural areas, water surfaces, hard-to-wire buildings).   Group communications (or multicast) are a form of communication that delivers information from a source to a set of destinations simultaneously in an efficient manner.  Multicast supports many important applications such as distribution of stock quotes, financial data, billing records, software, newspapers, pay-per-view movies; audio/video conference; distance learning; and distributed online games.  Although multicast plays an important role in these applications, research on multicasting in WMNs is still in its infancy.   Few well-designed and well-tested solutions are currently available, and they focus on only one aspect of communications (e.g., routing).   In this long-term project, we propose a comprehensive suite of protocols to support efficient and secure group communications in WMNs, which addresses the following main problems:  routing; flow/congestion control; quality-of-service guarantees for real-time and multimedia applications; reliable multicast; network security provision; host mobility management; and inter-operations with the Internet and other types of wireless networks .   Wireless mesh networking has proven to be a key technology for next-generation wireless networks.   This project, upon completion, will enable multicast services to be extended to areas served by wireless mesh technologies such as remote areas, small towns,  water surfaces, and transporation systems.   The success of the project not only contributes to the advancement of wireless networking, but also makes significant impacts on Canada's economy (distribution of financial data, advertising), health care system (remote medical diagnosis), technology (distributed interactive simulations, multimedia communications), education system (distance learning), social communication (news distribution, tele-conferencing), and entertainment industry (pay-per-view movies, online games).

"Extreme rainfalls and the resulting floods were the number one cause of deaths and property damage by natural disasters in many regions. In particular, a number of extreme storm events with significant impacts on the environment and socio-economic activities have occurred during the last decade across Canada, including those severe storms causing the heavy flood in Saguenay region in Quebec in 1996 and the critical Red River flooding event in Manitoba in 1997. Moreover, there is now a broad scientific consensus that the global climate is changing in ways that are likely to have a profound impact on human society and the natural environment over the coming decades. Furthermore, it has been recognized that changes in the frequency and magintude of extreme climate events are likely to have more substantial and widespread impacts on the environment and human activities than changes in the mean climate. There is hence an urgent need to improve our understanding on the occurrence of extreme storms in the coming decades, and to develop new tools for improving our ability to assess more accurately the impacts of such extremes on Canada's social, economic, and natural environment. The overall objective of the proposed research plan is therefore to advance scientific knowledge on the occurence of extreme storms, and to improve society's ability to manage the risks associated with these extremes by creating and developing improved tools and methods for producing high-quality impact assessments.  The proposed research topic is important because it deals almost exclusively with issues that have been received considerable attention in Canada and abroad due to substantial investment involved.  It is expected that results of this study will ultimately help engineers to develop more cost-effective methods for design and management of water resource systems, and will assist policy-makers in formulating more robust policies to mitigate the impacts of these extreme events, thereby contributing to national economic competitiveness, the effectiveness of public policy, and the quality of life.

"The Canadian pulp and paper industry is facing increasing competition from countries such as Brazil, Indonesia and China, which rely on inexpensive raw material and labour.  To maintain a healthy and competitive industry, the industry needs innovations in the development of improved manufacturing processes and/or of new, value-added products.  Drs. Ni and Xiao have demonstrated a strong record of developing and commercializing technologies.  The requested equipment is vital in order to further enhance their capacity in developing new technologies/products which will have significant impact to the pulp and paper industry.



The determination of chlorine-containing species such as chlorate, chlorite, is of critical importance to the development of improved chlorine dioxide bleaching/brightening technologies; also, the sugar analysis in the pre-hydrolysis liquor is crucial to convert hemicellulose into value-added products.  We are requesting an Ion Chromatograph (IC) which has the capacity of these analyses.  There is no such instrument currently in service in the Faculty of Engineering (neither on the UNB Fredericton campus). There is an urgent need for the requested instrument to ensure our research proceeds effectively. The IC system from Dionex is unique for these capacities; its cost is $77,703. The research program led by Drs. Ni and Xiao will benefit immediately from the acquisition of such a system.  It will be used to determine the fundamental chemistry (various ionic species, and carbohydrate compositions) of the innovative processes to be developed. Without this equipment, the quality of our research outcomes and progress towards meeting the research objectives for Drs. Ni and Xiao's research program will be severely compromised or jeopardized.  The success of this application will not only benefit the research groups of Drs. Ni and Xiao, but also other researchers at UNB. Training of graduate students, undergraduate students, and PDFs is a significant component of this application.

"The goal of this project is to maintain and increase the competitiveness of the Canadian pulp and paper industry

by making better use of wood and fibre resources. This will be achieved by applying state-of-the-art technology

and tools to measure wood and fibre quality in the forest, quantify fibre variability, and identify regions with

superior wood quality in order to extract maximum value from the forest resource. Pulp and paper is the largest

manufacturing industry in Canada and is particularly important to the economy of Atlantic Canada, where the

forest industry represents approximately $2.6 billion in real GDP and over 25,000 primary jobs. The proposed

research, to be conducted in collaboration with partners Paprican and Corner Brook Pulp and Paper, will

improve the cost-competitiveness of the industry by linking incoming fibre quality to process and product

performance, and providing the tools to monitor and control incoming wood quality for improved process

stability, reduced operating costs and enhanced product performance.

The key objectives of the project are to use state-of-the-art field sensors to measure properties in standing trees

or on chip streams feeding Corner Brook Pulp and Paper, establish databases of wood and fibre properties that

can be incorporated into a digital forest inventory (GIS) framework, and develop models relating key wood and

fibre properties to processing parameters and end-product properties. The technical challenges will be to apply

the new optical (NIR-based) sensor technologies by developing accurate calibration curves that are specific to

the Corner Brook region of Newfoundland. Although the project is focused on the wood/fibre supply chain of

Corner Brook Pulp and Paper, the industry partner for this project, it will be a demonstration case for the

"Significant quantities of common drugs are produced each year, many of which have been detected in surface waters across Canada. These and other pharmaceutically active compounds (PACs) end up in the environment through untreated and treated effluents. While their concentrations are extremely low, evidence is growing about the adverse effects of exposing aquatic organisms to PACs that exert toxic, estrogenic or other physiological effects. Unfortunately, while municipalities are relying on wastewater treatment plants to remove these compounds from effluents before they are disposed into surface water bodies, such treatment systems have been shown to be quite ineffective. In anticipation of the future implementation of strict guidelines governing the release of PACs, it is necessary to identify and prioritize compounds that are likely to be of greatest concern and to develop treatment approaches to accomplish their removal from waste streams.  Therefore, the following objectives are proposed: (1) methods will be developed to predict mass emission rates of PACs from communities, to estimate their concentrations at various stages along the waste train (i.e., from source to influent to effluent), and to explore locations along the waste train where treatment technologies should be implemented; (2) emission rate estimates will be coupled with watershed models to predict concentrations of PACs in surface waters in order to form a basis for the evaluation of risks and the prioritization of efforts for regulating the release of PACs; and (3) enzyme catalysis will be investigated as a method for targeting the treatment of problematic PACs to prevent their uncontrolled release into surface waters.  The latter work builds on the extensive research conducted in our laboratory to explore environmental applications of enzymes. The research will involve studies of the ability of oxidoreductases to oxidize PACs in real wastes, evaluation of the feasibility of treating PACs at locations ranging from source to polished effluent, and development of approaches to enhance reaction rates and minimize enzyme costs.",Environment,"McGill University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Traitement des eaux us�es","G�nie de l'environnement"

"The long-term strategy for this new research program is to better understand the interactions between food-grade plant proteins and polysaccharides, and their structure-controlling role as food ingredients. Protein-polysaccharide interactions play significant roles in controlling structure, texture and stability in food systems, coatings and packaging materials. In order to control these interactions to give desired functionality (e.g., gel/film-forming, emulsifying, foaming, etc.), a greater understanding of the factors affecting these interactions is required. Within the initial phase of the program (2008-2013), mechanisms associated with protein-polysaccharide interactions will be studied under conditions driven by attractive forces, their assembly into larger structures, and their subsequent influence on the flow behaviour (viscosity) or gelling abilities in model food systems. Outcomes from this program could lead to improved functionality of plant proteins, and greater utilization as ingredients for food. Fundamental knowledge gained as part of this program could also be transitioned into the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and biomedical arenas for controlled delivery applications. Canadian consumers, along with food, biomedical and biomaterial industries are expected to benefit directly from this research. Advanced HQP training within this program will provide trainees with extensive fundamental knowledge of food proteins and advanced instruments used to study them; preparing HQP for careers in academia, government or the food industry.","Processed food products and beverages","University of Saskatchewan",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Science et technologie de l'alimentation","Science et technologie de l'alimentation"

"Despite recent advances in wind erosion research, little detailed knowledge is currently available regarding the localized atmospheric, surficial and textural variables that directly control both sediment supply and available shear stress at the bed. The proposed research program builds on the results and experience gained from our recent field and laboratory studies and will focus on specific surficial and textural factors that control the sediment supply and transport of sand and dust. Results of this work will provide necessary input for the long-term goal of developing a comprehensive sediment transport model accounting for the temporal and spatial variability of dust emissions and dust storm development. The proposed research program has two distinct but interrelated components. We will first carry out a detailed field and laboratory wind tunnel evaluations of the Raupach et al. (1993) shear stress partitioning model and the more recent Okin and Gillette (2006) non-equilibrium lateral cover model using simulated vegetation elements having a range of porosities, sizes, aspect ratios, spacing patterns and surface cover. This work will be undertaken in the Department of Geography, University of Guelph 15m sediment transport tunnel using newly developed instrumentation that can simultaneously and independently measure the wind force on individual plant elements and the bare intervening surface as well as the sediment transport rate at sampling frequencies from 1 to 10 Hz. A complimentary field investigation will also be carried out at the USDA Jornada Experimental Range, New Mexico, which is located in an arid environment dominated by mesquite and creosote shrubland. At several sites, having different vegetation types and per cent cover high speed measurements of wind speed, direction will be made above and within the sparse vegetation canopies using traditional anemometry. Surface drag and drag on individual elements will also be made using unique instrumentation developed at Guelph. Sediment transport rates measured within the vegetation by electronic saltation sensors will be related to the wind flow, surface shear stress distribution and vegetation characteristics.","Earth sciences","University of Guelph",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�omorphologie","Sciences de la terre"

"Bilingual children sometimes put words together in such a way that they sound like they are translating word-for-word from their other language. For example, a Spanish-English bilingual child might say 'an elephant gray' in English, based on the noun-adjective Spanish ordering, rather than 'a gray elephant'. This phenomenon is referred to as cross-linguistic transfer.

      Researchers have proposed several possible explanations of cross-linguistic transfer, usually based in a grammatical theory such as Chomsky's Universal Grammar. These explanations are insufficient, as cross-linguistic transfer as been reported within words (e.g., a French-English bilingual using the word 'bluise', a blend of 'bruise' and the French 'bleu'), as well as in grammar. Our recent research has suggested that it is useful to think of cross-linguistic transfer within the framework of speech production.

     Speech production models often assume a roughly serial-order process. Speakers first activate the concepts they wish to convey. They then choose the words and syntactic frame(s) associated with these concepts. Finally, they activate the appropriate pronunciation of the words and syntactic frame(s) and then produce an utterance. Such models often explain speech errors as the result of competing ways of phrasing the same message. For example, a person who used bot the word 'sofa' and 'Chesterfield' might occasionally say something like 'sesterfield' or 'chofa', a blend of both words. Speech errors are known to occur in syntax, lexical choice and phonology. And, speech errors occur more frequently in children than adults.

     The purpose of the proposed grant is to test some of the predictions that fall out of using a speech production model to explain bilingual children's cross-linguistic transfer. If these predictions are upheld, then the source of bilingual children's speech errors could be considered the same as in monolingual children: competition between different ways of phrasing the same message. Bilingual children might make some more errors than monolinguals because of the competition both between and within languages.",Psychology,"University of Alberta",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Science cognitive -- d�veloppement",Psychologie
"The 2007 edition if ITRS (The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors) emphasizes the ""More Than Moore's Law"" movement. This movement focuses on system integration rather than transistor density and will lead to a functional diversification in integrated systems. This diversification allows for non-digital functionalities such as RF, power control, optical and/or mechanical components, sensors and actuators to migrate from the system board level into a package level (SiP) or chip level (SoC) implementation. These heterogeneous systems will enable new application and open new markets. They will be found in key domains like transport, security, health, energy.  However, the design of these heterogeneous systems is still a challenge and more research is required at the technological, architectural and system level. An integrated hierarchical design approach is needed to overcome the system-level design complexity. This type of design implies several stages of modeling and optimization through synthesis and refinement.



In this context, the global objective of this project is to contribute to the definition of system-level design methodology and tools for the next generation of heterogeneous systems enabled by the functional diversification on chip or in package. The projects will emphasis the global view of these systems to render possible the design space exploration through the different stages of the design process. The key issues are the definition of abstractions, clean models and refinements for the different components and for the interfaces between the heterogeneous components. The efficiency of proposed approach will be evaluated using illustrative systems integrating photonic interconnects or networked smart systems.

"Existing search engines do not consider the particularity of the user. The same query from different users will be answered in the same way. In reality, users often expect different documents. In addition, queries are usually considered in isolation. In reality, there may be relationships between a new query and previous queries submitted by the same user or by different users. Therefore, the interactions of the users with the similar queries can also help better understand what the user expects with the new query.

"Physical vapor deposition (PVD) coatings can be strategically applied on relatively small stamping die inserts which are installed in the areas where severe wear may occur. This approach is most likely necessary because PVD coatings can have a much higher hardness and wear resistance than electroplated or electroless coatings and nitrided steels. Lab tests are usually used to evaluate the PVD coatings before actual production applications. Spallation is the main failure mechanism of PVD hard coatings in stamping applications, which can not be observed in lab tests conducted in operating conditions that do not correspond to actual productions. In the proposed research, pin-on-disc sliding wear tests, ball-on-plate impact fatigue tests, and extended impact fatigue tests with additional sliding motions under ultra high contact stress will be chosen as the accelerated lab tests to simulate the wear conditions of spallation failures.                   

    The objective of the proposed project is to have a better understanding of compositional gradient PVD coatings and coating failure behaviours so that the strategic use of PVD coatings will be one of the solutions in dealing with wear problems. In the project, i) PVD coatings with functional gradient mechanical properties will be prepared using an emerging high-power pulsed magnetron sputtering (HPPMS) technology; ii) accelerated tests with testing conditions similar to actual stresses in productions will be used to determine spallation behaviours for various combinations of different coatings with different die substrate materials; and iii) the effects of coating composition gradient and substrate surface finish on the coating failures will be investigated. After completion of these fundamental studies, recommendation on selections of coating and substrate materials and methods of substrate surface preparation will be made for industrial tests and applications. The research will create new knowledge in the areas of materials, coatings, surface engineering, and manufacturing, also lead to the development of new collaborative research projects with Canadian automakers and die/mould makers in the future, and greatly enhance HQP training as well.

"The set stabilization problem is an important problem in control systems because there are many emerging applications in which set stabilization is the natural way to formulate control objectives. Some examples are the control of a formation to make three wheeled robots arrange themselves in a triangle on the plane; the control of the walking motion for a biped robot; the path following problem for a car, ship or airplane (make the position of the mobile vehicle approach and follow a path); the creation of virtual constraints in a robot for haptic applications; the synchronization of coupled oscillators. Theoretically, many existing concepts from nonlinear control that deal with equilibria stabilization have analogous counterparts in the set stabilization realm which would represent a fundamental generalization and contribution to control theory.



This proposal focuses on (a) computational aspects of the set stabilization problem, (b) application to coordinated path following, and (c) implementation of coordinated path following algorithms. Part (a) focuses on making set stabilization a more feasible and useful approach to control design. This entails creating a software toolbox for calculating the control laws and working on set stabilization using output feedback. Part (b) deals with the problem of getting a group of agents to each follow a path in a coordinated way while part (c) implements the theoretical development from (a) and (b).



It is becoming increasingly clear that the Canadian labour market is undergoing a major restructuring in light of the emergence of new economic powers. The pressure for increased productivity leads to a more automated society in which robotics and advanced control theory will play a major role.  The requirements that this will place on the engineering profession are vast and varied. Control theory and specifically advanced techniques from nonlinear control is one of the disciplines that will be relied upon to lead these changes.

"The main thrust of my research program lies in the development of a functional approach to point process models for the analysis of complex recurrent event data.  Recurrent event data refers to data collected over time of some repeating event of interest.  There may also be complicating factors, such as the data being partially missing, correlated, or clustered.  Here, in particular we consider spatially and temporally correlated data.  The functional approach is focused on the estimation of the underlying mechanisms generating the observed data, the rate at which some event of interest is occurring for instance.  Point processes are a flexible way of modeling events over space and time and my work is directed towards the creation of new methods of incorporating functional data approaches into the analysis of such processes to pose and test complex hypotheses for spatio-temporal studies.



The work is motivated by many practical problems and is not only important in the field of statistics but also in diverse scientific areas.  My two primary application areas are: 1) epidemiology, where investigators are interested in disease surveillance over health regions, and 2) environmental science, where there is interests in monitoring environmental and climatic changes, such as the migration patterns of the mountain pine beetle which is causing massive damage to Canada's forests.

"Carnivores maintain ecosystem function and biodiversity through top-down regulation of prey with cascading (indirect) effects to other trophic levels. Some carnivores, however, including grizzly bears and badgers, also directly alter ecosystem function and biodiversity through biopedturbation (disturbance of soil by an organism). Many of these species are typified by having large-area requirements and sensitivities to human disturbance making them candidate umbrellas for biodiversity conservation. In the Canadian Rockies, recent conservation and management emphasis has been placed on protecting large carnivores. How protection of umbrella species influences ecosystem function and biodiversity in alpine environments, especially in the presence of climate change, remains unclear. Over the next five years, my research will focus on: (1) Determining the importance of biopedturbation on maintaining ecosystem function and biodiversity in alpine meadows; (2) Test the effectiveness of using carnivores as an umbrella for biodiversity conservation; and (3) Investigate the use of occupancy-based vital rates for monitoring species recovery and documenting critical factors affecting their distribution. I will use grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and the Canadian Rocky Mountains as a model species and system to address these questions. One  PhD, two  MSc, and six summer research students will be trained. This research will contribute to our understanding of species-biodiversity interactions, implications of using umbrella species as conservation shortcuts, and more broadly to methods for monitoring species-at-risk in Canada.

"We live in an ever-changing world that is rich with objects and events. It is too complex to analyze it completely. So, how can we properly interact with it? I will investigate three fundamental strategies that the brain can use to cope with complexity. First, it can use prior knowledge to guide its attention and to select pieces of information that need to be processed first while ignoring others. Second, it can use optimal ways to integrate information in the best possible way. Third, it can use sparse coding, that is, it can convert the complexity of its sensory information about the world into simpler, categorical descriptions. I will explore the role of these strategies for two types of functions, when perceiving objects and when controlling manual actions towards them. Specifically, I will ask: (1) What are the neural correlates of prior knowledge and attention for object perception? (2) Can differences between perception and grasp actions be explained by differences in optimization? (3) Do processes of perception and action differ with regards to sparse coding as often observed in higher cognitive functions such as category learning? I expect that results from this research will further an understanding of mechanisms of object perception, of the functional architecture of visual processes, and the contributions of sensorimotor processes to human thought.

"Development of Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) tailored to harsh environment applications is a new and emerging area of research. The objective of the proposed research program is to develop new multifunctional MEMS sensors capable of operation in high temperature environments. To achieve this objective, the design and characterization of next generation sensors, appropriate fabrication methods, on-chip integration, and sensor packaging will be investigated.

     Many applications that require MEMS sensors take place in harsh environments - locations with high temperature, high radiation and intense vibration, to name a few. For example, in the automotive industry, to prevent rollover accidents linked to under-inflation of tires, small and robust multiple sensing units are needed to provide active tire-monitoring under high temperature and intense vibrations. In space exploration, small, simple and reliable sensor systems that do not need to reside in environmentally controlled areas will reduce the size and weight of satellites and rovers. Hence, robust and cost effective single-chip MEMS sensors that can reliably operate in harsh environments will replace the bulky and expensive sensor systems in use today.

     The proposed new multifunctional MEMS sensors will be fabricated on a single chip using materials that exhibit good mechanical and thermal stability at elevated temperatures, such as Silicon and/or Silicon Carbide (SiC) for the substrates, and Silicon Nitride and/or SiC thin films for the sensing elements. The chip will be packaged using a micro-capsule which will provide extra protection and result in further reduction in the size and overall weight of the sensor system. This project will lead to innovative concepts for multiple sensing and the development of new and/or better fabrication techniques for MEMS sensors tailored to harsh environments. It will also lead to breakthroughs in sensor reliability and lifetime, issues that are currently limiting the commercial use of MEMS sensors in general. Students who graduate from this program will have extensive hands-on experience in the development of MEMS and will be in great demand now and the foreseeable future.

"The broad aim of the proposed research is to carry out experiments designed to understand the role played by the lattice defects in determining the properties and behaviour of crystalline materials subjected to cyclic loading i.e. fatigue deformation. Funding is requested to study fatigue behaviour of nano-grain copper over a range of temperatures between -269 degree Celsius to room temperature. The experiments will provide data pertaining to the lattice defects produced during fatigue deformation, the stability of these defects under different cyclic conditions and the nature of damage processes which lead to failure. 

This data will be linked to Molecular Dynamic studies of dislocation interactions with different elements of material substructure at the atomic level to identify fundamental mechanism responsible for the strength, ductility and the plasticity limits of nano-material systems. This knowledge will help to develop a better understanding of the relationship between mechanical properties and the microstructure in ultra-fine grain materials and can help to design materials that will meet the challenges created by cyclic deformation and extreme temperatures.","Materials sciences","McMaster University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Structure, propri�t�s et essais des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"

For example, the growth and behaviour of bone cells in the body is crucial to our health, and understanding the effect of hormones and  drugs on these cells is important. Another example are nanoelectronic devices: the technology behind nanodevices is pushing physical limits, and understanding their behaviour is both important and challenging. In each of these cases, the physical situation is quite  complex, and experiments to understand these are expensive and time-consuming.

"Marek's disease virus (MDV) causes Marek's disease (MD), a lymphoma of poultry.  MDV is globally ubiquitous, thus almost all commercial chickens are vaccinated with the MD vaccine. Incidence of MD in unvaccinated chicken flocks can be as high as 20-30 %; this was commonly observed before the introduction of MD vaccines in the early 1970's. The MD vaccine is unusual in that it does not prevent virulent MDV infection, but rather the vaccine virus prevents tumor formation while co-existing with the virulent virus in the host. The mechanism by which this occurs is not well understood. MD tumor cells harbor the MDV genome, which means the tumor cells are infected with virus. Since MD tumor cells are not killed by the MDV infection, they must be infected latently. Otherwise MDV kills the lytically infected cells. It is very difficult to detect these latently infected cells as MDV makes only a few virus specific proteins and RNAs during latency. However, it is essential to know the dynamics of both lytic and latent infection in order to understand the pathogenesis and vaccination mechanisms in MD. 

  This proposal strives to reveal the replication dynamics of MDV in infected birds by tagging MDV-infected cells with fluorescent proteins (FPs) that will be used to reveal the relationship between MDV replication dynamics in the body and MD pathogenesis. By carefully selecting the promoters combined with the precise genome modification technology, we will insert FP genes into the MDV genome so that the FPs are expressed in both lytically and latently infected cells in the animal body. By tracking the FP-tagged infected cells, the virus replication dynamics will be easily followed in a bird. Based on this powerful system, we will test the hypothesis that the MD vaccine prevents tumors by reducing the number of latently infected cells.

"I do research in two areas, adaptive control systems and fluid power control systems. Adaptive control systems are used where the device, plant or system that is to be controlled has characteristics that are largely unknown or that vary widely with time or environmental changes. Such characteristics are typical of the aircraft and aerospace fields and are found in many industrial situations. Special techniques are required to provide satisfactory control in such cases. Relevant studies include the development of techniques for identifying the unknown characteristics, and systems which are able to adapt themselves to the changes which these characteristics undergo. These studies have included, and still include, the development and application of adaptive observers, model reference systems, fuzzy and neural network controllers, and the stability of the resulting systems. Fluid power control involves the use of high pressure electrohydraulic control systems which are required where large loads are to be controlled and the responses must be fast. The development of high performance hydraulic components such as electrohydraulic valves and pumps, the development of special techniques such as pulse-width modulation, and the application of model reference techniques, fuzzy sets and neural networks to these systems have been, or are, amongst the work carried out. In particular, research during the next few years will center on the control of flexible manipulators and the development of fault simulators for hydraulic components and systems.",Engineering,"University of Saskatchewan",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie m�canique","G�nie m�canique"

"THE OBJECTIVE of this proposal is to establish a feasible framework for the solution of the inverse problems arising in microwave imaging. The focus is on applications for microwave breast tumor detection although the developed approaches will have wider applicability. A feasible system must be reliable (ensuring repeatability and accuracy of both data acquisition and image reconstruction), efficient (providing answers in a reasonable amount of time), practical (measurement apparatus is readily available, system has some mobility), safe, and relatively inexpensive (e.g., compared to X-ray mammography).

  Microwave imaging techniques have emerged as promising alternative or complementary diagnostic tools to X-ray, ultrasound and other modalities in medical diagnostics and industrial non-destructive testing. While being under intense study, the current approaches suffer from a number of significant problems preventing applications in practice. The major concern is the prediction reliability, e.g., in early breat-cancer detection or in structural integrity inspection. 

  In this project, we aim at the development of a novel approach, which exploits the best features of the two major methodologies put forward so far by the microwave-imaging community: ultrawideband (UWB) radar and microwave tomography. Our approach has become possible due to two very recent technologies developed and refined by our team: (i) the system sensitivity analysis and (ii) the photographic 3-D image interface based on photogrammetry. In brief, we envision a microwave imaging methodology where the initial guess to the solution of the inverse problem is obtained by techniques akin to those used in UWB radar. The initial estimate is then passed on to an iterative solution, which is accelerated by the response Jacobians. The model-aided solution will rely on accurate electromagnetic simulations where the exact shape of the surface of the examined object (e.g., the breast) is supplied by the photogrammetry imaging interface. The final solution will provide a high-resolution permittivity image of the suspect regions, which will allow for a reliable diagnosis.","Biomedical engineering","McMaster University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","�lectromagn�tisme","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"

"Transition metal hydrides, compounds with a metal-hydrogen bond, are indispensable in chemistry due to their relevance to the whole range of catalytic industrial hydride transfer processes, including the production of both commodity chemicals and fine chemicals, and in laboratory applications to make a large range of derivatives. Whereas industrial catalysts are primarily heterogeneous with a poorly defined nature of reactive intermediates, laboratory homogeneous catalysts feature very well-defined reactive sites (usually based on one, two or few metal centres) supported by ancillary groups of controllable electronic and steric properties. Until very recently, the vast majority of established hydride complexes were based solely on the abundant phosphine, carbonyl, and polyolefin ligand environments, while relatively little is known about the reactivity of hydride complexes supported by new generations of nitrogen-based ligands. Such new ligands and ligand combinations are now well established, but almost exclusively in the narrow context of homogeneous olefin polymerization catalysis. 

Another significant venue of research in hydride chemistry is focused on understanding the nature of bond rupture/formation processes in the coordination sphere of metals during catalysis. To this end, the isolation and study of complexes with ""frozen"" interligand interactions is extremely important. The hydride compounds were the domain in which the phenomenon of nonclassical interligand bonding was discovered, first, in dihydrogen complexes and in CH-agostic complexes and, second, in other sigma-complexes. This allowed scientists, for the first time, to model the key steps in the metal-mediated transformations of small molecules. In particular, our group pioneered the investigations of interligand hypervalent interactions and discovered new families of complexes featuring stretched beta-Si-H agostic interactions. 

The fundamental aim of this project is to prepare and study new types of potentially catalytically active transition metal hydride complexes and understand their activity through the study of complexes with ""frozen"" nonclassical interligand interactions.","Physical sciences","Brock University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Chimie m�tallique et organo-m�tallique","Chimie inorganique"

"The pineal gland in mammals including humans, produces a chemical messenger or hormone called melatonin,

which exhibits very low daytime levels, with peak levels present in the circulation at night. This hormone plays

an important role in the regulation of circadian rhythms by interacting with the biological clock in the brain. It

is also involved in modulating other brain activity, endocrine function, immune responses and reproductive

activity. There is increasing evidence that melatonin can exert anticancer effects and it has been shown to

inhibit the growth of human breast tumours.

In addition, recent studies indicate that melatonin is a neuroprotective hormone which protects brain cells

against the injurious effects of free radicals, environmental neurotoxins and other hazardous substances. In

order to produce these effects, melatonin travels in the bloodstream to reach the brain and other organs, where

it binds to specific sites or receptors on target cells. Melatonin binding conveys a signal to these cells, which

results in a cascade of cellular responses, with consequent changes in the functional activity of the target organ.

Importantly, older individuals exhibit a significant decrease in the nocturnal levels of this protective hormone,

which is thought to be related to the progressive age-related onset of neurodegenerative disorders such as

Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's and other diseases including cancer.

Genetic studies have identified two distinct receptors for melatonin in humans and other mammals. This

proposal is aimed at clarifying how melatonin receptors are regulated by drugs or other agents and how this

affects the biological effects of this hormone. This information will advance our understanding of the diverse

physiological or functional roles of melatonin. Ultimately, it will be possible to utilize rational physiological

approaches to harness and maintain the widespread benefits of this protective hormone, in treating or

preventing various pathological conditions including neurodegeneration and cancer.","Advancement of knowledge","McMaster University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Biochimie,Biochimie
"The aim of my research program is to understand how structures with different form and function arise as an organism develops.  For example, an initially uniform sheet of cells, or epithelium, can take on a complex form as its individual cells change their shapes or undergo various movements.  We use the ovary of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a simple experimental system for understanding what molecules inside the cell carry out these cellular behaviors.  The follicular epithelium of the ovary, which surrounds each developing egg, starts out as a uniform sheet but, over time, two groups of cells in the tissue undergo a series of shape changes, creating folds in the tissue that go on to form two tubes of cells that project from the flat sheet.  

   We have identified a gene, named echinoid (ed), that appears to help generate these tubes by coordinating the cell shape changes that first create the folds.  The structure of the Ed protein suggests that it is normally located on the surface of cells and our work suggests that Ed helps cells recognize and interact with each other.  Interestingly, when cells with Ed are adjacent to cells without Ed, changes in the skeleton of the cell result and drive the changes in cell shape that complete tube formation.  We will now determine how the interface between cells with and without Ed causes this phenomenon, and which molecules Ed interacts with to generate this cellular behaviour.  In addition to our studies of Ed, we are developing a new technique for identifying other genes that function in shaping tissues.  Finding new genes involved will enhance our understanding of how these processes work.

   Our findings in this simple system will increase our knowledge of similar cellular processes are observed in humans, where epithelia undergo similar movements to generate the tubular networks of the kidney, lung and mammary gland.  These cellular behaviors are also observed in wound healing.  Since most Drosophila genes have human equivalents, insight into the genes that control how cell interact with each other, and how these interactions shape tissues, will further our understanding of both normal and abnormal human development.

"    )	    )	This research proposes to study solid-liquid mass transfer applications employing electrochemical and simultaneous electrochemical and ion-exchange and/or liquid-liquid extraction (solvent extraction) techniques for removal of metals from industrial process and waste liquids.



    )	The novel aspect of the proposed electrolytic studies will be in the use of unique electrode designs with high specific surface area and unique means of promoting turbulence to achieve enhanced production rates. The research will have both economic and environmental significance because it will be done for systems of commercial importance for recovery of valuable metals and removal of toxic and hazardous substances from wastewater and industrial effluents. The electrodepositions will be first studied using synthetic metal ion solutions and then tested on industrial process solutions and effluents. Studies will also be done on a unique concept, i.e., combining electrodepositions with ion exchange and solvent extraction, respectively, to achieve enhanced efficiency of metal removal from very dilute solutions such as wastewater and electrolytic bath rinse solutions from the metal finishing and electroplating industries. Simultaneous electrodeposition and solvent extraction will also have the added economic benefit of combining the stripping and electrolysis operations of the solvent extraction process into one operation and thus saving a unit operation and an expensive piece of equipment.  

   

    )	In addition, a very timely application of electrochemical technique of significant benefit to Canada, the electro-coagulation, will be studied to separate oil from water from emulsions resulting from oil spills, etc., as also the reclamation of water from Alberta's oil sands tailings for recycle to economize on the high demand of water in bitumen recovery. The research therefore will lead to economic and environmental benefits.

"The idea of structuring information is at the heart of computational problems in diverse application areas such as social sciences, artificial intelligence, biology, Web computing, and many other areas.  There may be restrictions in the way that information can be structured, either due to the types of inputs to the problems (the types of information on which the problem is being solved) or due to the type of solution being sought.  The goal of my research program is to determine ways of characterizing structure that allows for efficient solutions to fundamental problems; these in turn can be applied to specific problems in target areas.  My interests range from extracting structure from problems to developing characterizations and associated solutions, especially for fundamental problems of broad applicability across areas.

     One type of problem is to reconstruct information given one or more collections of possibly faulty measurements.  It is also possible to determine the similarity between two data sets by determining if one appears as a substructure of another, either once or multiple times, exactly or otherwise.  These problems can be approached in different ways depending on what similarity measures are used.  In some cases, it is also interesting to be able to determine the number of solutions possible.

     Whereas many problems are stated for one fixed point in time, it may be the case that there are slight changes over time, necessitating modifications to the solution.  I am interested in situations in which the new solution is faster to find by using the previous solution than by starting the computation all over again.  In particular, I am using as a parameter the amount of drift possible, and looking at problems for which it is difficult, in general, to find solutions that can be computed in time polynomial in the size of the input.   I hope to find solutions that are polynomial in the size of the input but possibly a larger function with respect to the parameter; this would yield practical results for situations in which the amount of drift (and hence the parameter) might be small.

"Mass spectrometry is the most valuable technique available to rapidly characterize novel peptides, proteins, and polymers.  Currently, in the chemistry department at the University of Toronto our Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Mass Spectrometer (MALDI-MS) is heavily used by graduate students from my laboratory as well as from other laboratories.  It is the only MALDI-MS instrument that is student run at the University of Toronto.  Our MALDI-MS instrument provides an excellent tool for the training of highly qualified personnel and for carrying out innovative research in a timely fashion.  The MALDI-MS laser upgrade requested here essential to keeping this instrument running.

     The research carried out in the Nitz and Woolley labs is heavily dependent on the synthesis and characterization of peptides, carbohydrates and proteins containing novel functionalities.  In the Nitz lab these macromolecules are important steps towards understanding the roles of the carbohydrates, how bacteria form biofilms and how enzymes process polysaccharides. In the Woolley lab the macromolecules synthesized form the basis of methods to control cellular function with light.  Due to the large size of the macromolecules studied in our labs we require readily access to a mass spectrometer to carry out innovative science.  

     Our MALDI-MS instrument has proven itself as a robust instrument on which students can readily obtain high quality data.  The instruments laser is now nearing the end of its useful life as can be seen with the decrease in usable data we are able to obtain. To maintain utility of the MALDI-MS we request a new laser and the installation costs for this upgrade.

"Heparan sulfate (HS) is a linear polysaccharide that is ubiquitous in complex organisms.  It is found in the space between cells and is proposed to orchestrate many biological events that coordinate organismal development and maintenance.  HS has also been found to be a key player in many human diseases ranging from cancer to bacterial and viral infections. Despite the wide spread presence and importance of HS, very few tools are available to study its overall structure. Our research program is focused on developing new tools and techniques to facilitate HS research. We aim to generate conjugates that mimic the structure of HS.  We will test the ability of these compounds to interact with a variety of HS binding proteins important in immune function.  Understanding how these HS mimics function and comparing the findings to to those observed with the natural HS polymer will lead to a better understanding of HS and how diseases which involve HS may be controlled.  We also aim to prepare fluorescent sensors able to report on the macromolecular structure of HS.  Being able to follow changes in the structure of HS will lead to important findings as to how HS regulates biological function.  

     HS mimics will be synthesized by developing novel chemistry that allows fragments of heparin to be polymerized into defined structures.  Heparin fragments which contain unique functional groups at either termini can be generated using commercially available bacterial lyase enzymes.  

     Fluorescent sensors of heparan structure will be designed based on the successful heparin sensors developed in our laboratory.  Using a versatile quinolinium fluorophore, a set of molecular rulers will be developed that can be used to measure the number and the distance between the protein binding domains in HS.  This knowledge is critical to understanding how HS organizes and allows for signaling between proteins at the cell surface.

"Blade vibration and noise generation are both undesirable consequences of the unsteady flow processes that occur within an axial-flow turbomachines and are, therefore, important concerns of the designer. Of the two, vibration problems have received more attention because they can lead to a structural failure of the engine and, possibly, to extensive damages including life losses. Aerodynamically-induced blade vibrations are usually classified into two general categories: self-sustained and forced problems. In the former, the aerodynamic forces that sustain the blade motion are regarded as being dependent solely on that motion (e.g. in flutter), whereas in the latter, the aerodynamic forces that excite the blade motion are independent of that motion (e.g. in buffeting and blade mistuning). This research will be more focused in the latter class of problems. The development of new integrated rotor-blade designs (BLISKS) led to renewed concerns about vibration-related problems because the natural structural damping due to the traditional blade attachments is now absent. Therefore, control systems for the interrogation of the structural integrity of turbomachines and/or reduction of vibration using ""smart"" structures actuators and sensors such as piezoelectrics are a matter of research effort. The actuator device nicknamed Smart Spring is best suited to be used to actively alter the boundary conditions of structures using friction and, as such, they may be incorporated to BLISKS to provide theur artificial damping augmentation. In the current application this approach will be taken to attenuate the forced-vibration problems most commonly encountered in turbine and compressor stages of turbomachineries. This objective will require the use of complex Computational Fluid Dynamic models that must be linked to structural control idealizations for the numerical simulations. For this, reduced-order aeroelastic models of cascade flows including unsteady aerodynamic effects, blade inter-phase angles and mistuning will be firstly developed using reduced-order aeroelastic models for the sake of computation efficiency.

"Knowledge acquisition has always been the major bottleneck for knowledge-based systems (KBS). This is especially true for Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) in which knowledge base includes domain ontology and problem solving knowledge.  In order for ITSs to thrive in fields where knowledge evolves rapidly, such as business and industrial settings, new, easy-to-use tools must be developed for knowledge acquisition and maintenance. The first knowledge creation problem finds its source in the fact that the knowledge base usually has to be created manually, from scratch. However, crucial information already exists, hidden in legions of existing documents and databases within communities and organizations. Domain expert are required to make it explicit and provide relevant knowledge to the artificial tutor so that it will be able to guide the learner through competence and problem solving skills development. However, in several domains, problem solving knowledge is not easy to predetermine and it evolves. 



To find more efficient solutions to these problems, I propose to investigate Knowledge Discovery (KD) techniques to build domain intelligence within an ITS.  First, this project will produce some KD techniques that can support new domain knowledge discovery and ontology evolution in dynamic domains by mining documents flowing in the context where learning will take place. Second, I am interested in the automatic learning of task models from users' action traces to extract new procedures (correct or incorrect), new problem spaces and new problem solving strategies. We know how time-consuming are both the cognitive task analysis and rules authoring process aimed at producing effective problem spaces or task models to support valuable tutoring services such as model and knowledge tracing, coaching, error detection and plan recognition. Current authoring systems fail to simplify these processes. This project offers a great opportunity to overcome those two main stumbling blocks of knowledge acquisition in ITS.

"This proposal deals with three areas and all revolve around optimal inference in switching models and generalized inference. First, I will consider an inference problem in some regime switching stochastic processes such as the process of the interest rate structure. For many cases, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) does not have a closed form and thus, much progress is to be made in the asymptotic properties of the suggested MLE. I plan to study the asymptotic properties of the MLEs and to investigate some alternative methods which are based for example on quasi-likelihood technique. Further, I will explore extensions to multiple multivariate stochastic processes with regime switching when the components of the parameter matrix are suspected to lie in a special hyper-plan. Further, as in Nkurunziza and Ahmed (2008), I will improve classical MLE by pretest and shrinkage estimators. Second, I consider inference problems for the parameters of k time-varying deterministic systems of differential equations (ODEs) which describe the dynamic of k pairs of prey-predator populations as for example time-varying Lotka-Volterra and Holling-Tanner ODEs. Interestingly, by such time varying coefficients, the model account for the animal adaptation factor, the hiding strategy and seasonal effects. In this project, I will also study the case where the error noise structure is more general than that considered in Froda and Nkurunziza (2007) along with regime switching, and I hope to improve the previous methods by using shrinkage and pretest strategies. Finally, some classical inference problems are to be revisited through generalized inference that is proved to give satisfactory results for a variety of complex problems such as Behrens-Fisher problem. I plan on extending the research work in Nkurunziza and Chen (2008), and in Nkurunziza, Quazi and Fung (2008) where the generalized inference is studied through the invariance principle, and applied to some linear models. Namely, I will consider the case of a regime-switching linear models with heteroscedastic error terms and/or the case of exogenous stochastic variables. Finally, I will investigate an alternative of Chow test for testing the regime change.

"Increasingly, large-scale flow structures have been identified as a source of interest in a wide variety of flows.  The scale of structures that are highlighted here is on the order of, or larger than, the local length scales in the flow, and may be such phenomena as large-scale flapping / movement of jets, large vortices, general flow oscillation, re-circulation zones and the preferential path taken by fluid (short-circuiting).  These large-scale coherent phenomena are sometimes chaotic in motion, are generally three-dimensional in nature, and can be difficult to identify in the mean flow field.  In industry, the presence of these flow phenomena can lead to noise generation, vibration, and reduction in performance.  A remedial design solution is often required to address these problems and bring the system close to design performance



This research program will develop design procedures that address large-scale motion within confined geometries typical of those found in industry.  Investigation of specific cases will lead to development of generic design solutions.  Fundamental understanding of the effect of large-scale flow motion will lead to improvement in process performance and potentially new technology.



A staged approach to the research will be taken and this will be used to highlight short and long term objectives.  Specific, individual problems related to large-scale phenomenon in confined flows will be investigated.  From these, design information for generic sets of flow problems will be identified.  This will lead to the development of design standards and approaches that can be used in the designing of confined mixing and separation vessels for industry.  The culmination of the work will be fundamental understand of the effect of large-scale motion and oscillations in fluid mechanics.

SNOLAB experiments aim to determine the properties of the elusive neutrinos,  and probe how they fit in the standard model of particle physics. Other experiments will search for dark matter. It is now clear that 95% of the content of the Universe is in forms completely unknown to us. Dark matter may exist as massive particles, left over relics from the big-bang. Neutrinos can also be used as a probe into the inner workings of the earth. By observing neutrinos from radioactive decay in the earth, we can learn something of the poorly understood heat production processes. In addition to astroparticle physics pursuits, the facility can support other research programs. Two current examples are seismicity research far away from the earth's surface where reflections can disturb the signals and a feasibility study for a precise measurement of the gravitational constant. 

    SNOLAB will build on the success of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) and will allow Canadian physicists to remain at the forefront of the field of astroparticle physics. SNOLAB will be the deepest and cleanest facility on the planet when it becomes operational. It will be staffed by a highly experienced technical staff accustomed to working on complex detectors deep underground in a clean-room environment. This grant will support the salaries of SNOLAB personnel and the operational costs of the laboratory. It does not intend to support the direct costs of the experiments.

"The objective of the proposed research program is to develop methods for automated interpretation of spectral image data from plants and scenes of plants.  This includes determining the structure, species composition, and health of a plant canopy.  Spectral images of the scenes are collected using spectral imaging equipment.  These instruments provide detailed spectral and spatial information, allowing subtle differences and relationships in pigmentation, structure, and surface characteristics to be observed and used.  It is also possible to use light outside of the range visible to people.  Based on prior spectral work, this project proposes to use the ultraviolet spectrum in addition to the visible and very-near infrared.  This will be a unique contribution to the state of the art in this field, and imaging more generally.



Two particular aspects of interpreting complex biological scenes will be studied: species identification, and using the directional dependencies of reflectance to reconstruct canopy structure.  Species identification will be accomplished by developing techniques to quantify definable characteristics about species in ways that do not require direct comparison to other species.  Directional dependency effects will be studied using customised equipment that will enable spectral image data to be acquired from multiple angles around a plant while simultaneously scanning a profile of the plant.  These data will assist in scene segmentation tasks by recognizing areas with similar orientation, and allowing for some canopy geometry information to be inferred.



The ability to automatically interpret visual information about complex biological scenes has been identified as a priority for specialty crop production. Application examples include vision systems for greenhouse automation, crop scouting (for disease, weeds, insects, and plant health), and reducing agricultural chemical inputs.",Agriculture,"University of Saskatchewan",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie rural","G�nie rural"

"Behavioural sensitization is defined as a progressive increase in a drug's behavioural effects after repeated exposure.  It occurs with a number of drugs, including amphetamine, cocaine, stimulants, opioids, and alcohol.  Sensitization is thought to be an important factor in drug addiction and relapse, and compulsive behaviours.  In more general terms, sensitization is a model of enduring behavioural plasticity, since one of its remarkable properties is its prolonged persistence beyond cessation of exposure to the inducing stimulus.  For these reasons considerable attention has been focused on the nature of the underlying neuroadaptations mediating sensitization.  Current consensus firmly implicates brain dopamine (DA) systems in sensitization phenomena.  However, the precise nature and role of dopaminergic mechanisms remains incompletely specified, as other neuroadaptations have been implicated in the process. The goal of this project is to elucidate relationships between changes in DA levels and DA receptors and other neuroadaptations potentially capable of sustaining sensitization phenomena, including alterations in neurotrophic factors and neurogenesis.  Our behavioural model of ethanol sensitization in mice allows us to separate animals that are vulnerable from those that are resistant to sensitization, which provides a convenient paradigm for distinguishing brain effects that are general effects of the inducing drugs from those brain effects that are uniquely associated with sensitization.  In separate studies, we shall test the hypothesis that transgenic mice lacking specific receptors have higher DA levels than normal controls, and/or release more DA in response to ethanol.  In separate experiments we will extend this hypothesis to normal mice showing resistance to ethanol sensitization.  We shall assess the status of DA systems by immunohistochemistry and HPLC measurements, microdialysis and ex vivo receptor occupancy.  In separate studies we will compare mice showing high vs. low propensity towards ethanol sensitization in terms of expression of BDNF and its TrkB receptor, intracellular markers such as pCREB and pDARPP-32 in selected brain areas.

"When we observe a house that is occupied, we may generally assume that the house is habitable.  Our assessment of the house may be improved if we see that a happy family lives inside.  Either of these cues is a shortcut to determining the quality of the house, without actually trying it out for ourselves.  It turns out that animals assess habitats in the same way.  This behaviour is under such strong selection that previous experiments have shown birds will occupy unsuitable habitats (akin to parking lots for humans) if they observe others there.  

     Consider that climate change is rapidly altering habitat (particularly in the north).  How will animals deal with this?  Will they try to settle these 'new' habitats?  On what basis will they assess habitat quality?  My students and I are attempting to answer these questions by conducting experiments to test whether animals will use social cues as a method of habitat selection.  Our first step is to examine which species seem to use social information, and to do this we are using decoys and sound playbacks to initiate settlement in unoccupied areas.  Once these areas are settled, we monitor the consequences of that habitat choice by investigating their movement patterns (using radio telemetry), diet, and reproductive success.

     This research can be easily applied as the results will serve to estimate the value of social attraction as a large-scale conservation measure. Once we better understand the tools available to animals to cope with large-scale habitat alteration, we can adapt management approaches to capitalize upon these behaviours to preserve, or enhance, biodiversity. This is an exciting avenue for study, as the majority of research attention is focused on the effects of climate change on wildlife, not on ways to construct proactive measures to aid population persistence.

"Streptomyces coelicolor is a superb experimental model for a large family of spore-forming and antibiotic-producing bacteria. Unlike simpler bacteria, the streptomycetes grow in via defined a life cycle that is similar to those of many eukaryotic fungi. This commences with spore germination and the generation of filamentous substrate hyphae. These grow by elongating and branching to produce a substrate mycelium. After 1-2 days a second cell type, the aerial hyphae, appears on the surface of the substrate mycelium, grows up into the air and metamorphoses into spores. While spore formation is taking place in the aerial hyphae, the substrate hyphae produce antibiotics such that the next generation (the spores) is protected from predators. Most currently employed antibiotics are produced by the streptomycetes. My NSERC-funded work is aimed at understanding the differentiation of the substrate and aerial hyphae. In the process we intend to solve the mechanism of action of a novel family of proteins.

          The bldB and abaA genes are important for aerial hyphae formation and antibiotic production.  The products of these genes are small acidic proteins of unknown function. We showed that BldB and AbaA are dimers and identified 7 amino acids residues in BldB that are likely involved in important protein-protein interactions - most of these are conserved in AbaA. While bldB is an isolated, monocistronic gene, abaA is clustered with two other genes that are also found adjacent to some other members of the bldB/abaA family. These other genes have not been investigated to date.

        Our aims are to identify the protein targets of BldB and AbaA and understand how they work. We will determine the roles of the genes that are adjacent to abaA using gene knock out technology. We will also solve the BldB and/or AbaA structure in collaboration with Dr. Guiseppe Melacini. In parallel, we will use genetic and biochemical analysis to understand the regulation of bldB transcription. Our overall goal is a complete molecular and genetic understanding of the mechanism of action of this novel protein family.

"Carbon nanotubes are new materials that have attracted significant attention over the past decade due to their outstanding electronic and mechanical properties. In particular, these nanomaterials have very promising properties as electron sources. Such electron sources are needed in ultra-high resolution microscopes, flat-panel displays and a number of innovative electronic device applications.



Several reasons make nanotubes attractive candidates for electron sources: 1) These tubes have a diameter of about one-millionth of a millimeter, but can be very long. This sharp geometry favors the electron emission process. 2) These materials are very strong and therefore can provide a very stable emitter with a long lifetime. 3) Due to the small diameter, quantum-mechanical effects play a major role and create exciting opportunities for improved performance.



In this project, we will systematically investigate various electron emission mechanisms from carbon nanotubes. These will involve the extraction of electrons by the application of an electric field, by use of another ""primary"" electron beam, or by excitation using a light beam. In order to accomplish this, we will make special structures using nanofabrication processes and grow nanotubes on them by means of a process called chemical vapor deposition. Electron emission experiments will be performed in a high-vacuum chamber to prevent the scattering of the generated electrons by air molecules and the deterioration of the samples.



In addition to the applications described above, this research will also have a long-term impact by exploring novel electronic devices and contributing to our knowledge of nanotechnology and physical phenomena at small scales.

"The long-term durability of concrete infrastructure is highly dependant on its mixture design and subsequent handling and placement. However, rarely is concrete tested in the field to determine its adherence to specifications especially when they contain requirements for durability. Most commonly specified performance-based durability tests are conducted under standard laboratory conditions. However, the major drawback to most of these methods is that they are performed on concrete specimens 14 to 56 days after casting. In addition, these specimens may be prepared on-site, but are frequently relocated to a laboratory after casting. These relatively small specimens are subjected to different placement and curing techniques as well as a different temperature history. The program will investigate various techniques for their potential applicability for field-testing of durability as well as to assess their sensitivity to factors encountered on site (poor curing, poor compaction). The novelty of this program is that concrete will be tested for durability in the field conditions rather than in a laboratory environment. Ideally, the testing should be performed well before 28 days as tight construction schedules typically necessitate pouring large volumes of concrete in a short time period. Previous work by the applicant indicated that the majority of the changes occur in the first 7 days after casting. By testing as early as possible, any potential defects can be found quickly and corrective action taken. Durable concrete infrastructure is important to the Canadian economy as repair and replacement costs are significant as well as the associated decreases in productivity. In addition, the program will test existing structures to determine adherence to specifications and the likelihood of potential premature failure. The program results are expected to change the manner in which concrete is tested. By testing field concrete rather than standard lab specimens, project owners and engineers will have a more realistic indication of the expected long-term performance of the concrete structure. In turn, by becoming involved with monitoring site performance, contractors will become invested in the process of constructing a durable end product.

"The Ganaraska Forest is the largest single tract of forest cover in the settled landscape of southern Ontario. As such, it is a major refuge for forest trees and the associated avifauna, including some rapidly declining aerial insectivores. The region contains greater avian biodiversity than any other region in southcentral Ontario. Since 1970, the forest has experienced significantly less snow as a proportion of total precipitation, a strong signal of the effects of climate warming. We hypothesize that this decline in snow cover will impact soil moisture, a key regulating factor of forest biodiversity. We propose to investigate causes of variation in soil moisture among different forest stands and at different slope positions, and how that variation relates to nutrient availability for vegetation, and insect and avian biodiversity and productivity. We propose to test the strength of connecting links between precipitation inputs, soil moisture, soil nutrients, vegetation, insect prey and birds. If the

connecting links are strong then changes in the pattern of winter precipitation due to climate change will have cascading effects to the bird communities. If weak, this will reflect greater resiliency in the ecosystem to changes in precipitation patterns. The study is interdisciplinary with a hydrologist, soil scientist and avian ecologist as co-applicants. Two graduate students, an M.Sc. and a Ph.D., as well as 9 technicans/research assistants are proposed. Our final objective is to construct a predictive model that will allow us to identify the most productive forest types and slope positions for long-term persistence of the avian community and forest  sustainability.The model will use inputs from the field work and a range of values within those predicted for variation in the ratio of snow to total precipitation. This work will be useful for complying with the Crown Forest Sustainability Act of Ontario and has the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, a key regulator, as a supporting organization.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","Trent University",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","�cologie terrestre","�volution et �cologie"

"The primary goal of the research is the development and application of new computational methods in quantum chemistry that can help clarify longstanding questions concerning the intricate chemistry of transition metal compounds. These molecular systems, which are important in a wide range of chemical, material, and biological contexts, have largely defied accurate theoretical descriptions up to now, and new computational tools are required to understand their rich behaviour, and to predict their properties from first principles. Professor Nooijen is developing new methods that can accurately describe the chemistry of many interacting magnetic open-shell electrons, for large molecular systems, and including the effects of nuclei moving on multiple electronic surfaces, all of which may be important in transition metal chemistry. To create the quantum chemistry methods of the future, software tools are being developed that derive the lengthy equations entering the theory, and which subsequently produce the actual computer codes that run effectively on large scale parallel computers.

The methods to be developed are to be the state of the art in the world of quantum chemistry. They will allow calculations that address unsolved experimental questions, but even more importantly, these calculations will serve as a benchmarks for other, computationally cheaper, methodologies that upon suitable parameterization are more powerful to probe the unknown and to perform experiments in silico. This reflects a beautiful synergy in the computational sciences where a large variety of methods of varying accuracy and applicability is used to jointly address some of the intriguing puzzles that arise in the world of chemistry and biology.

"Dimethylsulphide (DMS) oxidation and its role in generating new aerosols that have the potential to influence cloud formation, persistence and albedo is a key area of study for climate research.  This is particularly true in the Arctic and at high latitudes as the surface oceans that ultimately generate atmospheric DMS are expected to experience more temperature variation than at the equator due to radiative forcing.   Higher DMS gradients in ocean surface waters as a result of changing in surface water temperatures are generally expected to increase DMS mixing ratios in the atmosphere but the dynamics of sea-air exchange are also factors that need to be considered.  Sea-air exchange of DMS typically increases with sea surface roughness and is expressed as an empirical function of wind speed and sea surface temperature.  However, ocean surface characteristics not related to roughness are postulated to promote sea-air exchange for compounds participating in new aerosol formation in the Arctic (Leck and Bigg, 2005).   Many studies use DMS measurements in surface waters to estimate DMS flux and a fixed branching ratio for methanesulphonic acid (MSA) to biogenic sulphate to assess the impact of DMS aerosol sulphate formation on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN).  New research shows such estimates may grossly under-represent sea to air DMS flux, and/or the DMS oxidation pathways forming sulphur dioxide and sulphate are underestimated at mid to high latitudes particularly during spring and summer.  In this study, the isotope characteristics of sulphate aerosols, sulphur dioxide, and MSA, products of DMS oxidation will be used to assess regional scale DMS flux and DMS oxidation pathways in the Arctic and over the North Pacific.  Trends in DMS oxidation will be assessed through a series of collaborative and independent field studies to provide quantitative estimates of DMS lifetime, its oxidation pathways, and its potential for forming new aerosol sulphate.",Environment,"University of Calgary",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Chimie atmosph�rique (y compris pollution atmosph�rique)","�tude de l'atmosph�re"

"Ultramafic rocks form a large part of the Earth accessible to water and are subject to hydration metamorphism, commonly at low pressure and temperature. Under appropriate physico-chemical conditions, this can lead to formation of serpentinites (rocks essentially composed of serpentine minerals such as chrysotile asbestos) in various tectonic settings. During serpentinization, a number of important reactions take place. Of particular interest are; 1) the generation of large amounts of hydrogen; 2) the increase in pH and lowering in dissolved silica with decreasing temperature of the fluids, which may induce calc-silicate alteration at the interface between silica-rich rocks and their ultramafic host; and 3) the formation of metallic ore deposits such as nickel. During serpentinization, conditions can become sufficiently reducing to stabilize iron-nickel alloys and native iron, and transform solid or dissolved forms of carbon into hydrocarbons. However, very few studies have attempted to correlate the mineral assemblages in serpentinites with the nature of the serpentinizing fluids. Under what conditions are fluids gas-like or liquid-like? Establishing the latter within the range of pressure and temperature conditions found within the Earth's crust is an essential first step to further evaluation of the generation of hydrocarbon gases, the hydrolysis of hydrocarbons and the mobility of ore metals. Detailed studies of the mineralogy and of fossil fluids that were trapped into minerals that grew during serpentinization episodes can provide clues to solving these outstanding issues and forms the body of this proposed research program. An understanding of the processes outlined above will provide the tools for evaluating the global abiogenic hydrocarbon budget to oceans, the efficiency of metal mass transfer for the formation of economic deposits, and the input of primary food source for bacterial organism in extreme environments.","Land, solid earth, seabeds and ocean floors","Universit� du Qu�bec � Montr�al",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Min�rologie, chimie des cristaux et cristallographie","Sciences de la terre"

"The proposal describes a broad program of nanoscale surface, interface and materials science with emphasis: i) on the coupling of quantitative mechanical and chemical properties at nanometer (nm) length scales in tribology and in soft and hard materials; ii) on the development of new methods of manipulating live cells and studying them with high temporal, spatial (10s of nm) and spectroscopic resolutions at sensitivities approaching single molecule detection, and iii) the study of the dynamics of the formation of water on metal surfaces. The nanotribology studies are focused on understanding the basic mechanisms of friction, lubrication and wear, and involve synchrotron-based XANES imaging, imaging nanoindation, and, most recently, unique new methods of measuring wear at the nm/hr rate. The nanoscale biology work involves creation of patterned, optically transparent  substrates contained within microfluidic channels in which labeled live cells can be temporarily immobilized/patterned for study by confocal and near field optical techniques after chosen chemical and physical perturbations, before release and replacement. The Discovery Grant component of my research program will therefore support research in several main areas: 1) the study of ultralow wear-rates of materials; study of the temperature dependence of mechanical properties of materials and antiwear films (nanoscale creep); development of much more sensitive (~ 10 pN) (force compensated probes for materials research using interferometric detection methods; 2) the development and application of the new force-compensated probes for force measurements and for use as platforms for optical and other probes for the study of trafficking of molecules at the membranes of live cells (single molecule; < 10exp-18 L volume sampling); patterning of surfaces within microfluidic channels for biocompatibility and bioactivity; 3) joint developments with Hepburn at UBC of techniques to probe the internal energy state of water produced by the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen on platinum surfaces.","Advancement of knowledge","University of Western Ontario",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Chimie des surfaces et des interfaces","Chimie physique"

"Robot manipulators generally consist of links connected by joints, either in an open-loop configuration (referred to as serial manipulators) or in a closed-loop configuration (referred to as parallel manipulators). It is also possible to have combinations of open-loop and closed-loop modules (hybrid layout). A robot manipulator is reliable if any failure/malfunction, which terminates the ability of robot to perform a required task, would not result in an unsafe system. It is safe if it causes no injury or damage to the operator, environment and itself and is fail-safe if the system can be stopped safely after a failure. A fault-tolerant manipulator can complete its task safely after any failures. With proper design, parallel manipulators can have high accuracy, stiffness, load capacity, and dynamic characteristics (e.g., high accelerations). Because of these advantages, the potential market for parallel manipulators has been expanding to areas such as high speed manipulation, material handling, motion platforms, machine tools, medical fields, planetary exploration and so on. Therefore, methodologies for the design of optimum, reliable, safe, fault tolerant and high performance parallel manipulators are essential. The development of such design and solution methodologies is the objective of the current research proposal. The design of manipulators will be optimized based on specific criteria by combining serial and parallel designs, taking into account the cost of manufacturing and operation, and utilizing standard components and modular designs. Modelling and analysis of these designs will be investigated. Different levels of redundancy, e.g., redundant component (such as joints) and redundant information (such as internal and/or external sensors), will be considered and methodologies for redundancy resolution will be explored. While working on these projects, the students will develop and/or hone technical knowledge, hands-on expertise and communication skills. Therefore, highly qualified engineers will be trained in the areas of robotics, design, modelling, analysis, simulation, calibration and diagnosis. This, in turn, will enhance Canada's competitiveness in the growing potential market of parallel devices for diverse applications.","Advancement of knowledge","Queen's University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie m�canique","G�nie m�canique"

"Prompt access to relevant clinical information is crucial when making healthcare decisions. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) promises better care by providing centralized access to different sources of data that make up the patient medical record. Such data includes the patient medical history, diagnostic reports from various care domains, images and other clinical data in electronic format. In addition to enabling timely access to relevant clinical information, EHR creates totally new opportunities for assisting in clinical tasks and for guiding medical decisions. As access to information originating from various sources is becoming possible, care decisions can be enhanced from information integration. Information integration aims to obtain a unified comprehensive view by integrating information that is extracted from data gathered at various sources. The extracted information needs to be semantically integrated, organized, and presented in order to help in the clinical investigations. On the other hand, with the EHR, the issue of data security has become increasingly important. Confidentiality needs to be ensured by controlling the access to personal health information as expressed by the patients' electronic consent. Within the framework of the proposed research program, we will explore a new access control framework based on the patients consent. We will also explore novel approaches for information integration, organization and presentation to help in information navigation. Furthermore, we will investigate innovative methods to identify and co-locate features from multi-modality images, such as X-rays and Magnetic Resonance Images, in order to assist in breast cancer assessment.","Biomedical engineering","�cole de technologie sup�rieure",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie biom�dical","G�nie biom�dical"

"Sand Production in the petroleum industry can simply be defined as the production of degraded rock around the well together with reservoir fluid. Estimates show that 70% of World petroleum reserves are in sand prone reservoirs and sanding issues cost the industry $billions every year. Therefore, reliable prediction of sanding is vital to increasing field profitability.

Despite efforts to improve the predictive tools, by and large, accuracy of the models has been inadequate for general field applications for one or more of the following reasons. (1) Some models only consider particular factors in the process of sanding. To bring about sanding, however, various factors including drawdown, depletion, water-cut, completion strategy, and well shut-in frequency work in tandem. (2) Continuum based theories are adopted in simulation of sanding which is inherently discontinuum. Spurious mesh dependency of the results is one outcome of such choice. (3) Sanding models must aim to quantify the severity of sanding to permit proper risk assessment of the events and methods while most models predict only the onset of sanding. 

The objective of the proposed research is to provide a practical and fundamentally sound method for predicting the severity of sanding under practical field conditions by integrating continuum and discontinuum approaches. Significant computational efficiency can be achieved by using this hybrid approach where discrete modeling is applied to only the regions comprised of sand grains while continuum approach is used elsewhere.  

In this research, the microstructure of random packing of grains will be characterized. A simulator package will be developed by coupling of PFC discontinuum and FLAC continuum codes developed by ITASCA. Physical modeling of sanding will be conducted and the model predictions will be validated by the experimental results. Arrangements are in place for acquisition of field data from the oil industry for use in validation of the model against field measurements. The employed techniques and assumptions will be refined in the validation process to improve reliability and practical applicability of the proposed approach.

"This proposal relates to petroleum wellbore phenomena including rock degradation, sand production, and hydraulic fracturing. The proposed research takes a comprehensive approach in understanding and quantifying these phenomena in conventional and heavy oil reservoirs by fundamental and applied research through physical and mathematical modeling.  Sand production in the petroleum industry is defined as the production of solid particles together with reservoir fluids. Estimates indicate 70% of the world oil reserves are in reservoir sandstones that are prone to producing sand at some time during their production life. Sand influx into the wellbore can increase the well productivity/injectivity. It also has negative aspects and, if massive, can lead to wellbore collapse. Therefore, reliable prediction of sanding, which is a focus of this proposal, is vital to optimizing wellbore operational conditions and increasing field profitability. Development of reliable sanding models is only possible if various influential phenomena are understood and captured through improved theories and techniques. This aspect is another focus of the proposed research and includes the formulation and implementation of a constitutive law that can capture the rock degradation process. The model will be enriched to avoid the effects of artificial conditions on the numerical results.

The proposed research also includes the development of a numerical model for reliable prediction of hydraulic fracture propagation in weak sandstone reservoirs. Sand production and hydraulic fracturing are two linked phenomena in injection wells. Ultimately, hydraulic fracture and sand production models will be integrated for injection well studies.

The developed prediction tools are to be validated against physical test results that are part of the research agenda. The validated tools will be used in the analysis of field-scale problems to develop calibrations necessary for scaling up laboratory sanding results to field conditions.

"In many jurisdictions across Canada, Water Resources Managers are attempting to develop accurate water budgets for watersheds at a variety of scales. Where these watersheds are underlain by shallow bedrock aquifers, the feasibility of using water budgeting methods primarily developed for sand and gravel aquifers has been found in error. Recent studies by our partners in the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, the Rideau Valley Conservation Authority, the Cataraqui Region Conservation Authority and the Quinte Region Conservation Authority for example have shown that the traditional methods for estimating groundwater recharge in porous media are potentially highly inaccurate in fractured bedrock. The consequence of inaccurate recharge estimates is dire, as we now depend on these to determine the impact of water abstraction (i.e for water bottling, industrial requirements, and municipal needs) on groundwater and surface water supplies, and to estimate the potential impacts of climate change. In the first study of its kind, we propose to develop new tools more specifically designed to accurately predict groundwater recharge in fractured bedrock aquifers at the local and watershed scales. The focus of the research will be on both field study and model development, taking advantage of previous work conducted in a 900 km2 watershed located in eastern Ontario. Our first step will be to determine how much water is actually recharged during the year in this setting. By understanding the recharge mechanisms we propose to develop a new numerical modeling approach, new geochemical methods and new hydraulic measurements for the improvement of recharge estimates in areas of shallow bedrock. We strongly believe that the results of this study will change the standard of engineering and scientific practice for estimating recharge and preventing overexploitation in these settings and will greatly benefit other regions in Canada where bedrock aquifers are utilized such as in southern British Columbia, Quebec, elsewhere in Ontario, and in Atlantic Canada.

"This project will address the thermalhydraulic phenomena of a Super Critical Water Reactor (SCWR) during hypothetical accidents involving depressurization of the reactor coolant system.  While the basic phenomena for this blowdown period for subcritical water conditions, such as critical break discharge and flashing behaviour have been extensively analyzed within the nuclear industry, very little analysis is available for reactors near or above the super critical pressure. This work will examine depressurization characteristics for near critical and supercritical systems taking into consideration the unique properties as the fluid transitions through the critical state.  Specialized thermalhydraulic codes such as AECL's CATHENA or RELAP will be used to predict the coolant behaviour and for comparison against other international computer codes and data.  The systems identified include simple pipe geometries (similar to those studies by Edwards for sub-critical water conditions), tank geometries (similar to the Marviken tests performed for subcritical conditions), and finally for constricted flow through small breaks (to capitalize on existing experimental data and experiments underway in China as part of GIF).  The high level objective of these comparisons is to ensure international agreement on depressurization behaviour between different computer codes and methods prior to such tools being used in further design activities.  In addition to this objective, this work will generate valuable knowledge and experience in the numerical predictions and stability of computer codes for application to SCWR design as well as generate 3 HQP in the area of nuclear thermalhydraulics and SCW.

"Nanofluids present a new and unique area of research for nuclear engineering as they can significantly improve heat transfer from nuclear fuel, thereby providing additional safety margins in existing designs, as well as influencing and possibly inhibiting erosion of carbon steel used in nuclear plant piping.  This research involves examination on nanoparticle applications to heat transfer systems and is related to reallocation exercise GSC 13-5.  Specifically the role of nanoparticles in buoyant and forced convective systems will be examined to determine the mechanisms involved in heat transfer improvement, and their possible development for application to nuclear reactors in order to improve heat transfer performance.

The Canadian government has recently signed collaborative framework agreements with the other GEN-IV participating governments to perform and develop technologies relevant to super critical water designs.  Due to the very high temperatures and power levels, it is desirable to improve heat transfer coefficients to the greatest extent practicable in order to provide increased margins of safety.   Using nano-scale particles suspended in the coolant may be a novel and previously unexplored method for improving heat transfer in high heat flux components on nuclear reactors. Experimental work to date indicates that the impact on heat transfer of nanoparticles is much larger than that related to property differences imposed by the multi-component nature of the nanofluid.  However, the mechanism and transport of the particles, their interaction with the flow and impact on nuclear fuel cooling, as well as the anticipated improvement in Super Critical Water Reactors, has not been previously investigated.    Only a very limited amount of research has been conducted and published in nanofluidic heat transfer, and further research represents a unique opportunity to develop a strong scientific center here in Canada.

"The existing fleet of nuclear reactors has been operating for 20 to 30 years and is primarily the

second-generation design. The third generation of nuclear reactor designs is being developed to replace the

fleet, and some designs have moved into the construction phase. There is now a large amount of preliminary

research and design activities being conducted on the fourth generation technologies (GEN-IV reactors). The

GEN-IV supercritical water nuclear reactor design will employ temperatures and pressures on the order of 500

C and 24 MPa, which are well beyond conditions prevalent in current nuclear reactors. The objective of this

work is to establish postulated design-basis-accident scenarios, perform simulations of potential accident

scenarios, and assess requirements for automatic reactor trip parameters for a conceptual GEN-IV reactor.

Since many input parameters for these analyses are still unknown, or tentative at best, the uncertainties in each

parameter will have to be assessed and included as part of an integrated uncertainty analysis. The development

and application of analysis methods given uncertain or unestablished inputs meshes well with ongoing research

in Safety Analysis for operating CANDU reactors being performed at McMaster. The end result of this

research will be methodologies for GEN-IV design and analysis, and documentation of the probabilistic

outcomes and key sensitivities. This project will aid in defining the methodologies and tools necessary for the

analysis of conceptual GEN-IV designs. These results and methods will then be available to aid in the

downstream design and development of the SCWR concept.

"This research proposal deals with the optimal shape analysis and computations applied to hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) and artificial hearts (AH). This project is part of my efforts to build at University of Ottawa a center of shape analysis and high performance optimal shape computations. 

    For HFC application my final objective is to enhance HFC efficiency by using shape optimization techniques. Namely, I intend to improve water and gas transport by shape optimization of fiber shapes in gas diffusive layers (GDL), pore shape of channel/GDL interface and the HFC channel geometry. 

    For AH application the goal is to find the best AH shape, i.e. the shape minimizing the blood shear stress, vortices and stagnation - which are major factors of fatalities. 

    From mathematical standpoint, the dynamics of these applications are governed by a system of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE), including Navier-Stokes equations and heat and mass conservation laws (coupled with a differential equation in the case of AH). The final objective is to solve a shape optimization problem, i.e. to find a domain D* minimizing a shape functional D->J(D), where D is an admissible shape and J(D) is a functional measuring the action of desirable and undesirable effects. 

    I intend to study the existence of solutions to these PDEs, to analyse their shape differentiability and to look for the solution of the associated shape minimization problem (analysis and computation). Moreover, I intend to carry 2D and 3D shape computations. 

    To my knowledge, this proposal represents a first attempt to control HFC dynamics using shape optimization techniques. For the HFC application, though there exist some results in Engineering literature, this proposal is a first one to consider the problem from a rigorous mathematical and numerical shape optimization viewpoint. Due to the specific nature of our system of PDEs (strongly nonlinear) we expect to find original results related to their solution and the associated shape optimization problems.

"Well-covered graphs: Divide-and-conquer is a well-tried and useful approach to hard problems. On the other hand, well-covered graphs have the property that hard problems (like scheduling jobs or examinations) are easy: the hard part is recognizing when a graph is well-covered. A labeling approach based on recognizing when two `jobs' cannot be scheduled at the same time partitions the graph into well-covered subgraphs that allows an easy but good starting point from which to schedule all the `jobs'.



`Decontaminating a network' can mean catching intruders to cleaning up chemical or biological contamination. Of particular interest for this proposal is the situation where the network has to be cleaned regularly because of a slow growing contaminant which may be anything from algae in the pipes of a power plant to dust in a house. 

 

Combinatorial games are two person games of perfect information and without chance elements. The theory provides techniques for determining who can win from a game position and how.  While ad hoc techniques for such analysis are as old as humanity, the modern theory employs more powerful and general tools such as the notion of a game-theoretic value and reduced canonical form.  From a mathematical standpoint, these techniques can be brought to bear to completely solve a wide variety of games.

"This research program is directed towards the modeling of planning and operational issues faced by loyalty reward programs (LRPs). The loyalty programs industry is today an important economic sector that involves millions of Canadians who have embraced the many LRPs that exist across a spectrum of industries (travel, hotel, retail, telecommunication, banking, etc.). New LRPs are being established worldwide and existing ones have been restructured to contribute to value growth and enhance their competitive advantage. The growth of many LRPs has been considerable in recent years in terms of, for example, membership enrolment and activities; joint ventures with customer partners; diversification of sources for collection of points; diversification of reward offerings; and total rewards cost incurred. This growth has considerably increased the complexities faced by firms in managing their loyalty programs. However, despite increases in complexities, few academic models exist today to support planning and operational decision making in loyalty program industry. This work seeks to contribute to the reduction of this gap by developing and implementing analytical-based (operations research/management science) models to address a number of issues that are central for the efficiency and the effectiveness of LRPs organizations. The objectives on this research work include: (a) developing aggregate and disaggregate models to address predictive modeling issues such as liability forecasting, redemption forecasting, and prediction of award supply and demand;  (b) exploring how revenue management methodologies can be applied to LRPs; (c) proposing models for designing and managing partnership relationships; and (d) developing and comparing alternate methods to cope with the determination of the breakage factor, a key component for revenue recognition in loyalty programs industry.","Production and operations management","Carleton University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Gestion de la production","G�nie industriel"

"Maintenance of the cellular acidity (pH) is important for most cell types as the majority of biochemical reactions and protein structures are tightly regulated by pH within the physiological range.  This is especially the case with nerve cells (neurons) that conduct nerve impulses.  In addition to the fundamental roles commonly observed in various cell types, highly localized and transient pH regulation mechanisms play crucial roles in modulating neuronal activities.  For example, pH shifts modulate excitability because the function of many ion channels that are responsible for creating and conveying electric stimuli along the neuron is substantially influenced by changes in pH.  Electric stimuli at the specialized structure located close to the adjacent neuron stimulate to release chemical substances called ""neurotransmitters"".  This is sensed by ""receptors"" that bind to and react with the neurotransmitter.  Release of neurotransmitters and recognition by the receptor allow neurons to transmit signals from one neuron to another.  Neuronal pH regulates both release of neurotransmitters and proper function of receptors.  Not surprisingly, neurons possess a number of sophisticated mechanisms to regulate cellular pH.  Among them, Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs), a group of ion transporters that exchange Na+ for H+ across membranes are proposed to be one of the most prominent players.  This notion was strongly supported by the previous finding that genetic depletion of an NHE gene that is expressed in most cell types (NHE1) show brain damage leading to seizures and neuronal cell death.  Interestingly, among nine additional NHEs that share similar structure and function, NHE5 is abundantly expressed in brain.  Our research group has shown previously that NHE5 has a number of unique characters different from that of NHE1.  The unique feature of NHE5 may account for novel roles in brain.  We will test our hypothesis in which NHE5 regulates neuronal function and neuronal development by using various model cell systems.  Our research will help advance basic knowledge in our understanding of pH regulation in neurons and aim to determine its impact on brain functions such as learning and memory.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","University of British Columbia",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Membranes cellulaires","Biologie cellulaire"

"Multicellular organisms display a variety of sensory receptors, which allow them to sense variations in environmental stimuli, and make appropriate responses crucial for survival. Since oxygen (O2) is essential for the survival of many organisms, specialized O2-receptors help maintain an optimal supply of oxygen to the body tissues so as to meet the metabolic needs of individual cells. Some of these O2-receptors are able to detect CO2/H+ as well. The cellular/molecular mechanisms of O2 and CO2/H+ sensing are not well understood. My laboratory is interested in understanding these mechanisms, as well as their evolution in vertebrates. Much of our work to date has focused on air-breathing mammals, where particular chemoreceptive organs (e.g. carotid body and adrenal gland) contain cells endowed with specialized mechanisms for detecting low O2 (hypoxia) and elevated CO2/H+. The basic mechanisms probably arose first in water-breathing animals, e.g. fish, and with the aid of NSERC support over the last several years my laboratory carried out an important series of pioneering studies on the mechanisms of O2 sensing and innervation patterns in the zebrafish gill model. We studied how specific ion channel proteins in these receptors (i.e. neuroepithelial cells or NECs) are modified by low O2, and how nerve fibers project to these cells in several aquatic vertebrates. In this renewal application we will extend our comparative analysis to include NECs of the amphibian (Xenopus) gill. Our working hypothesis is that the fundamental mechanisms of O2 and CO2/H+ sensing, that have been studied extensively in mammals, arose first in water-breathers and are conserved among the vertebrates. We will test the idea that regulation of K+ channel activity is a highly conserved mechanism in these sensing pathways and that the recently-proposed gaseous signaling molecule, i.e. hydrogen sulfide (H2S), may play a more general role in hypoxia-sensing. This important research is expected to yield insight into how animals (including humans) sense and adapt to low O2 and high CO2/H+ conditions, and why failure to do so leads to life-threatening situations.

"In many Canadian cities, strong economic growth and rapidly changing socio-demographic structures are creating enormous pressure on urban transportation systems. Such situations demand proper maintainance of exististing transportation systems and also building new transportation infrastructures. In order to maintain existing systems efficiently and develop new infrastructures sustainably, we need analytical models that can predict the evolution of demands for urban transportation in future. Existing state-of-the art model, known as activity-based travel demand model fails to replicate complex travel patterns over a short-term time period. It is necessary to develop a new methodology for activity-based travel demand model that can replicate reliably the evolution of peoples' activity/travel patterns over short- to medium- and long-term time periods. 



The major objectives of this research are to (a) Develop the conceptual and computational architecture for a microsimulation framework of dynamic activity-based travel demand model, and (b) Formulate and estimate a set of behavioural models for activity/travel patterns formation of urban residents.



Applying a process-oriented microsimulation approach is appropriate to capture the dynamics of activity/travel demand over a single day time period that generates activity/travel patterns. The model to be developed in this research will replicate the  evolution of activity/travel patterns of the urban residents over time. This gives the platform to simulate transportation policy responses for a wide range of time frames. With this model it is possible to test different policy scenarios (transportation, land use and other policies that affect the transportation system) in a ""virtual"" setting. The tool will help various government agencies, when making policy decisions, to be more informed about the resulting impacts on traffic congestion, road safety, air quality, noise and the overall sustainability.

"In general, many Canadian industries are progressing toward less expensive and smaller environmental footprint technologies, in particular the fine chemicals and energy industry. Catalysis has played a major role in achieving cleaner, less expensive, and more environmentally friendly solutions for countless applications. The project addresses competitive manufacturing of functional materials that enable advantaged catalytic performance. Our aim is to develop a robust arranged catalyst suitable for applications in three-phase structured hydrogenation reactors (e.g., fine chemical production; oil upgrading), which would allow increased productivity (up to order-of magnitude, as expected) at decreased energy and hydrogen consumption. One of the proposed applications of this strategy is hydrotreating of heavy oils with high metal content, which addresses Canada's needs in developing advanced functional materials for cheaper, safer and more environmentally benign technologies, as well as industry needs in innovative breakthrough approaches to heavy oil hydrotreating.

A boosted catalytic behaviour can be achieved both due to the structured reactor hydrodynamics and new support characteristics. In the current proposal, we aim to develop the required new arranged catalyst to be suitable for further reactor design and its stable operation under harsh hydrotreating conditions. The catalyst support will be optimized using an inexpensive and easy technique. A support arranged structure and control over its porosity will increase the material catalytic activity and will considerably prolong its lifetime under the conditions of high V and Ni content in the feed. The catalyst stability and regeneration ability will be addressed. The personnel trained in this project will work closely with industry to share knowledge and learn about the Alberta energy industry, developing their professional skills, and preparing them for future careers in Canadian industry.","Materials performance","University of Alberta",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Structure, propri�t�s et essais des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"
"Structural materials used in biomedical implants are rarely in a stress or strain free state; residual manufacturing stresses and in service stresses may exist. Interestingly, residual stress can have a direct impact on how biomedical devices perform, and because residual stress can affect the mechanical behavior of all materials, understanding the relationship between bioactivity and mechanical properties is paramount in further development of biomedical materials. We have found that residual stresses alter the dissolution behaviour of bioactive glasses which are used for bone regrowth and repair in dental and orthopedic surgery. We are in the process of developing a model to describe such a phenomenon and our proposed research will attempt to further understand the relationship between mechanical stress and dissolution behaviour (called the mechanochemical effect), but also investigate how the mechanical behaviour of the material is altered by reaction with the biological environment (called the chemomechanical effect).  Our underlying goal is to assess the feasibility of processing biomedical materials through local adjustment of residual stresses before implantation in order to create gradients of bioactivity on implants to prevent against premature failure.

The study will employ two graduate students; the students will be trained in the processing and characterization of bioactive glass, and in the mechanical testing and in vitro response of stressed and unstressed bioactive glass. The students will also be involved in developing a thermodynamic model to describe the change in dissolution rate with sign of the residual stress. The efforts of the students are anticipated to contribute new understanding of biomedical materials behaviour that will allow for smart biomedical device design and manufacture, and integration of bioactive glasses in composite material implants. Impacts on the public will be improved recovery times and quality of life, and longer implant lifetimes. Another benefit of the research will be the contribution to training personnel in the interaction of materials with their environments, thus helping to foster a workforce in biomedical materials design.

"This grant application is to fund a technical team which provides computer and technical support at Carleton University for research in particle physics. This team consists of a designer, an electronics specialist, a technician and a software and grid computing expert. This team of people has many years of experience in designing, building and installing detectors for particle physics experiments and in providing computer support for simulation and data analysis. Highlights of these activities include apparatus built for experiments at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory in Geneva and components for the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) located in the INCO Creighton Mine in Sudbury, Ontario. For CERN, the group built detectors to locate and measure particle tracks with high precision and very dense detectors to absorb and measure the total energy of high energy particles.   For SNO, the group designed and built water purification systems for both the light and heavy water used to study neutrinos coming from the sun. These water systems reduced the contamination in both kinds of water to levels never before achieved.



The proposed activities of the group for the tenure of the MRS grant is to assist in the design and development of innovative detectors for the newly funded SNOLAB (also located in Sudbury) and  future international accelerators. SNOLAB experiments will explore more deeply the properties of the elusive neutrino and look for ""dark matter particles"" that appear to dominate the material of the universe. Detectors will be developed for future accelerators including the International Linear Collider (ILC) which will be a precision machine at the energy frontier and an upgraded particle collider at CERN. Detector work for the ILC is targeted to produce a complete experiment design by 2010. The technical group will also be supporting simulation and data analysis for Carleton's experimental program through hardware and software developments and the establishment of the infra-structure for distributed grid computing.

"The construction of molecules with complex structures is a central theme of chemical research. In the last two decades synthetic chemists have carried this concept of molecular design into an entirely new realm. They have focussed their attention on the ultimate structural challenge - the crystallization of discrete molecular systems  with predetermined packing patterns, i.e., the control of solid state architecture at the sub-nanoscale level. The objectives of controlled crystal growth vary widely, but share a common theme, namely the need to arrange molecules so that the resulting supramolecular assembly has the desired structure, stability and property. Securing any one of these three objectives represents a challenge in its own right, but success is only truly achieved when all three goals are accomplished at the same time.



This proposal addresses the design of multifunctional molecular materials that display both conductive and magnetic properties. The challenge lies not only in controlling architectural issues, but also in creating molecules (building blocks) whose electronic structures exhibit the necessary requirements for charge migration and magnetic coupling throughout the bulk solid. 



Most synthetic conductors require two components.  In these so-called charge transfer salts electrons must be moved from one component to the other in order to create charge carriers.  The present proposal advocates a different approach, one which obviates the need for charge transfer by using free radicals. In these one-component systems potential charge and spin carriers are already ""built in"". While direct and immediate applications are not addresed in this proposal, the results of this research will have many implications in the design of new electronic and magnetic materials. The electronics and communications industries would be the primary beneficiaries.

"Barley silage is one of the primarily forages used in western Canada, and quality of barley silage affects

productivity of lactating dairy cows and profitability of dairy operations. Pioneer Hi-Bred International has

developed a novel bacterial inoculant (a proprietary strain of Lactobacillus buchneri), which produce ferulate

esterases (FE). Application of this inoculant is expected to increase fibre digestibility of forages and

productivity of lactating dairy cows. However, effects of this inoculant on feeding values of whole-crop barley

silage have not been evaluated. As such, the objective of the proposed preliminary study is to evaluate effects

of application of ferulate-esterase producing inoculant on fibre digestibility of whole crop barley silage and

productivity of dairy cows. Twelve lactating dairy cows in peak lactation will be assigned to replicated 4 � 4

Latin squares with 21-d periods balanced for carry-over effects. Treatments will be dietary grain allocation (30

vs. 40% of dietary DM) and barley silage (inoculated vs. control) in a 2 � 2 factorial arrangement of treatments.

Primary response variables are feed intake, milk yield, milk composition, body weight change, and plasma

metabolites. The proposed study is expected to benefit Pioneer Hi-Bred Limited by providing preliminary

scientific merits of this novel bacterial inoculant, and lead future collobrative forage research between the

University of Alberta and Pioneer Hi-Bred Limited. In addition, the proposed research project may provide a

management option with dairy producers to consistently enhance forage quality, contributing to profitable dairy

operations.","Agriculture and primary food production","University of Alberta",1,"EGP   ","Engage Grants Program                                                                               ","Nutrition et �levage des animaux","Biologie animale"

"Since the 1940s, it has been widely accepted to assume that chloride is conservative in soil and chloride is commonly used as a conservative tracer in budget calculations of other substances within watersheds. However, the past decade of research suggests that chloride participates in a complex biogeochemical cycle. There is strong evidence that a widespread chlorination (consumption of chloride) in soil as a result of microbial activity whereas it is still unknown whether degradation of chlorinated organic matter (release of chloride) is mainly biotic or abiotic. However, it is clear that soil can act both as a sink and a source of chloride, depending on whether the mineralization or formation/volatilization/leaching processes dominate. 

The project is outlined in three interrelated parts conducted as combined field and laboratory studies with focus on fundamental research questions related to the impact of land-use and environmental variables on the chlorine cycle. 

The first aim is to quantify major components of the chlorine cycle at a watershed scale. The second aim is to evaluate the ecological role of chlorination by testing three hypotheses: i) reactive chlorine is used to inhibit competing microbes, ii) chlorination is related to microbial defense against O2 stress and iii) chlorination increases the microbial availability of soil organic matter and enhances soil respiration rates. 

The third aim is to investigate the fate and kinetics of Cl-in in soil by using 36-Cl to test four hypotheses: i) a considerable portion of Cl-in in soil is transformed to Cl-org under aerobic conditions, ii) Cl-in is slowly released from organic matter under anaerobic conditions due to degradation of chlorinated organic matter, iii) prevailing geochemical models of Cl-in behavior are unreliable due to that they do not take transformation of Cl-in to Cl-org in soil into account and, iv) the rate and extent to which radioactive chlorine enters the biosphere is underestimated due to that formation/degradation of Cl-org in soil is not included in the models.

"Most living organisms thrive on oxygen to obtain energy from glucose needed to sustain life. Unfortunately reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation are by-products of oxygen metabolism which can be lethal to cells and have been linked to age associated diseases e.g cardiovascular, neurodegenerative diseases, and rheumatoid arthritis. Also of concern are endogenous reactive carbonyl species (RCS), by-products of glucose and fat metabolism. RCS can carbonylate essential proteins and/or nucleic acids thereby injuring cells which have also been linked to diseases, particularly diabetic complications and cardiovascular disease. Carbonyl by-products typically appear as either 1) unsaturated carbonyls formed from the decomposition products of lipid oxidation, e.g acrolein or 2) dicarbonyl species e.g glyoxal and methylglyoxal, formed from glucose by glycolysis or 3) acrolein or chloroacetaldehyde formed by the metabolism of cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide anticancer drugs. Recently we have discovered that RCS markedly increases ROS toxicity and are researching the molecular mechanisms involved. Others have also shown that minimal inflammation associated with oxidative stress increases RCS hepatotoxicity in vivo. We postulate that inflammatory cells increase RCS toxicity by forming ROS. Inflammatory cells cause oxidative stress in tissues largely because of an NADPH oxidase enzyme that forms ROS. We will use an oxidase inhibitor to prevent RCS induced tissue toxicity caused by the above anticancer drugs. The molecular mechanisms for the different susceptibility of normal cells versus tumor cells to ROS or RCS or ROS together with RCS will be investigated. The proposed research involves identifying target proteins and metabolising enzymes modulating the toxicity pathway. A novel application of QSAR will be used to determine why some dicarbonyls are toxic whereas others are not. As well, QSAR will identify the structural basis for dicarbonyl toxicities in different tissues using inhibitors of ROS/RCS detoxifying enzymes. It is hoped that this approach will lead to the development of novel QSAR techniques for comparing molecular toxicity mechanisms associated with ROS and RCS formation.

"Environment Canada estimates that 29% of the population consumes groundwater as their domestic water so protection of this resource is essential to the health and well-being of Canadians.  Historically, the subsurface was thought to act as a natural filter of wastes injected into the ground.  The potential for these wastes to persist in the subsurface for decades, potentially contaminating drinking water sources was ignored.  Non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs), such as perchlorethlyene and dichloroethane, are one class of waste liquids that were subject to improper disposal practices. These liquids are extremely difficult to remove from subsurface aquifers and are the focus of this proposal.  Nanometals are one promising innovative groundwater remediation technology that convert these contaminants into less toxic or nontoxic materials. They are particularly useful because of their size - a single human hair is 500 to 5,000 times as wide.  At that scale, they can move through microscopic flow channels in soil and rock, reaching and destroying groundwater pollutants that larger particles cannot. In this study reactive nanometals will be developed to degrade subsurface NAPL source zones. This project will support 7 graduate students and 2 postdoctoral fellows to conduct an integrated reactive nanometal synthesis, characteri- zation, reactivity and mobility research program. Although nanoparticles may represent a novel approach for the remediation of subsurface contaminated sites significant research is still necessary to significantly develop this technology. This study will provide invaluable information regarding nanometal mobility in the subsurface and develop a new remediation technology that is urgently needed to ensure a clean and abundant source of drinking water for Canadians for generations to come.",Water,"University of Western Ontario",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","G�nie de l'environnement","G�nie de l'environnement"

"Directed cell motility is an essential biological function for a variety of cells and tissues.  This is particularly important in the development of the nervous system, as neurons must extend long cellular processes and establish precise connections with other neurons in order to wire up the brain correctly.  Directed nerve cell extension relies on the: (1) ordered arrangement of cellular and molecular cues that guide neurons in the embryonic environment , (2) exploration of the environment by the motile tip (growth cone) of the neuron, (3) intracellular signaling mechanisms which are activated by growth cone contact with the appropriate guidance cue, (4) modification of the intracellular scaffolding (cytoskeleton) and reorientation of the motile tip and (5) consolidation of the cytoskeleton into a mature and stable axon fascicle.

        The aim of this research proposal is to identify the intracellular signalling mechanisms important for neuronal outgrowth and to determine their effect on the cytoskeletal network.  Two major projects will be undertaken.  The first will test the role of a specific protein, called calpain, which we have recently shown to play a key role in growth cone motility and axon consolidation.  This protein is a protease, that is, it cleaves and inactivates many other proteins.  Our goal is to determine which proteins regulate the activity of calpain and which proteins are inactivated by calpain and are important for neuronal growth.  These dual roles for calpain in regulating the structure of the axon and the motility of the growth cone have never been proposed before and our research should provide novel insights into the basic and important process of neuronal growth.  Our second major project is to examine how the cytoskeleton changes in a neuron as it grows in its normal embryonic environment.  Using a model insect system of neuronal growth, we will analyze the location and timing of key regulators of cytoskeleton function in order to assess how neurons grow and turn in response to embryonic guidance cues.  Using sophisticated imaging technologies we will provide some of the first observations of cytoskeletal dynamics of growing neurons in their embryonic environment.

"Online auctions play an important and integral part in modern business. From mainly having been perceived as online flea-markets for the consumer-to-consumer market, they are today used by many well-established firms in the business-to-consumer markets. For instance, companies represented on eBay.com include Sears, IBM, Fujitsu and Dell. Companies and organizations that host their own auctions include Dell, Major League Baseball, shopNBC and Comet. One common use of online auctions is as alternative salvage channels. For example, both Dell and Fujitsu use their online auction channel to sell refurbished products from returned and remaining inventory. The first part of this research project is to propose models and derive results that will help companies in deciding how to release items for online auction in order to maximize profit.



With the introduction of online auctions, bidders are no longer limited to only participating in one auction. Contrariwise, at any given time there can be many online auctions for the exact same product. Therefore bidders not only have to decide when and how much to bid, but also in which auction to participate. The second part of this research is to develop optimal bidding strategies. That is, when, how much, and in which auction should a bidder bid in order to maximize his/her expected gain.



The third part of the research is to conduct an empirical study on online auctions and online bidding behavior, in order to validate the models and results from the first two parts. Data for the statistical analysis comes from eBay auctions conducted by Dell in 2006, and consists of over 6,000 auctions and 100,000 bids.","Information systems and technology","University of Western Ontario",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Recherche op�rationnelle et science de la gestion","G�nie industriel"
"Techniques such as laser cooling can now cool gases of atoms to temperatures as low as a few billionths of one degree above absolute zero (nK). These ""ultracold"" atoms behave in a very quantum mechanical way because their de Broglie wavelengths are so large (~�m, i.e., 5 orders of magnitude larger than at room temperature). Ultracold atoms have already been used to make new states of matter such as Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in which every atom in the gas has the same quantum wave function. However, the scientific potential of ultracold atoms is not just confined to fundamental quantum mechanics; their motional state can be controlled to such an unprecedented degree that they are also beginning to play an important role in precision measurements of nature's forces and constants. My research concerns the theory behind both of these aspects. 



Firstly, I propose to continue my studies of BECs in which the atoms interact via dipole-dipole interactions. This is of particular relevance to polar molecules. The idea is to investigate how these long-range and anisotropic interactions affect properties such as superfluidity. Secondly, I want to initiate Canadian studies of ultracold atoms trapped inside optical microcavities. This marriage of cavity quantum electrodynamics with the quantum motion of atoms combines two of our best controlled physical systems and so promises to be a natural arena for quantum information processing as well as precision measurement of forces at short distances. Thirdly, I plan to investigate how macroscopic superpositions of ultracold atoms suffer from decoherence, e.g. in Josephson junctions. This is closely tied in to the second topic above and is relevant to a number of ultracold atom experiments currently being carried out in Canada.

"It is currently unclear why some lakes in Canada have fish and animals with high levels of contaminants while other similar lakes do not. The speciation of contaminants (or chemical form) is known to be a key factor controlling their movement in ecosystems and uptake by organisms. Speciation in turn is controlled by photochemical reactions which respond in different ways to changes in solar radiation, and interactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM) (the decay products of plant and animal matter). However, the exact relationships between these variables are poorly understood. The general goal of my research program is to determine the effects of solar radiation and DOM on contaminant fate in freshwaters. More specifically, I will collect water samples from a range of lakes and characterize differences in DOM structure. I will then use controlled laboratory experiments to test the effects of DOM structure and different wavebands of radiation on the photochemical reactions that control the fate and speciation of contaminants. The initial focus will be on mercury, which has a wide range of organic and inorganic properties, and is therefore useful as a model system for other contaminants. Mercury is also a highly toxic contaminant and due to its wide dispersion it is both a regional and a global concern. I anticipate that this research will result in predictive models that describe key factors controlling contaminant speciation and fate in ecosystems. This will increase our ability to predict which freshwater ecosystems are most likely to have significant contaminant accumulations in organisms. This in turn will benefit Canada by supporting effective regulatory policies and mitigative measures to protect the health of sensitive freshwater ecosystems and the human and wildlife populations that they sustain.",Environment,"Acadia University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","�cotoxicologie","�volution et �cologie"

"An important aspect to modern pharmaceutical manufacturing is the concept of chirality or handedness. This molecular property can have significant consequences for drug activity and safety, as the molecules in our body also possess this property. Handedness is currently introduced into many pharmaceuticals through the use of complex materials containing transition metals. This can present potential toxicity problems and increase the cost of drug manufacturing. Our group is developing novel organo-catalysts for various transformations. These compounds do not require metals and are derived from naturally occurring substances. We are employing a rational design approach to try to improve on the performance of existing systems. Specifically addressed are the issues of long reaction times and high catalyst loadings that are typical of many organo catalytic transformations. A consideration of the overall reaction sequence has inspired us to approach the problem from a rational basis to try to improve these reactions. This approach has lead to the discovery of novel catalytic structures derived from camphor, that are useful in Diels-Alder cycloadditions and other useful processes. We propose to explore fully the scope of these processes and to expand the range of catalytic functions for which these compounds can be employed.","Physical sciences","University of Ottawa",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","M�thodologie en synth�se","Chimie organique"
"Researchers with graduate degrees have an extra responsibility to become leaders in research. To do this they must be excellent researchers, outstanding leaders, and have excellent people-skills. Traditional scientific graduate degrees address only the first point, leaving new researchers to fend for themselves when dealing with subordinates, supervisors, budgets, planning and the various other pressures associated with leadership.

Our new degree will enhance the strong scientific training our students have always enjoyed by introducing new courses in areas such as process chemistry, medicinal chemistry and drug development. Our plan is to offer many of these courses in collaboration with major Canadian pharmaceutical companies, holding the courses at the companies themselves. This will expose our graduates to material that is otherwise not available in a university setting, and at the same time will provide opportunities to interact with medicinal chemists working in industry. Our graduates will have the opportunity to meet some of the key researchers in the Canadian pharmaceutical sector, to begin the networking that will enable them to find jobs at top quality companies in Canada.

These young scientists will be leaders in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, and the development of management backgrounds will enable them to compete better in industry and academia. We will provide them with knowledge, understanding and tools to succeed and excel in an industry that is currently maturing by developing, in collaboration with the Telfer School of Management of the University of Ottawa, courses specifically designed to address the needs of young managers in the Biopharmaceutical industry.

"Vibrations in engineering structures in either a terrestrial or a space environment are generally undesirable because they undermine the performance of the structure and could result in structural failure. The traditional method of suppressing structural vibrations is by overlaying the structure with a polymer (rubbery material) that has the ability to dissipate energy. Further improvements in the degree of vibration suppression occurred in the late 1950s when the polymer was sandwiched between the structure and another layer of material called the constraining layer. The means by which these techniques work are generally referred to as passive vibration damping (PD) and passive constrained layer vibration damping (PCLD), respectively.

    )	The major disadvantages of PD and PCLD are their inability to change or adapt to different operating conditions. A possible solution that is of active research interest is to make the constraining layer, in the case of PCLD, from materials that have both sensing and actuating capabilities. Piezoelectric materials are one such type material and they will be used in the proposed research. The damping technique is classified as intelligent active constraining layer vibration damping (ACLD) because of the actuation and sensing that can be achieved with these materials.

    )	The complexity of the ACLD process supports the need for both experimental and computer simulation investigations. The requested Discovery Grant will be directed at addressing the latter, while the former is a component of the long-term research effort. Over the duration of the requested Discovery Grant, attention will be focused on improving the means of modelling these active damping systems to effectively capture the damping process. A good model will yield a better understanding of the system dynamics, which can be used to design efficient, effective and robust control schemes.

    )	This technology can be readily applied in industries such as aerospace, electronics, medical services, civil engineering structures, sporting-goods, automobile and marine applications.

"Problems in human-automation interaction have contributed to major failures in expensive, high-risk, and safety-critical systems, yet few mathematical methods or tools to analyze human-automation systems exist.  To address this void, my research creates general methods and tools to identify problems in human-automation interaction before systems are built, tested, and deployed.  For example, ""automation surprises"", which occur when the automation does something the user does not expect, have been implicated in many aircraft incidents and accidents (Nagoya 1994, Toulouse 1996).  My methods are based on reachability analysis, which provides a mathematical guarantee of safety by identifying all states which could lead to an ""unsafe"" target (e.g., a stall condition).  Used to prevent automation surprises and other undesirable phenomena in engineered systems, the developed computational tools and methods can significantly impact engineered system design and reliability.  



I focus in particular on human interaction with hybrid control systems, which have both continuous dynamics (from physical processes) and discrete dynamics (from high-level computer control of the physical processes).  The interaction between continuous and discrete dynamics can create highly non-intuitive behaviors; human input (pushing buttons, toggling levers, or joystick input) introduces further complications.  The novelty of the proposed research is twofold: a) an extension of verification techniques to guarantee safety in systems that are semi-automated, and b) application of verification techniques to detect the correctness of human-automation interaction (e.g., identifying when the user would have to ""fight"" the automation, automation surprises, or others).   One application of particular interest is powered wheelchairs, whose liability currently hinders their use in group home facilities and limits mobility of Canadians with physical disabilities.  By developing automation to make powered wheelchairs ""provably safe"", we can limit the danger these powerful machines pose, and potentially improve quality of life for disabled Canadians.

"Ordered intermetallic-based alloys and compounds constitute a new class of metallic materials which have unique properties for high-temperature structural applications in hostile environments, such as aero and land-based gas-turbine engines. They have been the subject of intense research in recent decades, and are being considered as potential replacements for the nickel-based superalloys, which have nearly reached the upper limit of their high-temperature capability. However, the industrial application of these advanced materials (i.e. the fabrication and repair of structural components made of them) will require effective, economic joining techniques. While the application of fusion welding to most intermetallics has been limited due to severe weld cracking, alternate advanced techniques such as transient-liquid-phase (TLP) bonding hold potential for joining these materials. Unfortunately, the commercial use of TLP bonding is limited because of the inadequate understanding of microstructural development during the bonding of multicomponent base-filler alloy systems. 



Dr. Ojo proposes to use extensive, state-of-the-art electron microscopy and spectroscopy techniques to systematically study, in detail, the influence of process and material variables on microstructural evolution during the TLP bonding of newly developed Ni3Al-based intermetallic alloy IC 6. Furthermore, his research team will attempt to develop a post-bond heat treatment scheme for homogenizing the bonded materials chemically and microstructurally - a process imperative to ensuring reliable high-temperature properties. The proposed study will significantly advance the current understanding of TLP bonding mechanisms, and provide inputs vital to the effective modeling and optimization of the joining process. Ultimately, the research will contribute to the development of the effective and reliable procedures for joining advanced structural intermetallics crucial to their novel application, and thereby to enhancing Canada's competitiveness in pioneering advanced technology.

"The urban heat island (UHI) is the characteristic warmth of a town or city compared with its surrounding countryside. For a city of about 1 million the annual UHI is about 1 Celsius degree but under favourable conditions may be as large as 12 degrees. It is the most obvious example of human impact on climate. UHIs seem simple enough: easy to find, measure and perhaps explain and have many practical implications for human comfort and heat stress, costs of heating or cooling house and the length of the growing season. It also affects the mixing and chemistry of air pollutants and several other weather phenomena including humidity, fog, frost, local breezes, cloud development and thunderstorms. Despite the apparent simplicity of UHIs they are in fact complex and multi-faceted and unfortunately in the applicant's opinion have not been studied rigorously. Using strict new scientific protocols, based on the extensive experience of the applicant, existing work will be analyzed to create a modern synthesis of the UHI. It will clarify and quantify the true nature of the UHI and provide a reliable database against which models can be tested. The main part of the work will develop a new state-of-the-art numerical model of the UHI at the scale of street canyons and neighbourhoods plus interaction with the rest of the planetary boundary layer, that incorporates the best physics and modeling techniques available. It will include all heat exchanges by radiation, conduction and convection, flow around buildings and the role of vegetation. When verified against observations the model will be used to conduct sensitivity tests to determine the role of different physical properties of urban systems in modifying urban thermal climates. The validated model will be used to answer questions about the magnitude and dynamics of UHI anywhere in the world. This will help to quantify the effect and value of potential design solutions to mitigate negative aspects of UHIs and to aid the design of simpler tools for use by energy and water utilities, air pollution agencies, health authorities and others to more sustainably manage cities in a warmer world.","Climate and atmosphere","University of British Columbia",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�ographie physique","G�ographie physique"
"Vehicle navigation systems are an important component of intelligent transportation systems. Many current vehicle navigation systems rely on the Global Positioning System to obtain vehicle position and heading. While an unaided GPS position coupled with a digital map is effective for locating vehicles and providing driving directions, the accuracy of this kind of solution, which is on the order of five to ten metres, is insufficient for many mission-critical applications including autonomous and semi-autonoumous operation and and often unavailable in urban and tree-covered environments. Five to ten metres is sufficient to determine what road a vehicle is traveling, but insufficient to determine what lane. For the applications described above, what is of particular interest is the relative positions of vehicles. The research described in the proposal seeks to improve relative positioning of vehicles using GPS, ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging radios, and other vehicle sensors. UWB is a new radio technology that allows for very precise short distance ranging. This research will show how between vehicle UWB range measurements can be combined with GPS to allow for precise relative positioning of vehicles in environments where GPS alone is ineffective. The usefulness of integrating these two systems with onboard bearing sensors is also a goal of the project. This research will contribute directly to the future development of vehicles that are aware of surrounding vehicle positions and movements what are able to use this information to assist drivers and improve traffic movement.

"In Canada, due to cattle population demographics, receiver calves are obliged to undergo significant exposure to transport and handling, co-mingling, auction and some time off feed and water (Schaefer et al., 2003, CSAS Proceedings). Collectively, these novel events result in a significant incidence of Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) which has a considerable economic impact on the cattle industry both with respect to health and treatment costs and animal performance (Basarab et al., 1997. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 77:554; Wittum et al., 1996. J. Amer. Vet. Med. Assoc. 209:814). As discussed by Jericho and Kozub (2004. Can. J. Vet. Res. 68:127) the presence of BRD in intensively raised cattle has caused a dependence on antibiotic treatments which in turn has lead to a concern for the promotion of antibiotic resistant microbes. In fact, the ability to treat BRD in cattle is reported to be becoming more difficult due to the emergence of resistance microbes such as pneumonia in multiple sourced co-mingled cattle (Shahriar et al., 2002. Can. Vet. J. 43:863).

   BRD in receiver calves is reported to be one of the most significant economic costs to the beef industry amounting to upwards of $35 per animal or more for direct treatment and a hidden cost of up to $100 per animal in reduced performance and carcass yield and grade. In addition, the social concern regarding antibiotic resistance and the perception of reduced animal welfare in calves experiencing BRD makes the early identification and treatment of BRD economically sound. Infrared can identify BRD approximately one week earlier than clinical scores. Treating one week earlier would, at a minimum, cut treatment costs in half.

   The primary objective of this study would be to use a non-invasive infrared scanning station to early detect BRD in receiver calves in order to facilitate reduced treatment costs, improved animal performance and improved animal welfare.

"The overall goal of our metabolic research program is to make significant contributions to the beef and dairy production systems in Canada that addresses the increasing consumer demands for a sustainable and socially responsible animal agricultural industry. 

There is enough evidence to indicate a genetic basis for the variation in feed intake relative to maintenance and gain requirements and the efficiency of nutrient transport and metabolism in animals and humans. These differences in feed intake, maintenance and gain requirements measured as below or above the expected value on the basis of size and growth are now reported as residual feed intake. However, the physiological and metabolic bases for these responses remain unclear. Our preliminary data of differences in methane production, nutrient absorption and Km using ISc technology lead to believe that these differences are underpinned by measurable physiological and metabolic processes at the level of the gastrointestinal track (GIT). 

The long term goal of this laboratory is to elucidate the physiological mechanisms regulating the variation in feed intake and efficiency of nutrient utilization between animals fed similar diets.  In particular, the roles of a specific group of gastrointestinal motility indices (frequency, amplitude and duration) of contractions and specific active (Sodium+/glucose co-transporter, SGLTs 1, 2 and 3) nutrient transporters in mediating differential animal responses to altered nutrient supply to the GIT will be studied. In addition, the metabolic processes involved in the metabolism of key nutrients, glucose and glutamine and their relationships to differential nutrient/dietary induced responses in the GIT will be studied. A detailed understanding of these physiological and metabolic processes in the GIT and the roles played by motility and nutrient transporters should pave the way for future improvements in feed/food evaluations that considers not only ruminal and post-ruminal digestion but the fates of nutrients in the GIT

"Important questions that remain to be answered in mammalian fertilization are how the spermatozoan binds to and penetrates the extracellular coat (zona pellucida) of the egg after the acrosomal reaction is induced by sperm-zona contact. The prevailing idea is that as a consequence of acrosomal endocytosis and the release of the acrosomal contents, the inner acrosomal membrane (IAM) becomes exposed allowing it to directly interact with the zona, a compulsory step for subsequent IAM-directed sperm penetration through the zona. The documentation of this secondary binding step by Wassarman and colleagues (1988; 1991) stimulated a search for the protein receptor on the IAM that interacts with the zona but until our publication (Yang et al., 2006) none of the many candidates proposed met the criteria needed. Our characterization of the most prominent peripheral protein of the IAM, IAM38, supported its potential and universal role in secondary-zona binding. In this current proposal we plan to confirm this role by performing in vitro fertilization (IVF) inhibition trials utilizing specific blocking peptides derived from IAM38 that interact with ZP2, the zona-ligand responsible for binding to the IAM (Aim 1). IAM38 may be bound to an integral membrane protein, IAM32. We have identified IAM32 as a heat shock protein and aim to characterize its apparent association with the peripheral IAM protein coat (IAMC) as well as with the underlying perinuclear theca (Aim 2). Our third aim is to resolve the developmental origin and assembly of IAM32 and IAM38 and their relationship with each other, at the ultrastructural level, during acrosomal biogenesis (Aim 3). High salt and detergent extracts have revealed that in addition to IAM38 the peripheral coat of the IAM contains several serine proteases whose proteolytic action on casein zymograms can be inhibited by trypsin inhibitors. Since trypsin inhibition blocks sperm-zona penetration during IVF, these serine proteases could be prime candidates in this process. We will use a proteomic approach to identify these candidates and competitive inhibition IVF trials to test the involvement of these proteases in sperm-zona penetration (Aim 4).

Essentially a NMR on a chip, this device presents ultimate challenges in micro technology, as  it integrates, in one micro chip,   MEMS, CMOS, microfluidics as well as DC magnetic circuitry, and requires custom packaging technology.

"The proposed project will develop novel approaches to intelligent real-time tracking of spacecraft and similar

objects using active LIDAR sensors. In recent decades, active sensors have become an alternative to

conventional CCD cameras, avoiding the need for extensive ground support and pre-flight planning. Our

collaboration between researchers at Ryerson University, the Canadian Space Agency, and Neptec Design

Group will address several operational and algorithmic challenges that currently hamper LIDAR systems. New

technologies developed under this program will be tested on Neptec's TriDAR tracking system. These

innovations will improve system performance, increase reliability and expand the range of TriDAR industrial

applications. Immune to variable ambient lighting conditions, self-illuminating active sensors scan an object

with a laser beam and deliver 3D range data for pose estimation. Active sensors are particularly useful for

close-range operations between spacecraft. Sensors of this type can measure relative position, orientation and

speed.

The key goals of the project are: Goal 1 - the application of algebraic constraint analysis to (a) aid mission

planners in the selection of productive scanning area and patterns, and (b) provide a consistent real-time

assessment of tracking accuracy; and Goal 2 - the development of motion-accommodating pose estimation

based on Kalman Filtering (KF) and other signal processing techniques to propagate pose when (a) fast motion

may be involved, and (b) static tracking accuracy, as referred to in Goal 1, is limited. The proposed project will

contribute to HQP training and will increase the involvement of Canadian post-secondary institutions in

advanced science and technology research areas of interest to the Canadian Space Program. The developed

infrastructure will attract researches from other universities across the Great Toronto Area giving possibility to

obtain real range data to validate the performance computer vision algorithms.",Aerospace,"Ryerson University",3,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Intelligence artificielle (vision artificielle, utiliser 2603)","Intelligence artificielle"

"Mineral deposits are often buried beneath a cover and geophysical methods are required to discover them. Each geophysical survey provides information about a specific physical property and generally a number of different surveys are carried out to provide more complete information about the subsurface. Over the last two decades we have developed methods to invert data from individual geophysical surveys to generate 3 dimensional models of the physical property distribution. We can now invert gravity, magnetic, DC resistivity, Induced Polarization, and frequency and time domain electromagnetic data to recover 3D distributions of density, magnetic susceptibility, chargeability and electrical conductivity. With this foundation we can now focus upon other research problems. In this research we address two such problems: (a) how to design a survey that is cost effective and answers the question of interest and (b) how to construct an earth model solution that is compatible with all available geophysical and geological knowledge. Progress made in these two areas will make exploration more effective and continue to keep Canada at the forefront of mineral exploration and other applied earth sciences that involve subsurface investigations.

"Since the dawn of the electronics era, progress in electronics has primarily been achieved through a reduction in device dimensions. There is, however, a certain class of electronic device that requires size in order to be useful. Displays, scanners, solar cells, and x-ray image detectors are all examples of large area electronic devices. While in conventional electronics the emphasis may be presently on sub-micron device features, in large area electronics the focus instead is on electronic devices fabricated over substrates with dimensions of the order of a square meter. As crystalline silicon cannot be uniformly and inexpensively deposited over large areas, alternate electronic materials must be employed instead for large area electronic device applications. Amorphous and polycrystalline (disordered) semiconductors, such as hydrogenated amorphous silicon, have emerged as the active electronic materials of choice for many such applications. 

The proposed research aims to study some of the fundamental materials issues related to this class of semiconductors. In particular, we aim to develop a series of quantitative relationships between the distributions of electronic states and the various optical properties associated with disordered semiconductors. We will then use these relationships for the interpretation of optical response data corresponding to a broad range of disordered semiconductors of interest. The transport processes that occur within these materials will also be explored. We will then use the insights gleaned from these studies in order to explore the resultant device implications. In particular, the photoconductive response of a variety of x-ray photoconductors (disordered semiconductors) will be modeled and the sensitivity and resolution of proposed digital flat panel x-ray image detectors, using these materials, will be examined. The modeling of solar cells will also be pursued.

This research will help nurture the growth and development of the large area electronics industry here in Canada, an industry that has been estimated by some to have the potential to reach $ 100 Billion in sales worldwide by the year 2010.

"L'�bullition, et surtout l'�bullition en convection forc�e est l'un des proc�d�s les plus importants du transfert thermique. Elle est utilis�e dans de nombreuses applications industrielles : la production d'�nergie, thermique ou nucl�aire, le raffinage de p�trole et les syst�mes de refroidissement des appareils �lectroniques. Il y a pourtant une limitation physique stricte qui complique l'utilisation de l'�bullition dans le cas des syst�mes �nerg�tiques � haute puissance : le flux de chaleur critique (FCC). Ce terme indique, d'une fa�on g�n�rale, la situation dans laquelle la surface chauff�e s'ass�che et le transfert de chaleur se d�t�riore soudainement. Dans les syst�mes thermiques avec flux de chaleur contr�l�, cette d�t�rioration entra�ne une augmentation majeure de la temp�rature de l'�l�ment chauffant et peut amener � sa destruction. Ainsi, le FCC repr�sente un facteur capital dont la pr�diction pr�cise est essentielle afin d'assurer le fonctionnement s�curitaire et efficace des installations �nerg�tiques et, en particulier les centrales nucl�aires.

Compte tenu de la multitude et de la complexit� des processus physiques qui gouvernent le FCC, sa pr�diction est actuellement effectu�e en utilisant principalement des m�thodes et des corr�lations purement empiriques. On peut constater certains progr�s r�alis�s pour des syst�mes � g�om�trie simple, par exemple les tubes ronds chauff�s uniform�ment. Cependant, l'application de ces corr�lations � des syst�mes r�els par une extrapolation abstraite et/ou en utilisant certaines relations de correction, est pr�caire � moins que ces corr�lations ne soient bas�es sur la description des m�canismes physiques qui ont lieu dans l'�coulement diphasique. Le travail propos� est ax� sur l'�tude � long terme des m�canismes du transfert de chaleur et de masse pour faire avancer nos connaissances fondamentales en thermohydraulique diphasique et, particuli�rement, en mati�re de pr�diction du FCC. Les r�sultats de ces recherches th�oriques et exp�rimentales permettront ainsi d'augmenter la s�ret� et l'efficacit� du fonctionnement des syst�mes �nerg�tiques industriels et de contribuer grandement au d�veloppement durable.

"My research primarily concerns combinatorial matrix analysis, in which combinatorial methodology is used to solve and better understand matrix-theoretic problems.  The use of combinatorial concepts to gain insight into matrix problems spans many applications, from numerical analysis (sparse matrix theory) to dynamical systems (stability) to economics (sign solvability).  Such analysis includes aspects of graph theory, since it is often useful to view a matrix as a combinatorial object, namely a graph or a directed graph.  Problems involving sign (or zero-nonzero) pattern matrices occur in applications in, for example, economics, biology and chemistry, in systems where only the signs (or the zero-nonzero structure), rather than exact numeric values, for the entries in a connection matrix are known.

     More analytical, rather than combinatorial, techniques are required for my research involving M- and inverse M-matrices.  Nonsingular M-matrices, which have positive diagonal entries and non-positive off-diagonal entries, occur in a variety of applications including finite difference methods for solving partial differential equations and input-output production and growth models in economics.

     Primitive directed graphs also occur in many applications, such as Markov processes in statistics and probability.  My research is specifically concerned with such digraphs that have a large exponent, which means that the exponent is greater than a value that is approximately one half of the maximum possible exponent of a primitive directed graph.  Such primitive directed graphs are of interest because of their restricted graph structure.

"America's first large facility for total nitrogen removal from digested sludge dewatering liquor (centrate) has just been commissioned at the Winnipeg-North plant.  Parallel sequencing batch reactors (SBR) achieve removal of 1600 kg of nitrogen through nitrification (ammonia conversion to nitrate) and denitrification (nitrate removal to nitrogen gas).   The grant will address in full scale the potential of using the biomass produced in the SBR to augment the main stream high-purity oxygen activated sludge (HPOAS) reactors with nitrifying bacteria generated during nitrification of centrate in order to induce nitrification in the HPOAS reactors and contribute 'for free' to additional reduction of ammonia load in the whole plant.  Bioaugmentation has been tried with mixed success in the Netherlands and  Czech plants but there are a number of unknowns that need to be defined, e.g.: the amount of RAS returned; amounts of WAS produced in SBR; temperature differential between centrate SBR and HPOAS reactors; role of denitrification in restoring the alkalinity; role of dilution, beside temperature control; capacity of HPOAS to increase their own SRT before clarifiers fail.   On the other hand the overall nitrogen removal can alternatively be accomplished using an incomplete ammonia oxidation to nitrite (nitritation) which uses only two-thirds of oxygen and by denitritation which saves a third of methanol used in denitrification, thus also improving the carbon footprint.   The latter requires a change in the proposed operation of the SBR such that a higher temperature is used.  Bioaugmentation effect will be reduced as the temperature differential is increased.   The CRD project will examine both options in the whole plant, in the context of the target environmental effect of ammonia removal and associated energy and methanol saved, as Winnipeg-North is further upgraded to full nutrient removal.  Planned phosphorus co-precipitation should help retain the nitrifiers in the HPOAS bioreactors.  The results may save millions in new construction costs.   The full scale results and simulation would be applicable to all treatment plants in Canada and wherever sludge is digested and the plant is required to remove nitrogen as well as phosphorus.

"Research will address a major problem facing all Canadian municipalities: how to economically upgrade the existing wastewater treatment processes to ever more stringent effluent quality in terms of lowering the nutrients content (nitrogen and phosphorus).  Biological nutrient removal (BNR) offers the lowest cost treatment to avoid fertilization of receiving waters.  In some cases limit-of-treatment effluent levels must now be met in existing, tight urban infrastructure.  Treating cold, dilute wastewater in such conditions is difficult and leads to the costs of new or upgraded plants taht may overwhelme a municipality, e.g. the upgrade to BNR of Winnipeg's three plants, budgeted at $500 M, is now estimated to cost over $1 billion.  Organizing the 2005 IWA International BNR conference in Krakow and the BNR Limit of Treatment Workshop in Washington in 2006, the Applicant has invited the world's most accomplished BNR experts to suggest solutions to these issues. Based on their input and in anticipation of the 2007 completion of Canada's first full scale sludge liquor nitrogen removal plant in Winnipeg-North (based on the Applicant's NSERC-funded research) it is proposed to investigate: acceleration of total nitrogen removal in cold climates through bio-augmentation, anoxic stress and internally generated sources of biodegradable carbon - the latter to moderate the dilution caused by storm-water and infiltration.  A process removing total nitrogen on the membrane-based biofilm, further reducing the required treatment time will be developed.  An anaerobic autotrophic process called Anammox will be investigated as well as granular activated sludge process - the latter offers easier biomass separation and smaller tank sizes.  The work will receive the input from practitioners, including the ""father"" of BNR - Dr J. Barnard, who was consulted on the ideas and will continue to be involved. Winnipeg offers the potential for fast-track application of generated ideas as the City eagerly seeks lower budget and smaller footprint solutions to the plants' upgrade. Any improvement in the BNR process and associated solids management will decrease the financial burden to the Winnipeg and Canadian taxpayer.

"Climate change is an important issue for Canadians as it has the potential to drastically affect their quality of life. It is generally accepted that global warming can mostly be attributed to changes in the radiative forcing (changes to the heat balance between incoming solar radiation and Earth's outgoing thermal radiation) due to greenhouse gases and aerosols. Aerosols directly affect global climate by scattering and absorbing solar radiation, while they indirectly affect climate by changing the properties of clouds (i.e., their reflectivity and lifetime). However, the magnitude of the effect of aerosols on radiative forcing is complex and uncertain. The 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report shows that the uncertainty in the total net anthropogenic radiative forcing is dominated by the uncertainty in the aerosol radiative forcing.  It is important that the sources of aerosols are quantified and that the role of aerosols in climate change is understood so that the uncertainty in the forcing estimates can be reduced. This progress is necessary so that appropriate climate policies can be made and that emission control technologies can be developed and improved.



This research will focus on two important aspects of understanding how aerosols affect climate. Firstly, research will be conducted to understand the mechanisms that cause changes in the morphology of soot particles. These morphology changes can have a large impact on the light-absorption due to these particles. Secondly, the real-world particulate emissions of an in-use vehicle will be studied to understand how driving patterns and extreme ambient temperatures affect the particulate emissions.

"Recent advances in microelectronic systems and devices have been driven by the integration of systems and functionality that cannot be directly provided by conventional microelectronics. One example of this is the functionality provided by a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) that can be used as a resonant structure for low-power frequency referencing and/or filtering in a signal processing system. Developments of this nature rely heavily on understanding material properties separately and in combinations not found in nature - i.e. treating a composite material as a novel or 'artificial' material.

   This proposal will develop an emerging scanning probe microscopy technique (SPM) that can characterize the dynamic mechanical response of MEM structures and image the dynamic polarization response of materials. This will include the design and testing of an active photonic material - a switchable device that can reject microwave and millimeter wave signals in a well-defined ""stopband"" range when activated. Development of theory for the photonic devices will be supported by stroboscopic SPM experiments that can image the effects of radio-frequency surface acoustic waves. While further developing our understanding of the dynamics of artificial materials, these studies will contribute to enhanced testing of MEM structures, non-mechanical optical switches and new approaches to designing surface acoustic wave filters.

   In addition, emerging themes in the study of directed fabrication using dielectrophoresis will explore the electrical character of molecular electronic contacts as they form - and link to collaborative studies in electrophysiology of acute neural slices where new electrode materials and system-on-chip electrode designs will help strengthen this important biomedical field.

   The interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of this research will provide an exciting and rewarding environment for students to develop their skills while working on projects of practical and scientific importance.","Materials performance","University of Manitoba",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Mat�riels et composants �lectroniques","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"

"The research program is focused on reducing work related musculoskeletal injuries. The most commonly diagnosed workplace injury class in Canada today, the benefit cost paid by the Workplace, Safety and Insurance Board to Ontario injured workers in 2007 was just over 4.9 billion dollars with back and neck ailments accounting for just under 29% of lost time claims. Covering a broad spectrum ranging from relatively basic to commercializable applied work, the program involves two primary research lines: whole-body vibration (WBV) understanding and reduction in industrial mobile machine operators, and joystick operator biomechanics. Initial work resulted in the most comprehensive description to date of muscular loading and input force requirements for hydraulic actuation joysticks. As a result of understanding the physical and biomechanical demands of joystick operation, Oliver's group developed the world's first dynamic armrest which both rotates and translates to match natural arm pendulation thus minimizing the potential to develop a neck or shoulder repetitive strain injury. In the vibration research line, Oliver and her colleagues have made major contributions to the characterization of 6 degree of freedom (DOF) WBV and vehicle vibration. The group has published widely in this area and they have amassed one of the most diverse catalogs in the world of off-road vehicle vibration field profiles. The purpose of this proposal is to develop instrumentation which will ""merge"" the vibration and joystick biomechanics research lines by developing a simulator which uses field based vibration profiles to drive a hexapod platform robot while an operator manipulates joystick controllers.  Ultimately, the simulator will incorporate visual as well as haptic feedback such as would be seen and felt in an operating machine and it will allow simultaneous investigations of combinations of biomechanical, physiological, and psychophysical basic and applied research questions under realistic operating conditions.

"The primary long-term objective of this research program is to develop multidisciplinary human factors approaches to the design of tasks, tools and environments utilized in industrial applications with the goal of minimizing workplace injuries. In a complimentary long term objective, the ultimate objective of the finite element modelling is to create realistic and valid models in order to investigate the effects of physiologic loading regimens thus enabling the virtual evaluation of joysticks and other hand tools.



The reduction in musculoskeletal injuries could have profound effects including an improved quality of life for an individual worker, a reduction in Worker's Compensation costs to the employer, and a reduction in costs to an overstressed healthcare system. According to the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, work related musculoskeletal disorders are the most commonly diagnosed workplace injury class in Canada today.

"The processes related to the formation of anomalous concentrations of elements in the earth crust, also known as ore deposits, can be unraveled by evaluating source-migration-trap models at various scales of observation (from global to deposit-scale). My research over the next years will concentrate mainly on understanding the processes that are critical in the formation of world-class gold deposits (>3 million ounces of gold) hosted in sedimentary sequences. Two areas have been selected to focus the investigations over the next five years: Northern Nevada which hosts the Goldstrike Deposit (> 50 million ounces gold) and the Brazilia Belt, which hosts the Morro do Ouro Deposit (> 18 million ounces gold). This research program involves both regional and local-scale multidisciplinary studies, and the application of state-of-the art techniques to bring new insights into understanding the formation of large accumulations of gold in the upper crust. This will lead to the development of integrated source-migration-trap models and will help to refine exploration strategies of mining companies, increasing the potential for successful exploration programs in Canada, in areas sharing similar characteristics. Furthermore, the new integrated approach to investigate the mode of occurrence of gold and trace elements in sulfides also has important applications to the field of material and environmental sciences. Although arsenian pyrite, an arsenic-bearing iron sulphide, is widely known for its role as an important host for gold in ore deposits, it is also a major source of arsenic in sedimentary rocks, mine wastes and tailings. Understanding its crystal structure and crystal chemistry will be very important to evaluate its behavior during processing and weathering, and to mitigate problems related to environmental contamination by arsenic and related elements. This research program will involve training of highly qualified geoscientists who will be working in multidisciplinary collaboration between industry, government agencies, and colleagues from other research centers.

"The primary research objective in my group is the development of new synthetic methods, with emphasis on

catalytic enantioselective procedures for the simple and straightforward preparation of biologically and

commercially important molecules. The specific aims of this project involve the development of catalytic

reactions using bismuth(III) salts. We wish to explore the catalytic effects of bismuth salts because bismuth is

a cheap and non-toxic element. Moreover, Lewis acids able to catalyze enantioselective reactions under mild

and environmentally benign conditions represent an extraordinary challenge for the synthetic chemist.

The innovative element of this project is the development of catalytic enantioselective reactions using

bismuth(III) salts. Very limited examples have appeared in the literature involving catalytic asymmetric Mukaiyama aldol reactions. In this context, there is clearly a need for the development of new chiral bismuth(III) catalysts that are cheap, easy to handle, and sufficiently Lewis acidic. We wish to extend the development of a bismuth(III) based enantioselective procedure to the Mannich-type reaction. 

The project presented here falls within a research field of asymmetric organic synthesis using a bismuth(III) catalyst. This field is of significant importance as it has placed Canada at a level of excellence in the pharmaceutical and fine chemistry industry. Our proposed research program will contribute to the training of highly specialized personnel in the sectors of synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry.

"Psychiatric disorders such as substance abuse and schizophrenia involve dramatic changes in brain functioning, some of which occur at cellular or synaptic levels. Our research group measures these subtle changes and how they relate to behavioural symptoms in different disorders by combining expertise in animal models with sophisticated measures of microscopic changes in brain functioning. Currently, we are well equipped to measure rodent behaviour in standard lab tests of addiction and schizophrenia, but ability to produce precise measures of changes in brain cells function is restricted because the available equipment is utilized at full capacity and overtaxed by the large number of students using the equipment. Therefore, we request funding to improve our facility to measure brain cell function in rodents displaying symptoms and behaviours reminiscent of human schizophrenia and addiction. This new equipment would allow us to dramatically improve our productivity, and make substantial advances in the understanding of the neural basis of these disorders (as well as others). Furthermore, our students could learn to combine different methodological approaches, an important asset for their future scientific careers.",Psychology,"Queen's University",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","Neurologie du comportement -- apprentissage",Psychologie

"Electricity can be used to drive chemical reactions and, in the reverse process, chemicals can be combined indirectly to generate electricity. The first process (electrosynthesis) is used in the manufacture of chemicals for consumer products such as bleached paper and Nylon. The second process (electrochemical power generation) is the basis for the operation of electric batteries and fuel cells.  The device in which electrons (electricity) exchange with chemicals for either electrosynthesis or power generation is  an ""electrochemical reactor"". 



The projects of this grant application are part of a research program aimed to develop concepts and methods for the design of electrochemical reactors. The specific objective here is to study novel reactors for the electrosynthesis of fuels from carbon dioxide and for the use of such fuels in electrochemical power generation (fuel cells).     



The important potential results of this work are:

A. Concepts, data and design methods for novel electrochemical reactors. 

B. Electrochemical processes for conversion of carbon dioxide to fuels and industrial 

chemicals.

C. Advanced fuel cell reactor designs that reduce the cost and complexity of fuel cell systems.

D. A ""carbon neutral"" liquid fuel energy cycle driven by non-fossil sources such as nuclear or solar energy.    



These projects involve applications of ""green chemistry"" that would benefit Canada by promoting sustainable development and reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, the main gas responsible for global warming.

"Pulp screening and Low consistency refining is the primary industrial method of improving pulp quality and provides significant energy savings in mechanical pulp production. This proposed research tools and infrastructure grant would see the creation of a state-of-the-art experimental low consistency (LC) pulp processing facility at UBC's Pulp and Paper Centre (PPC) which will include fully instrumented and controlled industrial scale pulp pressure screen, conical LC refiner and large scale stainless steel tanks and mixers.   This infrastructure would be immediately used by a large team of students, industrial partners and faculty researchers.  It would be the centre piece for a large, $2.2 Million dollar, 5 year, NSERC-CRD research program that is focused on reducing electrical energy in mechanical pulp production.  This project is specifically aimed at increasing the use of the more energy efficient LC refining to replace energy transferred in the less efficient, high consistency refining.  This project brings together 8 faculty members (7 at UBC and 1 at the University of Toronto) and 10 students and staff and 11 industrial partners working in this area.  This infrastructure will allow each researcher to be able to test new ideas and concepts in all aspects, from chemical and biological treatments to new control strategies. This key infrastructure will ensure the success of the entire program.   The infrastructure will also be able to be used by our industrial partners to aid their own development and process improvement efforts.  

Mechanical pulping and papermaking is a strategically important industry for Canada.  This infrastructure will increase our natural competitive advantage, greatly enhance our current energy conservation efforts and provide timely advanced training in this important industry.

"Pulping and papermaking is an energy intensive industry, consuming 20% of BC's electrical energy.  Much of that energy is used to transport and process wood fibres in suspension (pumps, screens, hydrocyclones, etc.) and dissipated in the fluids viscosity.  The objective of this research is to develop a fundamental understanding of turbulent fibre suspensions moving near walls that can be implemented into CFD simulations and used to improve the design and operation of papermaking and pulp processing equipment with a focus on increasing energy efficiency.  Specifically, we will extend our current models to account for anisotropic turbulence and to account for the complex behaviour near walls.  A theoretical model of fibre orientation in near-wall, anisotropic turbulence will be developed and experimentally verified.  Further, experimental measurements of the near-wall velocity distribution, turbulence properties and fibre orientation will be made for flows moving near solid boundaries with a range of roughnesses.

The specific research topic falls under the ""Value-Added Wood Products and Processes"" category with papermaking applications. Here, we propose to develop novel, energy efficient technologies and processes through application and understanding of methods to reduce the turbulent drag in suspension flows used in all areas of the papermaking process. Fibre suspensions are known to exhibit turbulent drag reduction under special conditions but current processing practice does not take advantage of this. We will investigate the synergistic effects of adding drag reducing polymers and wall contour modifications to fibre suspension flows. These experimental and theoretical investigations will lead to a new understanding that will be applied to the development of new energy saving pulp processing systems, including, screen rotors, refiner plates and hydrocyclones.","Wood, wood products and paper","University of British Columbia",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Rh�ologie et transformation","G�nie chimique"
"Enhanced, multi-stage, fibre fractionation is an enabling, transformative technology in the development of 'next generation' pulp and paper products. This proposed research program will include an extensive experimental investigation to determine how pulp pressure screen and hydrocyclone design and operation affect the change in fibre property distributions (fibre length, wall thickness and diameter). From the extensive experimental study, a detailed model of the separation process will be developed and implemented into process simulation technology. The model will be based on the fundamental understanding of fibre motion within these unit operations. The resulting simulation will be used to design future multi-stage fractionation systems that will be used throughout the Canadian industry.

     The second project will use multi-stage fractionation to develop pulps with an extremely broad spectrum of properties. Theoretical models will be developed that links the fibre property distributions to the bulk pulp and paper properties by considering the physics at the fibre level. These fundamental models will also be included in the process simulation and used to design highly effective fractionation systems.

     Finally, two demonstration projects will be conducted to demonstrate how current industrial fractionation technology can be used to develop 'next-generation' super-reinforcing softwood pulps and high performance hardwood kraft pulps.

     Enhanced fractionation technology coupled with our diverse Northern fibre has the potential to move the product quality goal-posts of product performance beyond what our southern competitors with their mono-clonal species and uniform growing season can produce. This technology and ability to create 'next-generation' products will provide a lasting, differential advantage to one of Canada's strategically important industries.","Wood, wood products and paper","University of British Columbia",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","M�canique des fluides","M�canique des fluides"
"The pulp and paper industry and associated supplier industries one of the largest net export, strategically important industries in Canada that is facing extreme challenges from higher energy costs, high Canadian dollar and competition from low cost southern producers. Pulp screens and repulpers are key unit operations in the processing of wood into paper and Canada is one of the largest producers of screen cylinders and rotors in the world. This research is aimed at the development of high performance pulp screening and repulping equipment in support of both the Canadian pulp and paper industry as well as the supplier of these systems, Advanced Fiber Technologies Inc. One project will focus on the development of a lightweight, reliable, highly efficient screen cylinder through the development of advanced computational design tools validated through laboratory and pilot experiments. The second project will focus on understanding the mechanisms of screen blinding that limit the capacity of the screen. Through this understanding we will develop new cylinder designs with increased capacity. The third project focuses on the development of a high performance repulper that significantly reduces the energy required to deflake baled and recycled pulp.



The advanced screen design tools will be used to develop high performance pulp processing equipment.  This will provide AFT, a small to medium enterprise that export most of its goods, increased opportunity to innovate and remain competitive.  Furthermore, innovative equipment and process design will initially be trialed and used in the Canadian industry and provide AFT with the ability to help Canadian pulp and paper companies improve the quality and value of the products they produce.","Wood, wood products and paper","University of British Columbia",2,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Syst�mes polyphasiques","M�canique des fluides"

"Funding for the purchase of an imaging ellipsometer is requested. The imaging ellipsometer will be combined with an electrochemical potentiostat/galvanostat apparatus currently operational in the PI's laboratory, thus enabling characterization of (bio)organic, metal/inorganic/polymer (mon)layers/films/coatings on charged and electrically conducting surfaces, and control of the surface potential and surface redox chemistry. The setup will enable research on development of advanced materials for a broad range of applications. 



The imaging ellipsometer will support the following research programs: (i) functionalized surfaces, (ii) electrochemistry, (iii) biomedical engineering, (iv) nanotechnology, (v) gas hydrates, (vi) polymers, and (vii) protein physical chemistry. The imaging ellipsometer will support research programs of at least six researchers in the Faculty of Engineering at McGill, one researcher at the University of Ottawa, and a number of researchers that are members of the McGill Institute for Advanced Materials and Centre for Biorecognition and Biosensors. The setup will also be readily available to other researchers in the Montreal region. 



It is expected that the imaging ellipsometer will support the research of at least 40-45 graduate/undergraduate students and post-doctoral fellows per year. The students/PDFs will gain comprehensive knowledge in materials and surface characterization.

"Coronary artery disease, characterized by a progressive narrowing and blocking of blood vessels, is the leading cause of death in developed countries and accounts for about one fifth of the deaths in Canada. Angioplasty, which is an interventional procedure used for reopening blocked arteries without major surgery, is a common and effective procedure to reestablish blood flow in the blocked arteries. In 80% of cases, a stent is placed in the vessel to keep it open following the balloon angioplasty procedure. Although the stents currently in use are excellent in providing clinical benefits, they have many serious disadvantages resulting from limited biocompatibility, leading to stent blockage and restenosis. This, in turn, leads to a decline in the quality of life of the patient, increased morbidity rate and increased health care costs.  We propose to develop a more compatible coronary stent by modifying the surface of the most commonly used stainless steel stent with an irreversibly immobilized and structurally stable monolayer of the extracellular matrix protein, fibronectin (FN). By controlled engineering of physico-chemical properties of the surface, the immobilized FN will adopt the surface conformation most favorable for endothelial cell-material interactions. We hypothesize that the FN-modified stent will be more biocompatible then stents currently available on the market, which will result in a decreased restenosis rate, improved quality of life of the patient, and decreased health-care costs.  We will use advanced techniques and approaches for nano-structuring of solid surfaces to engineer the stent surface at a nano/molecular level in order to achieve the desired surface bio-physico-chemical properties. We will use a wide range of experimental techniques to investigate these properties, and perform a detailed analysis of the interaction of vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells with the FN-modified surface. Ultimately, we will test the effectiveness of the FN-stent in vivo using an animal model.

"The central theme of the proposed research program is the application of radiation physics to elemental analysis in medical physics and astro-geology.  The program consists of three major initiatives:

1) Measuring Bound Water in Martian Soil Samples

The alpha-particle x-ray spectrometers (APXS) carried on the Mars Exploration Rovers during NASA's 2004/2006 mission have provided elemental analysis of a large number of Martian rock and soil samples.  There are some suggestions that these samples contain salts left behind after the evaporation of large bodies of water, and an advanced version of APXS will be deployed in 2009/2010 to further investigate this hypothesis.  This research project will investigate the sensitivity of indirect detection of light elements in Martian samples based on the observed scatter features present in the APXS spectra.

2)Measuring Silver with X-ray Fluorescence

Occupational exposure to silver can occur in many settings.  Furthermore, there has been a re-emergence of the medicinal use of silver compounds, promoted in alternative medicine. Such exposure can lead to adverse biological effects such as argyria, a permanent skin discoloration. This work will investigate the application of a non-invasive in vivo technique to detect silver in the skin of individuals who are at risk of developing argyria, with the aim of providing a means of intervening before the onset of this irreversible skin condition.

3) Measuring Nitrogen with Gamma-ray Resonance Absorption

The ability to measure nitrogen is a direct means of assessing protein status in many nutritional disorders. The goal of this research is to investigate an alternative approach to the current method, which is problematic.  This new measurement technique has the potential to improve substantially the uniformity and dose of the current method, and would facilitate clinical studies in a number of medical and health-related fields, e.g. nutritional sciences, pediatrics, gerontology, kinesiology and rehabilitation sciences.

"Several researchers in the Department of Biochemistry of the Universit� de Montr�al are investigating important biomolecular complexes. These complexes include protein/protein, protein/RNA, protein/DNA, metal/protein, RNA/RNA and protein/ligand complexes. Formation of these complexes is important for a wide variety of biological processes such as transcriptional or translational regulation, neurobiology, RNA processing, glycolysis, viral infection, and cancer. Specific studies include 1) Messenger RNA transport and localization in mammals; 2) Structural investigation of reaction complexes in Schiff-base forming aldolases; 3) Understanding interactions that mediate the incorporation of Selenocysteine into proteins in mammalian cells; 4) Macromolecular interactions regulating the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II; 5) Structural investigations of RNA / protein interactions; and 6) Structure function studies of the bacterial mercury detoxification pathway. In order to fully understand the factor governing the formation of these biomolecular complexes, it is crucial to be able to thoroughly characterize the folding and binding properties of these biomolecules.  

    )	Fluorescence spectroscopy has become one of the most widely used spectroscopic techniques in the fields of biochemistry and biophysics. The popularity of fluorescence spectroscopy stems from its acute sensitivity to changes in the structural and dynamic properties of biomolecules and biomolecular complexes. Despite this popularity, the Biochemistry Department at the Universit� de Montr�al is not equipped for in-depth biophysical characterization of biomolecules by fluorescence spectroscopy. We are therefore requesting a fluorescent spectrophotometer to fulfill the pressing needs for characterizing biomolecules and biomolecular interactions using state-of-the-art technology and for training students with the latest technology so that they can be competitive on the job market. Detailed characterizations by fluorescence spectroscopy are crucial for understanding key interactions in biological processes, and for the development of new treatments for diseases such as cancer, viral infection and diabetes.

"We are a young research group focused on biological chemistry at Simon Fraser University.  The overall aim of our program is to understand, predict, and control how the structure and dynamics of biological molecules govern their function.  The focus of the proposed research is to link motion (""conformational dynamics"") of unstructured loops in proteins and nucleic acids to the ability of these molecules to recognize their ligands, and to understand how differences in dynamics engender divergent function.  These aims are significant to our mechanistic understanding and eventual targeting of the following systems proposed for investigation: 1) Cryptochromes and photolyases, a pair of structurally homologous but functionally divergent proteins.  Photolyases are DNA repair enzyme that function by flipping damaged bases from the DNA duplex, while cryptochromes have essential, yet poorly understood, functions in human physiology, but are incapable of carrying out this DNA repair.  2) Riboswitches, recently discovered RNA molecules capable of turning genes on and off in response to binding of small molecules.   Our aims are also more broadly significant because we predict that the mechanistic insight will be general.  Thus, with these investigations we hope to better understand how proteins and nucleic acids use sequence-dependent loop dynamics to encode ligand specificity and exchange amongst functionally-specific conformations.

"Our long-term goal is to produce experimental results and theoretical analyses that will yield insight into how visual information from the two eyes is integrated and how this information allows us to interact effectively with objects in our environment.  Our short-term goal is to work on four topics, namely, visual direction, binocular eye movements, motion parallax, and visual stability.  Visual Direction.  We will continue to study how observers judge the directions of objects in the environment with respect to themselves.  This is not as simple a question to answer as one might expect, because we have two eyes.  That is, an object in front of one eye is not in front of the other eye, and the question is how does the brain integrate the information from the two eyes to judge the directions of objects.  Binocular Eye Movements.  We will also continue to study how the two eyes move together.  It has been known for some time that the eyes do not move independently, and we are examining how they move together in both the same direction (e.g., leftward) and in different directions (e.g., inward).  Motion Parallax.  We will also continue to study how movements of the head produce what is referred to as motion parallax and how this information contributes to our perception of depth.  Although early visual scientists were aware of the usefulness of motion parallax as a cue to depth, the details of what information the brain uses have yet to be worked out.  Visual Stability.  We will begin a new research project on how the visual world remains stable when we move our head and eyes.  With every movement of the eyes, images of stationary objects sweep across the retinae.  Despite this, however, the world appears stable.  To date this stability or constancy has been studied primarily under conditions in which the head is held stationary and only the eyes are free to move. The stimulus situation we wish to examine is an extension of this traditional one; namely, we wish to examine perceptual stability when both the head and the eyes are free to move.",Psychology,"York University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Syst�mes sensoriels et perception",Psychologie
"The objectives of this research program are to develop non-invasive sensors and techniques for: (1) continuous monitoring of physiological activities and parameters; and (2) quantitative characterization of biomedical tissues, using piezoelectric and ultrasonic techniques. These objectives will require investigation of optimal sensor design and configuration, design and construction of a signal acquisition system, and development of algorithms and computer programs using digital signal processing techniques to retrieve the desired signals and useful information for monitoring of physiological conditions and medical diagnosis. I will develop a portable and remote continuous health monitoring system based on sophisticated wearable sensor technology, and a robust and advanced quantitative ultrasonic imaging system to assist medical practitioners in making fast, accurate and appropriate diagnosis. These technologies will enable people to live comfortably and healthfully at home.

The monitoring and signal processing can be conducted remotely and therefore the data will be transferred via a wireless connection to a PC, PDA (personal digital assistant), or cell phone.

"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is at the heart of modern chemistry and is widely applicable to other fields in science.  The reason for the importance of magnetic resonance techniques is that they can be used to study, at a molecular level, almost any molecule or extended structure.  Our research group at the King's University College involves undergraduate researchers using magnetic resonance techniques to study the molecular structure and motion of polymers that are important for fuel cells and materials used for gas adsorption. 

 

Many fuel cells rely on polymer membranes which require water to be absorbed in order to function.  Understanding the interactions between the polymer and the water is important in order to improve membrane performance.  We will use special magnetic resonance techniques of deuterated  water to measure the local structure and motion of the molecules.  From this research we hope to provide an understanding of how to improve the performance of polymer membranes for fuel cell applications.



In the drive to develop new gas storage materials for fuels, such as hydrogen, or waist gases, such as carbon dioxide, coordination polymers formed from metal atoms and organic molecules have garnered intense interest. In our group we use experimental and computational magnetic resonance methods to obtain a unique picture of the atomic level structure and motion that plays a crucial role in the gas adsorption properties of these systems.

"While it is true that computing power and information access has increased by orders of magnitude over the last few decades, it is also true that raw human abilities such as our perceptual and motor systems- astonishing as they are- remain effectively similar from one generation to the next.Yet, the common keyboard/ mouse/ monitor trio is hardly playing to the full potential of human motor and perceptual abilities.The significance of this is that for tasks where today's massive amounts of data and computation are involved,the critical bottleneck in many scientific/creative workflows is now the interface itself-- the bandwidth between the human and machine.

As a scientist with extensive professional music experience,I am fascinated by instruments that allow people to perform at an extremely sophisticated level:instruments that require and reward complex cognitive& motor skills and that can be fluidly used to realize sophisticated ideas.I am interested in discovering building blocks of these powerful interaction techniques,and qualities that allow some instruments to be playable in this way.As a computer science researcher I want to create instruments that provide such fluid interaction within the digital realm: tools that let humans naturally drive the immense processing power of today's digital engines to reach their goals and play with their visions more directly.These observations lead to a key question driving my long-term research programme:How do we design interactions in high degree-of-freedom(DOF) audio/ visual/ haptic spaces that allow a user to view and interact effectively with complex data? I explore two different testbeds for data interaction:creating multimedia content and visualizing scientific (aerospace&seismic) data. In both cases,there are shared principles,ideas and techniques for effective and fluid high-DOF interaction,and discovering and identifying these is at the heart of my research.Inasmuch as these are my goals, machine learning algorithms will be a key means of achieving this.Using probabilistic adaptive methods to give the user a wieldy interface over the large complex data sets will be a powerful and practical element of my approach.

"Research in five areas involving convective heat transfer will be undertaken. A number of electronic and electrical components are air-cooled using natural convection and involve geometric shapes that have not been dealt with in basic natural convective heat transfer studies. In the first part of the present work equations that can be used to predict the heat transfer rate in such situations will be developed. Both numerical and experimental studies will be undertaken. In the practical applications considered in the first area of research there is sometimes a low velocity flow over the components. The forced air velocity in such situations is often so low that the heat transfer is by mixed natural and forced convection. Such flows will be considered in the second area of research. Both numerical and experimental work will again be undertaken. The main aims of this work will be to define the conditions under which mixed convection exists. No systematic studies of numerical results obtained using a range of turbulence models for situations involving natural and mixed turbulent convective flows which are similar to air flows in buildings and for which experimental results exist have been undertaken. Such a study will be undertaken in the third study area, the main purpose being to derive recommendations as to which turbulence model to use in a particular flow situation. Most studies of heat transfer across window-blind systems assume that the natural convective flow over the room side of such systems is laminar. Turbulence and unsteady flow can, however, develop in such flows. Therefore in the fourth part of the research basic experimental and numerical studies of the development of turbulent and unsteady flow in window-blind systems will be undertaken. Gas flows in mini-channel systems in which the channel follows a wavy path will be considered in fifth part of the work. Such mini-channel systems are used in a number of practical situations and the flow in these systems can become unsteady at Reynolds numbers that are lower that that at which turbulent flow develops. The purpose of the study is to determine how the channel geometry affects the conditions under which unsteady flow develops.","Energy efficiency","Queen's University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie m�canique","G�nie m�canique"
"This proposal develops new algorithms for the analysis of nonlinear analog circuits, such as, amplifiers, filters, switched capacitor, switched current and oversampled delta-sigma modulators. These circuits are currently used in consumer products, such as, cell phones, telephones and audio equipment. A common method used in the design of these circuits is to simulate them on a computer using specialized software for their analysis. Computer simulation is used because it is cheaper and faster to perform, as compared to fabricating a test circuit. Computer simulation also allows the testing of many what-if scenarios to choose the best design for a given situation. Thus, it is important to analyze or simulate these circuits accurately and with minimum cost.



These circuits can be analyzed by general purpose analog circuit simulators, such as Spice. However, general purpose simulators require considerable execution time, or can not simulate these circuits because they do not take into account the specialized structure of these circuits. The aim of this research is to make use of the specialized structure of these circuits and to provide fast and accurate algorithms for their simulation. The analysis of these circuits will be done in the time and frequency domains, including the calculation of the response, sensitivity, noise and distortion. It will lead to the design of better circuits with higher performance, such as, lower power consumption or higher speed of operation.



Graduate students trained in the analysis and simulation of nonlinear analog circuits will be capable of developing specialized software used in designing high performance circuits used in consumer electronics.

"My research focuses on the structural and dynamical properties of complex fluids, including single-chain polymer systems, Langmuir monolayers, and lipid bilayer membranes.  These polymeric systems have practical applications in thin-film technology and have environmental applications, such as employing biofilms in soil remediation processes (which links well with UPEI's expertise in ecotoxicology).  Additionally, this research has vital biomedical implications.  For example, studies on the coil-globule and globule-solid transitions for isolated polymers in solution are essential to obtain insight into some of the key features that dominate the protein folding process.  In my proposed research, I will use discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations to examine the effects of varying different parameters, including the monomer/solvent size ratio, on both the collapse and freezing transitions for homopolymer and heteropolymer systems.  

   Langmuir monolayers consist of a single layer of surfactants deposited at an air/water interface.  When a monolayer is compressed beyond the equilibrium spreading pressure, the monolayer can collapse through a number of different mechanisms.  In this proposal, I will study how the structure of the solvent affects the stability of the monolayer and attempt to elucidate the driving mechanisms responsible for particular types of collapse phenomena.  These studies are important in understanding the function of lung surfactant monolayers, since this could shed light into the mechanisms responsible for Respiratory Distress Syndrome, a condition occurring in pre-mature infants where there is insufficient surfactant lining the alveoli in the lungs. 

   Lipid rafts are cholesterol rich domains which form in model lipid bilayer and cell membranes due to lateral phase separation.  Studies on raft formation are relevant for understanding processes such as intracellular trafficking, immune response, and synaptic transmission. In this research project, I will investigate how differences in lipid composition affect the shape, size, and the number of domains for binary lipid-lipid/lipid-cholesterol and ternary lipid-lipid-cholesterol systems.

"This proposal adresses some of the difficulties posed by real-world optimization problems. In practice, the regularity assumptions under which optimization algorithms are typically developed may not hold. Elastic methods embed interior-point methods and are effective on problems that do not satisfy a constraint qualification condition, whether they are general nonlinear programs or structured degenerate problems such as mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints and with vanishing constraints. However, little is known about their behavior in the presence of weakly active constraints.



Iteratively solving symmetric saddle-point systems is currently difficult because preconditioning systems must be solved to high accuracy. I seek a cheap constraint preconditioner which may be applied via an iterative method and a loose tolerance. When approximating the (1,1) block with a symmetric positive definite matrix, preconditioning systems are equivalent to weighted least-squares problems. The latter can be interrupted before optimality. I believe that after an appropriate projection, the final iterate may be interpreted as the exact solution corresponding to another preconditioner. I am extracting properties of the latter from geometrical and spectral arguments.



The solution of large-scale optimization systems governed by sets of discretized partial differential equations is challenging because the problem size makes factorizations unrealistic. Instead, matrix free methods must be employed. I am researching the recently-proposed trust funnel method in which linearized constraints are approximately satisfied by means of a new class of projected Krylov methods for unsymmetric augmented systems. I anticipate that it will open new perspectives on large-scale PDE-constrained problems and their efficient solution.

"The central theme of my research program is the functioning of the insect nervous system. We are establishing the mechanisms by which the nervous system communicates; examining hormonal, synaptic, and modulatory mechanisms using neurophysiological, neurochemical, endocrinological, and molecular biological techniques. The questions we are asking are fundamentally important for all nervous systems:  How can a neuron transmit information to a target cell? What types of chemicals act as the transmitters for this information and how are these chemical messages translated by the target cell? How can this information be modulated and coordinated to produce an appropriate behaviour in the animal? In particular we are interested in the role of peptides and amines as neurohormones, released into the blood to co-ordinate activities of diverse groups of cells, and as neuromodulators, modulating the ongoing activities of distinct pathways. We focus on a number of identified peptide families and amines and novel peptides, incorporating multiple techniques in the quest for a complete understanding of the integration and regulation of the appropriate cells.  

In the medically important bug, Rhodnius prolixus, (the vector for Chagas' Disease) we are examining events that occur following a blood meal, including the hormonal control of diuresis and anti-diuresis.  In particular, we are defining the precise input associated with feeding that results in elevations in haemolymph serotonin and diuretic peptides, describing the location and physiological properties of the neurons that release these diuretic and anti-diuretic factors, and the target sites of their neuroactive chemicals (salivary glands, crop, hindgut, Malpighian tubules and epidermal cells).  Progress in this area will be enhanced by the Rhodnius genome project, a project funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute for the Large-Scale Sequencing Network, in response to a White Paper submitted by a consortium, of which I am a member. 

In addition to answering fundamental questions about how the nervous system works, this research also lays the foundation for pest control strategies, targeting neuropeptides as lead compounds.

"Medical image reconstruction is the foundation for medical imaging; without accurate reconstruction, medical images contain errors that make diagnosis difficult or impossible.  Yet, there are many frontiers in medical image reconstruction that are untouched by the field of scientific computing.  This proposal aims at addressing two exciting medical image reconstruction issues, one in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and one in computed tomography (CT).



Intra-echo MRI motion correction looks at ways to use a motion-tracking device with an MR scanner to improve image reconstruction.  Patient motion, such as Parkinsonian tremors, can corrupt the sensitive images that are used to diagnose and analyse ailments like multiple sclerosis, strokes, and other cerebrovascular diseases.  We propose that the intelligent use of motion-tracking data can compensate for that motion.



The second project involves the development of reconstruction methods for portable CT scanners.  Researchers in nanotechnology are working on flexible arrays of x-ray emitters and detectors.  Using these arrays, we forsee a new breed of portable CT scanners that can be deployed right at the scene of an accident.  However, these devices have interesting reconstruction challenges that must be addressed before a prototype can be built.



We propose the use of scientific computing to address these challenges.","Medical equipment and apparatus","University of Waterloo",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Traitement des images","Technologie de l'information"

"The proposed research has as its overarching aim the provision of synthetic solutions to problems of molecular complexity by developing new reactions using molecular rearrangements and the release of ring strain as key design elements.  The approach to these problems will be twofold:  i) we will target complex natural products with important biological properties, and ii) we will develop new complexity generating reactions and demonstrate their utility in complex molecule synthesis.



Specifically, we will develop a synthesis of cortistatin A, an important natural product and potential lead for the development of anticancer-therapeutics.  To carry out this synthesis, a new cascade reaction has been designed to deal with some of the central structural issues present in the target compound.  Successful completion of this work will allow biological evaluation for anti-angiogenic activity (in collaboration with Professor Tara Haas of York University).



In addition, we are interested in developing new complexity generating reactions that make use of sequential molecular rearrangements.  These reactions will provide access to complex polycyclic and acyclic compounds that have wide application in synthesis.

"The proposal is to attain a conceptually-new microwave applicator for use in Microwave-Assisted, Continuous-Flow Organic Synthesis (MACOS), a brand new technology developed in the laboratory of Michael G. Organ at York University in Toronto. The applicator will allow the irradiation of chemical reactions that are flowed through narrow diameter tubes that, in theory, can be of any length necessary to complete the transformation that is being conducted. The tubes being developed by Organ, in conjunction with William J. Pietro, a noted Materials Scientist, are lined with microwave-absorbing material that serve like an antenna to transmit energy to the reaction. In some cases, this has resulted in shortening reaction times literally from days to a matter of seconds! Early-stage MACOS systems are being beta tested in other universities (e.g., the University of Kansas) and in major pharmaceutical companies (e.g., Merck Pharmaceuticals). With the newly designed microwave applicator in hand, the MACOS system will soon be at a stage where it is suitable to engineer into a commercially available system that will be manufactured in Canada for use around the world.

"The research proposed here focuses primarily on two classes of metal-catalysed chemical transformations to produce optically-pure products for which there are no current generally successful and applicable protocols. Optically-pure compounds are utilized in a wide variety of products that our society depends on heavily, such as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. In particular, we have chosen to focus on expanding our investigations in one particular type of metal-catalyst ligand system that we have had tremendous success with over the last few years. N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been applied in catalysis for less than a decade now, but their impact has been huge in the areas of metathesis and cross coupling chemistry. The inventors of metathesis-related transformations have just been awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (2005), and those in the cross coupling area will most certainly be following in the next few years; these reactions have revolutionized synthetic chemistry and are used every day to prepare those societally-important products mentioned above. We have new designs on our own NHC-ligated catalysts, chiral versions, that will allow metathesis and cross coupling to take place in a selective fashion, ideally in a general way so that scientists working around the globe can use them easily and reliably in their search of new chemical entities that advance the health and well-being of our society.

"State-of-the art computational chemistry will be used to study the formation and reactivities of peptide radical cations, PRC.

   PRCs are reactive intermediates which are involved in chemical reactions, associated with radiation, oxidative damage, aging, numerous physiological disorders, and enzyme function. Gaseous PRCs are exploited in mass spectrometry for structural determination of polypeptides. Despite their vital importance, the structures and reactivities of PRCs are largely unexplored; the mechanisms of PRC formation remain unclear.  The formation of gaseous PRCs upon electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) of Cu(II)(L)M complexes (L=auxiliary ligand, M= peptide) will be examined. The reaction mechanism and the factors controlling the barriers to ETD will be predicted and the rules for the selection of a proper L for a given M in order to maximize the yield of a PRC will be deduced. As a next step, a solvent will be added to the system in order to model the formation of PRCs in vivo. The structures and reactivities of PRCs will be examined using the trends which we determined earlier for the chemistry of radical-cationic amino acids, the building blocks of PRCs. The focus will be on spontaneous/low-energy proton migrations and fragmentations. To date, there is no reliable computational method for conformation searching of PRCs. A robust computational technique based on force field and semi-empirical methods will be developed and verified for exploring flat domains on potential energy surfaces of PRCs. Particularly important domains on the potential energy surface will be treated with ab initio molecular dynamics. 

   The proposed research project will generate significant fundamental knowledge and contribute to our overall understanding of electron-transfer processes and reactivities of radical cations, with direct implications to biochemistry and proteomics.

"Early effort estimation is an important part of software project management and has a major impact on a

project's success or failure. Improving size and effort estimation allows managers to determine the

comparative cost of a project, improve process monitoring, and negotiate contracts from a position of

knowledge. Hence, size and effort estimation is one of the most crucial processes for SAP in planning and

managing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) projects. The proposed work addresses an urgent need of SAP

to improve effort estimation in new builds, as imprecise estimates have direct and measurable impact on a

project's costs and success. The research group will apply a novel combination of two research areas, namely

state-of-the art functional size measurement using the COSMIC method and ontology-based natural language

processing (NLP) techniques applied to software requirements documents. A particular attention will be the

automatic analysis of non-functional requirements (NFRs) that can represent more than 50% of the overall

effort, but are currently not systematically captured. To facilitate this work, SAP will provide data and access to

expertise of key personnel to develop, and evaluate our approach. The importance of this work is underlined by

the vital role of SAP's ERP in helping companies around the world in extending their reach of real-time

business processes. A key player of both Montreal's R&D community and the local software industry, SAP

"The overall goal of this research is to provide theory and tools to help users manage access control in complex computer systems.  Access control is the ability provided in a computing system to say who can do what operations on what data.  This research does not involve cryptography, nor does it involve users identifying themselves to a computer system (this is called user authentication).  Access control takes over once the user has been validated to decide what that user is allowed to do, read and write.  In a complex computer environment, this can be a complex management task.

Our research in access control primarily concerns the paradigm of role-based access control (RBAC).  This access control model can be applied to any large, complex system, and can simulate the traditional access control models:  both mandatory access control which is typical of military systems, and discretionary access control which is typically found in commercial database system and operating systems.  As well, complex combinations of access rights can be expressed as roles, which can then be assigned to users or groups of users.

Our more recent research has involved how to administrate complex access control systems, specifically RBAC systems.  The original RBAC models assumed a single ""super-user"" administrator controlling the whole system.  It is more realistic to have a model which allows multiple administrators to manage different aspects of a company's resources.  Our decentralized administrative model is designed to allow for such multiple points of control.  It is even possible for a human resources person to assign users to roles, while a security-knowledgeable person can design the roles and how they are related.

The scientific approach in this type of research is to develop a model, prove properties of the model, and develop prototypes and tools to demonstrate the model.  The main contribution of the research will be a better understanding of what access control mechanisms can express, and how to better use them.  Any technology which helps the user community to better secure its information systems is a valuable contribution.

"Despite great past achievements, Canada faces pressing threats to public health.  While designing appropriate public health policies requires judicious choice of intervention strategies, such choice is complicated by the high complexity associated with the effects of such interventions -- raising the risk that even well-intended policies may prove ineffective or cause worse problems than they solve.

  To enable them to better grapple with these challenges, public health decision makers increasingly turn to simulation models for insight.  By letting decision makers simulate the effects of policies, such models can help inform the design of health interventions that are high leverage, robust, and cost-effective; models also facilitate quicker reaction to an outbreak of infectious disease when it occurs, aid in understanding of health trends, help prioritize data collection, and assist in communication with diverse stakeholders.  Unfortunately, such models are frequently needlessly challenging to build, hard to understand, computationally expensive, and difficult to share and collaboratively explore in a team environment.  There are also growing modeling challenges associated with tackling the many unexplored problems.  

  We propose here to design and apply tools to inform understanding of population health trends and health policy tradeoffs.  On the application side, we seek to continue our collaboration with cross-disciplinary teams to create simulation models to inform the design of health interventions.  In this area, we will specifically focus on investigating novel approaches to modeling challenging and important health concerns, such as obesity and diabetes, and the implications of those conditions for infectious disease spread.  Our work will continue to place a special focus on the Aboriginal Peoples' health. Our methodological work seeks to enhance model performance, thereby opening up more time to carefully investigate policy impacts. We also seek to aid the construction of models that are better designed and more widely shared and understood by building software to improve team access to models and model results, and by supporting improved modeling languages.

"The biggest problem in automatic speech recognition (ASR) is robustness - making sure that ASR models are general enough.  A robust ASR system should be able to decode speech from any speaker, in any reasonable environment.  In practice, speakers other than those that trained the ASR models lead to a significant decrease in ASR accuracy.  As well, environmental noise (e.g., weather, other talkers, cars) and communication distortions (e.g., with mobile phones) degrade ASR performance, often severely.  Even simple microphone substitution reduces accuracy.  Human listeners, in contrast, often can adapt rapidly to all these difficulties, which strongly suggests that major flaws exist in current ASR schemes.  While it is not necessary to directly mimic human perception when designing ASR systems, much of what we know about human speech production and perception has yet to be integrated into practical ASR.  ASR can be greatly improved by better integration of structural information with the current stochastic methodology.

   Over the last 25 years, the ASR field has accepted certain technical procedures as almost de facto standards.  A large majority of ASR divides up speech signals into short blocks of data (called frames, updated typically every 10 ms), does spectral analysis on each frame leading to a set of 10-50 parameters, applies a hidden Markov model (HMM) to decode the speech, and uses a simple language model to help determine the output word sequence.

A collaborative research project will be undertaken by the University of Victoria and ARIA Wind Power Systems, Inc. to investigate flow-induced vibrations in a novel wind turbine for small-scale power generation.

Renewable energy technologies are currently in various stages of maturity. Canadian wind energy industry has grown significantly in recent years, the focus of development being primarily on large utility-scale wind farms. While large wind turbines are generally considered a mature technology, a number of issues remain unresolved in the area of small-scale (up to 300 kW) wind turbines.

One of the most important objectives of wind turbine design is effective control of resonant oscillations. Among these oscillations, acoustic noise that arises due to incoming turbulent flow of air and its interaction with the rotating blades, support structures, and control surfaces plays an important role. In particular, noise generation is one of the most important siting constraints for small wind turbines. Small-scale turbines are more often used for residential power and are likely to be deployed in densely-populated regions. Due to proximity of human activity, these applications could result in substantial noise pollution.

The investigation of the unsteady structures that occur in the air flow around structural components of the turbine will involve application of the state-of-the-art laser diagnostic techniques such as time-resolved digital particle image velocimetry (TR DPFV). In addition, advanced numerical techniques and modeling approaches will be employed to study flow patterns associated with ducted wind turbines and to investigate mechanisms of flow-induced noise generation.

"The proposed research focuses on vortex dynamics and fluid-structure interactions for the case of unsteady separated fluid flow. The goal of the proposed research is to improve understanding of the flow physics in a wide range of engineering and biological systems through application of global, quantitative flow imaging techniques, including particle image velocimetry (PIV). This image-based approach, in conjunction with unsteady pressure measurements and theoretical modelling, will be used to provide fundamental insight and to develop engineering methods of flow control in two specific areas: (1) flow-acoustic coupling and (2) prosthetic heart valves. The following is a brief overview of the objectives for these areas: 

   1. Coupling between hydrodynamic and acoustic phenomena occurs in a wide variety of engineering systems, which involve either gas or liquid as a working fluid. The laboratory configuration used in the proposed research involves a cavity mounted in a duct, which is common in energy systems, including gas transport pipelines and nuclear power plant components. The long-term goal of the investigation is development of an empirical methodology for characterization of the acoustic noise source. The research is expected to lead to development of passive noise control strategy based on modifications of the cavity geometry.

   2. The proposed research will address fluid mechanics aspects of prosthetic heart valves (PHVs). Currently, all mechanical PHV designs suffer from complications resulting from thrombus formation. As a consequence, patients with mechanical valve implants require long-term anti-coagulant treatment. Inherent complexity of the flow geometry, unsteadiness of the flow, and non-Newtonian nature of blood present formidable challenges to the understanding of the physics of fluid-structure interactions and to the evaluation of valve performance. Building upon the recent results, the proposed in-vitro study will employ high-speed stereoscopic PIV to relate flow patterns to clinically relevant parameters such as cardiac output for specific clinical conditions.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","University of Victoria",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie m�canique","G�nie m�canique"
"Space is anything but empty. In addition to the eight planets, there are countless moons and many thousands of asteroids in the inner Solar System, as well as the occasional visiting comet. Dust and small pieces of rock (or meteorites) pass through the Earth's atmosphere every day without notice. Every now and again, however, a larger asteroid or comet may cross paths with the Earth with cataclysmic results. Even ""small"" meteorite impact events can sterilize the Earth's surface for many hundreds of square kilometres. The big events are thankfully less common but are much more destructive. When a 10 kilometre wide asteroid struck what is now the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, 65 million years ago, over half of all species on Earth were wiped out, including the dinosaurs. Many scientists have studied these destructive effects of meteorite impact events. One of the less well-known aspects of impact craters is that they also have hidden benefits. Impact craters can provide warm, wet niches for microbial life and may have even been a place where life may have originated on Earth, and other planets such as Mars. Impact events can also generate economic mineral and hydrocarbon deposits, which is important in a country such as Canada with our strong mining and petroleum industries. The guiding principle of this research program is to investigate these beneficial scientific, social, and economic effects of meteorite impact events, by studying several meteorite impact craters in northern Canada (Alberta, Labrador, Nunavut, and Quebec). I will explore how impact craters can produce: 1) habitats for life on Earth and potentially other planets such as Mars, 2) sedimentary basins that can act as palaeoenvironmental repositories, and 3) economic mineral and hydrocarbon deposits.","Earth sciences","University of Western Ontario",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Sciences des syst�mes terrestres","Sciences de la terre"

"    )	All organisms need to solve the problem of obtaining nutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fats, and other essential substances) from their environment without eating significant amounts of toxins which are often found in various foods. Many plants (and some animals) protect themselves by producing toxins so that they are less likely to be eaten. Mammals, including humans, have evolved a number of ways (poison avoidance system) to reduce exposure to toxins in the foods eaten. Toxins can be avoided on the basis of taste, post-ingestional effects, and learning. We have been using behavioral responses produced when tastants are infused into the mouth (taste reactivity test), to study this poison avoidance system. We can introduce low levels of a toxin (LiCl) into a food (sucrose solution) or inject the toxin after the animal has eaten a food, and examine changes in the rat's behavior as a result of post-ingestive effects of the toxin. Rats can also be made sick by treating them with a bacteria derived compound (lipopolysaccharide) which produces a syndrome of sickness behaviors (reduced interest in eating, drinking, and increased lethargy). We are studying the effects of bacterial infection on the sensitivity of the poison avoidance system. We have some evidence to suggest that bacterial infection sensitizes the toxin avoidance system, or can block food related learning. We are interested in the brain system(s) that control these processes. We are also interested in the effects of exposure to stress on this process of activating and sensitizing the toxin avoidance system. Many patients that are sick because of immune system activation, such as during bacterial or viral infections, are exposed to toxic chemotherapy treatments for other problems (cancer, AIDS) and their eating behaviors may be compromised leading to lower success for the treatments. This research should provide important information to help with this problem.","Advancement of knowledge","University of Western Ontario",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Neurologie du comportement",Psychologie

"There is a strong correlation between the abundance of ozone (O3) in ambient air and respiratory disease. Any process that can accelerate O3 production is thus of importance to public health. There is now growing evidence that halogen chemistry can contribute to photochemical O3 production and negatively impact air quality. However, many key processes that regulate the abundance of reactive halogens in the atmosphere are only marginally understood. The objective of the proposed research is therefore to investigate chemical pathways that lead to production and removal of reactive halogens and halogen precursors in the troposphere (the lowest layer of the atmosphere).

The proposed research involves: (a) Development of new analytical methods for measurement of bromine oxide (BrO) and iodine oxide (IO) by cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) and cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (CEAS), as well as measurement of the halogens Cl2, Br2, BrCl and the halogen precursor ClNO2 by chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS). (b) Investigation of chemical reactions of reactive halogens in laboratory experiments. Yields and rate coefficients of reactions leading to the formation and/or removal of halogens in the atmosphere will be quantified. Of particular interest are heterogeneous inter-conversion reactions, for example reactive uptake of ClNO2 on ammonium sulfate aerosol, and oxidation reactions of IO and BrO with volatile organic compounds (VOCs). (c) Field measurements. We will take some of our instruments out of the laboratory and will measure halogens and halogen precursors directly in the atmosphere. Of particular interest will be the impact of anthropogenic emissions on halogen activation, i.e., conversion of inactive halide anions to photochemically active radical species. Measurements will be compared to chemical models to assess the impact of halogen chemistry on regional air quality.

Overall, the proposed research will greatly contribute to our understanding of the role of reactive halogens in regional air quality.

"These studies focus on the interplay of sensory and motor function in the control of movement and its perception. The long-term goal is to understand how sensory information is integrated in the control of movement and how sensory function on its own contributes to motor learning. The present studies deal in particular with the idea that sensory perception is modified by learning. The studies extend from an assessment of the degree to which somatosensory input related to speech production affects a speaker's sound classification and, more generally, whether speech motor learning warps a speaker's auditory map. Parallel studies of studies of arm movement address the idea that motor learning results in changes to somatosensory function. The studies are linked by a common interest in the sensory basis of motor learning and control and also a common methodology, the use of servo-controlled robotic manipulators to deliver precise mechanical perturbations to the arms or the jaw.

"Populations of organisms that do not freely interbreed can diverge over time.  That divergence could result in speciation-- the process of one species splitting into two that is responsible for the evolution of biodiversity.

    The Arctics are a group of butterflies in the genus Oeneis that inhabit arctic and alpine habitats throughout the northern hemisphere.  Many species in this genus are biennial, meaning that their life cycle requires two years to complete.  If biennialism is obligate and the development of the butterflies always takes two years (with rare exceptions), then even-year populations are temporally isolated from odd-year populations and allochronic speciation could result.

    I will test the concept of allochronic speciation with several species of Oeneis known to be biennial.  A main focus of the research will be on two closely related species, Macoun's Arctic (O. macounii) and the Great Arctic (O. nevadensis).  In eastern Canada, Macoun's Arctics fly as adults only in even-numbered years.  Over most of the west, adults are only known from odd-numbered years, but, at least three populations in the west also occur in even-numbered years, in some cases in the same sites where odd-year populations occur.  The Great Arctic emerges predominantly in even-numbered years, but in some sites odd-year populations are also known.

    I will obtain data from museum specimens to determine the true pattern of adult emergence in these species. Then detailed genetic analyses of specimens collected throughout their ranges (Lake Superior to Vancouver Island) and in even- and odd-years will be conducted.  Genes representing both mitochondrial (maternally inherited) and nuclear (inherited from both parents) DNA will be analyzed. Wing shape (controlled by nuclear genes) will also be assessed using landmark morphometric analyses.  These analyses will allow my students and me to quantify differences resulting from biennialism compared to other causes. The behaviour of marked adults will be studied to determine factors influencing their mating systems.

"My group pursues research in the chemistry of metal ions and is specifically interested in oxidation processes. Industry has a great need for energetically viable and environmentally friendly reactions that convert hydrocarbons, the constituents of oil and natural gas, into useful chemicals. Yet, the direct oxidative transformation of hydrocarbons remains tremendously difficult to achieve in mild conditions. Nature has optimized many such reactions through the use of metal-containing enzymes which operate in environmentally friendly conditions; it is therefore a great source of inspiration for this chemistry. The research goals of my group are thus two-fold: (1) understand the origin of the efficiency of the enzymes, and (2) prepare catalysts that can perform similar reactions. Our initial approach is to model the enzymatic active sites with small metal-containing molecules (called metal complexes) and study their reactivity behaviour. Comparison of the models and the enzymes will inform us on the factors necessary to achieve a strong reactivity. Next, we will implement these factors in metal complexes to perform efficient catalysis. In the short term, this research will provide a better understanding of the toolkit used by nature and how to improve the interaction between a substrate and an oxygen atom bonded to a metal ion. In the long term, our discoveries will guide the design of oxidative hydrocarbon transformations that minimize the number of steps and waste by-products.","Physical sciences","Concordia University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Chimie m�tallique et organo-m�tallique","Chimie inorganique"
"The proposal is to gain infrastructure and ongoing research costs to initiate pre-construction and post-construction research on birds and bat movement around proposed wind farm sites in BC. In 2006, the first wind energy proposals in British Columbia secured power-purchase agreements with BC Hydro, and will be operational by 2009. In 2007, a number of additional sites in the northeastern region of the province are currently undertaking environmental assessments for approval. BC's unique topography and fauna, however, make extrapolation of the effects of other wind farms on aerial wildlife difficult, and this could impede developing this clean energy source. The Centre is a joint venture between researchers at UNBC, Acadia University, and the Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) and industry partners that focuses on developing technologies and conducting on-site research to better understand how aerial wildlife (birds and bats) utilize the airspace and habitat around proposed wind farm sites. This information will be used to reduce the potential for direct (collisions) and indirect (habitat loss, displacement of species from important feeding areas, avoidance behavior) impacts of wind farms. Our goal is to conduct detailed analysis of the movement behaviour of affected wildlife, considering factors such as migrational timing, distance and height of migrants in relation to both landscape and weather patterns. This will be combined with detailed study of the importance of proposed wind farm areas as foraging areas, stop-over points and breeding habitat for migratory species.

Through detailed understanding of wildlife use of these areas prior to construction, we can predict the potential for impacts to be realized, and then work with wind energy producers to minimize these effects. The funding in this grant application will be used to develop high-performance tracking equipment (remotely operated radars with computer interfaces capable of identifying and automatically tracking wildlife targets) to monitor migrating birds and bats. Funding will also be used to support graduate student research that help better define the exact nature of wildlife/wind farm conflicts and mechanisms to reduce these conflicts.

"Human land use has the potential to impact the structure of habitats.  Following logging, regeneration of forests occurs either through natural re-growth or intentional planting, yet these young forests often lack many of the resources found in mature forests.  Such alteration of the landscape may provide relatively poor habitat to birds and other species that settle here.  Further, regenerating forests often differ considerably in tree species from those originally logged.  These 'mosaics' of habitat types often abut one another, creating abrupt zones of contact between species that  typically occupy different forests.  This can lead to cross-species matings (hybridization) between normally habitat-isolated species.  Despite this potential impact, we often overlook how human land use affects the quality of the habitat and the induced interactions this can create among generalist bird species.  

    Our research has focused on two such species, black-capped and mountain chickadees.  We study adjacent populations of chickadees: one group occupying a young forest (20-30 years old) and another occupying a 100 year old mature mixed forest (preferred habitat).  Our results show that birds breeding in the young forest suffer significant costs - they are less likely to successfully breed and are less able to perform energetically demanding displays.  

  Our proposed research will expand on this work by determining how habitat can alter the way these birds are able to communication with one another, as well as the role that climatic variation - such as the increased variability in temperature commonly associated with global warming patterns - can amplify these impacts.  In addition, we will investigate contact between two species that typically occupy divergent forest types - black-capped and mountain chickadees - which now have overlapping populations in parts of northern BC, perhaps due to past logging practices.  Our work will determine whether mechanisms that normally prevent interbreeding among these two species are strengthened or compromised in these secondary zones of contact.

"Biodiversity research seeks to understand the spectrum of biological diversity, its evolution, and its protection through research at all levels, from genes to ecosystems through to interactions with society.  As the scope of global climate change, human-caused habitat alterations, and associated extinction rates rise, the need to understand what generates and maintains biodiversity has never been more pressing.  



    The University of British Columbia's Biodiversity Research Centre proposes to build a premier training program, named Biodiversity Research: Integrative Training & Education (BRITE).  The BRITE program will increase our capacity for training of biodiversity scientists at all levels - undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral.  The innovative nature of the application - allowing for rotations among labs, international travel and collaboration, and internships with partner agencies - will produce a generation of biodiversity scientists who are able to integrate diverse research tools and questions to understand the ecology and evolution of life on earth and to solve one of the most pressing problems of our time:  the rapid loss of species diversity. 



    Scientists trained by BRITE will not only improve our understanding of what generates and maintains biodiversity, but these scientists will also be better equipped to translate this understanding into concrete action - affecting policy, assessing species and ecosystems at risk, developing recovery plans, and guiding Canada toward effective measures to protect our environment and the incredible diversity of life that it supports.

"Plant architecture is highly dependent on the pattern of shoot branching. From an agronomical perspective, the degree of branching is important because it affects the biomass and number of flowers (hence seeds), and in cultivated species it ultimately affects crop yield. Branching is controlled by environmental (e.g. temperature, water availability, photoperiod) and endogenous (hormones and other growth regulators) factors. The plant hormone auxin, which has been studied for decades, is considered the master regulator of branching. Recently, novel growth regulators called strigolactones have been identified. Both auxin and strigolactones are negative signals, meaning that they prevent the growth of lateral buds located on the stem, hence reducing shoot branching. A third class of growth regulators, cytokinins, act as positive regulators and promote branching. It is the ratio between the various hormones that determines if branching will occur. Environmental conditions influence branching, likely because they affect the levels of the different hormones. Our proposed research program aims to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms by which environmental factors influence the hormone-dependent signal transduction pathways that regulate shoot branching in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We will use wild-type and mutant plants that show different levels of branching to determine which of the proteins from three families known to be involved in auxin responses are associated specifically with shoot branching. We will identify and characterize other candidate proteins associated with branching, such as regulators of gene expression. The proposed research program will therefore allow us to identify novel branching-associated proteins and determine how the environmental cues interact with endogenous signals to influence this very important physiological process. The knowledge gained will contribute to our understanding of plant growth determinants and will lead to the development of novel tools to improve plant performance and yield.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Universit� du Qu�bec � Montr�al",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Croissance et d�veloppement des v�g�taux","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres"

"Efficiency Measurement and Benchmarking in Transport/Logistics Sector: 

""How can we increase credibility of efficiency rankings?  How do we make efficiency benchmarking more useful to managers and policy makers? 



This research will focus on improving accuracy and reliability of efficiency measurement and benchmarking applied to transportation infrastructure (airports and seaports) and logistics/supply chain sectors, and thereby, make empirical findings more useful to managers and policy makers. 

We will accomplish this objective by improving methodology and perfecting specification of empirical models applied to airports, seaports and logistics/supply chain industries.  We will compare methodologically and empirically the three key approaches to measuring and analyzing efficiencies: Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Econometric production (cost) function method, and Productivity Index Number approach.  

The methodological issues for research include, but not limited to, the following key topics: (a) improving the ways to incorporate effects of quality attributes of outputs, (b) measuring efficiency in the presence of undesirable outputs such as noise, air pollution, congestion delays, accident risks, (c) incorporating dynamic effects of lumpy capacity investment, (d) incorporating strategic behavior of privatized firms on production and investment decisions, and (e) measuring efficiency at sub-unit levels (branches, department, etc) of a firm in order to provide guidance to management about how to improve efficiency vis-�-vis benchmark firms

In the first stage, in addition to the methodological research, we will focus on empirical work on airports and container ports.  In the second stage, we will expand empirical work to logistics and supply chains, specifically targeting on multinational firms' distribution centers, third-party logistics (3PL) service providers, and efficiency of competing supply chains.

"Micro/nano technology requires compacted devices with extremely high resolution, high accuracy, and a relatively large motion. The equipment tool requested is for the purpose to build an experimental test bed for compliant micro robotic applications were the requirements mentioned above can be achieved. It consists of PZT actuators, PZT amplifiers, AD/DA converter, computer vision system, and Labview RT vision development software. All the hardware and software will be used for the control of a designed spatial compliant micro robotic system. It also can be used to support researches in optimal mechanical design, advanced machining technique, hybrid system development, and system control. 

This equipment is essential and urgently in need for ongoing research projects. It will provide an experimental test base for theoretical verifications on integrated design and control of hybrid macro-micro robotic systems, laser micromachining of 3D MEMS structures, and intelligent learning control systems. In short term, this equipment will support three important ongoing research projects. The first project is towards the development of hybrid macro-micro robotic systems that focuses on the reduction of the interaction between a micro robotic system and a macro counterpart. The requested equipment tool is one of the key subsystems of the integrated hybrid system. The second project focuses on the development of new laser material processing techniques where a high precision micro workstation with high degree of flexibility is essential. The requested equipment tool will be used to facilitate the laser 3D micro fabrication. The third project is to develop intelligent learning control systems for micro manipulations driven by PZT actuators. The tool will be used to test the developed intelligent control systems and verify the effectiveness of compensating hysteresis of PZT actuators.

These research projects have great significances to Canada in developing new micro robotic systems and machining high accurate micro products. The long term significance lies in the added value created by the developed hybrid macro-micro systems and the advanced material process techniques.

"The conventional paradigm to cope with the challenge to further improve performances and reduce costs of mechatronic systems is to have different technologies brought together to meet different requirements. This approach may come to a limit as each technology has a side effect with respect to others. Hybridization of engineering system, a new paradigm developed by the PI, may bring some promise in that it learns from biological systems hybridization - with an emphasis on the complementary behaviour of two technologies or systems to be integrated in terms of their strength and weakness. The long-term goal of this research program is to develop a general hybrid macro-micro robotic system (HMMRS) technology with an important characteristic that is large workspace with high accurate end-effector positioning. The methodology includes the integrated design of micro motion system and macro motion system to reduce or eliminate their interaction, and the design for control method to facilitate control system design. 

There are three general research issues in the development of the HMMRS technology. The first issue is about the architecture of the HMMRS. A parallel or hybrid architecture of the system will be sought for to bring macro-scale and micro-scale systems together through a further hybridization refining process. The second issue is about the technology to implement the architecture of the HMMRS. The key consideration is to eliminate the interaction between two robotic systems through proper design process for both mechanical and control systems. The third issue is to apply the HMMRS technology to the aircraft inspection in order to further optimize the inspection performance where the inspection area is very large while the target feature to be inspected is very small. The successful application provides a validation of the HMMRS technology.  

This research program will make significant contributions to the field of macro-micro robotic systems technology for the enhanced performance such as long motion range, high accuracy, and high robustness. It will provide a new way of developing the architecture and the control system for the HMMRS.

Since their accidental discovery in the late 1960s, Gamma-ray bursts remain today the most outstanding puzzle in astrophysics. In a few seconds, they release more energy than the sun will emit in its entire 10 billion years of life making them the most luminous objects in the Universe. These bursts of photons from the highest part of the electromagnetic spectrum were found to originate from the deepest confines of space near the outer reaches of the observable universe (on the order of 3 billion to 10 billion light-years away). Every day these powerful explosions illuminate the sky, coming from apparently random directions. They are the most short-lived energetic events in the universe, flashing and fading in a matter of seconds. They pass too quickly to aim a telescope for follow-up observations and one can only listen to the echo, the so-called afterglow  (the X-ray and optical fading parts of the main burst). A central problem contributing to the Gamma-ray bursts mystery  is the unknown nature of the engine  powering them.



The goal of the research project is to investigate theoretically and numerically (using state-of-the-art codes) the fate and the behavior of matter around black holes, quark stars and neutron stars.  We hope to isolate mechanisms which could generate gamma-ray explosions (bursts) and compare them to observations. In doing so, we should be able to suggest which  of these two types of compact stars (black-holes and neutron stars) is the likely candidate for driving the gamma-ray bursts .

"Our research examines an important transfer of genetic information that occurs between the mother's egg and the developing embryo.  Before fertilization, the egg undergoes a process called oogenesis.  The oocyte, which eventually becomes the egg, is a highly specialized single cell of the female germline that carries out certain processes, quite different that those of sperm, for the purposes of reproduction.  The oocyte expresses a large amount of genes from the maternal genome of the mother that get passed onto the next generation embryo.  The embryo receives genetic information from both male (sperm) and female (egg). However, in oocytes, there is a key difference in the normal information transfer process of cellular gene expression that usually involves trancription of DNA information in genes into messenger RNA molecules, and subsequent translation into proteins that carry out the bulk of cellular processes.  In oocyes, many genes are expressed as RNA molecules but they are stored for very long periods and not released for translation until after fertilization in the embryo (thus, the mother's genes are expressed as proteins in the offspring).  It has been known for over 20 years that maternal RNAs are stored in multi-protein storage particles called mRNPs, however very little is known about how mRNPs are assembled, the proteins and mRNAs of which they are composed, and the mechanisms by which certain RNAs are selectively translated into proteins in the embryo.  We examine this, focussing on a protein called YY1, that we identified as a novel mRNP protein.  We use frog oocytes and embryos as a model system to examine the basic biology of mRNPs with hope of advancing our knowledge of the fundamental processes of life.  Specific aims: A variety of biochemical and molecular techniques will be employed to determine how YY1 interacts with RNAs in YY1-mRNP complexes, what RNAs and other proteins are in these complexes, what is the actual function of YY1 in mRNPs and what role it plays in the mechanism of development.

"In order to be more competitive, Canadian manufacturing has utilized robots to increase productivity. To further increase the competitive advantage, the use of two-armed manipulator systems is a valid option. The advantage that two-armed systems have over a single manipulator is a further increase in productivity, improved dexterity and reachability, and a larger workspace. 



This research project will investigate the issues with robotic machining and will develop novel solutions that will allow robotic machining to be a valid alternative to Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) machining. The first robotic machining systems were essentially rapid prototyping systems where soft materials such as wood, wax, or foam type materials were machined. Machining harder materials was problematic due to the cantilevered design of serial link manipulators and the low torsional stiffness of the actuators. Excessive bending and vibrations can occur which is detrimental to the tool and workpiece. Furthermore, robotic manipulators lack the precision that can be obtained with CNC machines. Despite these drawbacks, there has been a progression to use robotic manipulators for machining soft metals like aluminum. 



The operational limits of manipulators for robotic machining applications will be investigated and quantified.  Once the operational limits are determined, a two-armed manipulator system will be used for a machining task.

"Wildfire events have a significant and measurable impact on the sediment dynamics of forested catchments over wide spatial and temporal scales. This project will determine the response of sediment sources and evaluate sediment (mineral and organic) redistribution through aquatic systems due to wildfires in northern interior forest environments in Canada over contrasting spatial and temporal scales. A successful feasibility study in 2004 indicated that the sediment system in one of the study catchments to be investigated is responding to wildfire disturbance, as evidenced by changing sediment sources and sediment fluxes following a wildfire. The present project will apply a suite of integrated techniques to link contemporary responses to long term recovery from wildfire disturbance. Specifically, a field sampling and laboratory programme will be undertaken comprising three interlinked parts: (a) measurement and sampling on a hillslope unit before and after a prescribed (i.e. induced) burn, (b) a paired-catchment comparative study (i.e. a naturally burnt catchment and a nearby unburnt catchment with similar characteristics) and (c) a palaeolimnological study exploring changes in deposited sediment properties in lake catchments with known fire histories. Work will be undertaken in study areas of contrasting spatial scale (hillslope to catchment) and fire history (present, recent, decades and centuries). The results of these will be utilised to understand the response of catchments to fire in order to link short-term process knowledge with longer term data on sedimentary processes, in order to provide tools for investigating scenarios of potential impacts of burning in forests.  



It is envisaged that the findings of this work will have worldwide interest and relevance, and will enable environmental scientists to examine how forested river systems respond to wildfire events. In addition, the findings will provide valuable information for the present and future management of forest systems.

"The overriding hypothesis of this research is that the mechanism of spinal cord injury is critical to the type of damage produced and thus is an important factor that should be incorporated in clinical decision-making.

Our major progress over the past several years has highlighted several biomechanical issues that we will explore in the current proposal. Our specific objectives are i) to document the cord deformation patterns that occur in clinically relevant conditions and ii) to simulate patterns of spinal cord damage under these deformation patterns using the finite element method. To address the first specific objective, clinically relevant injuries of will be produced in our novel experimental model at high rates of loading (~1m/s). We will address contusion, fracture-dislocation, and flexion-distraction injuries. During the impact event, the deformation patterns of the spinal column and spinal cord will be monitored using our custom designed high-speed Xray system, which is capable of recording at 1,000 frames per second. To address our second objective, the dynamic cord deformations from the experimental studies will be input to our spinal cord model and the degree of primary damage to the cord tissue will be predicted. The main task involved with the second objective will be to refine our current three-vertebra cervical spine finite element model. Sensitivity studies will be conducted to guide us in this development. Our current strategy is to model the cord structure as a bulk material but the complexity of the problem may force us, in the future, to develop a more anatomically accurate microstructural model of the cord. The accuracy with which we can predict tissue damage patterns in the cord will guide this

research. It is anticipated that the main application area for the research will be in the acute stages of clinical treatment, particularly in the technique and timing of surgical intervention as well as the application of  repair/regeneration strategies in this acute setting. Ultimate success of the research will be realized in future clinical translation of the novel methods that demonstrates enhanced outcome for spinal cord injured individuals.

"Experimenters are often searching for the values of input variables that will provide the optimal yield in a process. In most cases, the number of input variables are many and the system can be represented by nonlinear models. In some situations it may be possible to guess the structure of the nonlinear function needed to represent the system to some degree of accuracy. However, in many cases the function may be unknown. It turns out that if little or nothing is known about the structure of the nonlinearity in a system, it has been found that a class of functions known as wavelets can be used to model the nonlinearity very closely for the purpose of analysis, prediction and inference. We intend to exploit this flexible property of wavelets to construct designs for nonlinear systems. Our goal is to focus on systems in which there are more than one input variable. Furthermore, in longitudinal time series, the variance of the series may vary from subject to subject or the variance of the series from a group of subjects may differ from the variance of the other groups. In addition, each of the series may also have a trend component which may not be the same across the entire data. Before analyzing the longitudinal data, it is then important to know if (i) the variance of each of the series is the same, and (ii) it is safe to assume that the trend component is the same for the series from each subject, in the presence of the correlation structure within each series. Our goal is to develop wavelet based procedures for assessing the nature of the nonstationarity in the mean of each series and determining if it is the same across several time series in a longitudinal set up. Our approach will take into account the correlation structure of each series. This will then have an impact on how tests for equality of variances across these time series will be performed. To our knowledge, current methods have assumed that the trend in each of the series is the same. Our objective is to extend these results to the case where the trend may defer from series to series. The proposed research is useful in design construction and in medical research, plant physiology and animal growth curves - areas in which the problem of comparison of curves frequently arise.

"The project develops the signal processing and control technologies required for small (less than 35 kg) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to satisfy new Transport Canada regulations to operate in non-segregated (civilian) airspace.  The end product is a sense-and-avoid payload based on optical and infra-red sensors for the deconfliction of non-cooperative general aviation (GA) traffic under visual meteorological condition (VMC). 



With the assistance of Provincial Aerospace Limited, the project makes the transition from experimental deployments into full mission flight testing at the newly-established UAV test centres in Clarenville in Central Newfoundland and Goose Bay in Labrador.  It builds on the capacities, created under RAVEN I, an existing UAV R&D program at Memorial University, in software simulation, mission management, data communications, and sensor systems.  It will also leverage on RAVEN II, a recently funded $3 million project supported under Round 5 of the Atlantic Innovation Funds, providing the vital air vehicle test platforms, engineering support and UAV test facilities to ensure the success of the research components under proposed the DND-RPA program.



The project addresses DND priority areas in air vehicle, surveillance system and human-system interaction and will provide an end-to-end dual-use solution for enhancing safety and reliability in deploying small UAVs for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions.  It will also position Canada as a global leader in the integration of small UAVs into non-segregated airspace.

"Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that share a distinct type of optic nerve damage that can lead to blindness. The prevalence of glaucoma increases markedly with age. A major difficulty of this disease is that most people who have glaucoma do not notice any symptoms until they begin to lose substantial segments of their visual field. This visual loss is permanent. The World Health Organization estimates that there are 13.5 million people with glaucoma worldwide. Currently, about 300,000 Canadians are diagnosed with glaucoma. It is estimated that another 150,000 Canadians have glaucoma but remain undiagnosed.

Our recent studies suggest that the biomechanical compliance of the lamina cribrosa differs dramatically between patients with rapidly deteriorating glaucoma and patients with stable glaucoma. The lamina cribrosa is the porous disc of specialized sclera through which the axons composing the optic nerve leave the eye and many of the capillaries and blood vessels feeding the eye enter. Our static measurements show that the displacement of the lamina cribrosa of high-risk patients is more than 10 times larger than those of low-risk patients. This finding suggests that the lamina of high-risk patients is less rigid and thus has a larger pulsation, resulting in larger damage to the axons and the rapid progression of glaucoma. However, there is presently no equipment that can measure this pulsatility.

TTie objective of this project is to develop a device that can measure the pulsatility of the lamina cribrosa, for early diagnosis of high-risk glaucoma. The device should have micron spatial resolution and millisecond temporal resolution. A major advantage of this device is that it will be able to perform measurements within a reasonably short time, and with high accessibility (no need to take medicine or have ocular surgery to reduce long-term intraocular pressure). As a result, individuals that have high-risk for glaucoma can be identified before loss of vision starts, benefiting the health of Canadians, and preventing the low quality-of-life and high costs related to glaucoma

"Owing largely to the incredible advances in ultrafast laser technology, intense laser-matter interaction and nonlinear optics have had significant impact on present-day science and technology. Using nonlinear optical phenomena, scientists can now perform sub-micron resolution imaging of live tissue, and can even image the structure of molecules with atomic spatial resolution. Many of these techniques are made available using near-infrared Ti:sapphire laser technology (with central wavelength at 800 nm). However, the world of photons is full of much more color. In fact, the applicant's group has developed various intense light sources at unconventional wavelengths (from X-rays to Terahertz (extreme far-infrared) radiation), making full use of the unique lasers available at the Advanced Laser Light Source of the INRS. These intense X-ray and Terahertz (THz) sources are now powerful enough to explore nonlinear optics at these new wavelengths. 



In this Discovery program, we propose to study and harness strong field interactions and nonlinear optics over an extremely wide spectrum, using our intense light sources (from X-rays to THz). The goal is to study the nonlinear optical response of matter to these intense X-ray and THz radiation, to gain knowledge that is not accessible with nonlinear optics using conventional laser sources. For example, it was recently demonstrated that femtosecond near-infrared lasers could inactivate several types of viruses, which protect themselves with coatings called capsids. The mechanism is attributed to the excitation of resonant vibrational modes (at sub-THz frequencies) and the subsequent rupture of viral capsids, by the near-infrared laser. Therefore, we will irradiate such viruses with our intense THz radiation, whose nonlinear optical response may unveil new knowledge that could be used to battle viral diseases, such as HIV and flu. The intense X-ray sources will be used to excite collective electron motion (plasmon) in complex molecules (such as fullerenes), whose knowledge is fundamental in understanding many phenomena in chemistry and biology.

"Canadian groups have developed a unique perspective for molecular imaging based on combining major advances in ultrafast science. As a result, we have established a Canadian based International Research Facility that is exploring a completely new approach to dynamic investigation of matter. This major research resource, called the Advanced Laser Light Source (ALLS), is enabling the combination of any or all of the most advanced laser technologies for exploiting light-matter interactions. 



ALLS aims to be accessible to the scientific community at large. The ALLS project brings together Canadian institutions and researchers involved in ultrafast lasers, technologies, and applications. The facility was launched in April 2003, and made open to users in September 2005 starting with two laser beam lines available. It will be fully operational, with a maximum of four beam lines available in January 2008. The Canadian users' projects at ALLS, many of which started in September 2005, are regrouping 33 Canadian faculty professors and 7 senior researchers from governmental laboratories (4 are also adjunct faculty members at Canadian Universities), distributed among 18 institutions from 4 provinces. During the first two years of operation, there has already been several important research results emerging from ALLS experiments, and new national and international collaborations lead by key Canadian researchers have materialized from the various ALLS projects.



ALLS is not duplicating already existing tools but is rather opening new specific niches for Canadian research on ultrafast lasers and their applications. The ALLS initiative is providing the right platform to integrate and fully transfer small-scale feasibility experiments to full-scale exploitation experiments.

"Pea (Pisum sativum L.) is a model dicotyledonous species for studying the coordination of organ development; specifically, the role of seeds during fruit growth and the interplay between the embryos axis and cotyledons during early seedling growth.  In both developmental processes, the normal growth and development of one tissue is dependent on the associated tissue (the seeds are required for pericarp growth and the cotyledons are required for embryo axis growth).  Using data from our experimental systems, we have developed working hypotheses on the role of plant hormones in the coordination of growth and development between these tissues.  In the fruit, our data suggest that the seed-derived auxin, 4-Cl-IAA, is transported to the pericarp where it stimulates gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis and thereby growth. In the germinating seedling, we found that the embryo axis is required for stimulation of GA biosynthesis in the cotyledons.  In both systems, our work is pioneering in the field and has lead to the development of unique working hypotheses to explain the role of hormones in coordination of tissue growth and development.

This work is novel, the fruit system being one of the few examples of one plant hormone specifically affecting the synthesis of another hormone, and it is the first molecular report of how auxins can regulate GA levels and thereby plant growth.  In the seedling system, this is the first report of the embryo axis regulating GA biosynthesis in the cotyledonary tissue.  Accomplishment of this work will identify mechanisms by which plant tissues communicate using hormonal signals to coordinate and regulate growth.  This body of knowledge, in turn, could have substantial impact on progress in solving problems of significant economic importance pertaining to fruit growth and development, and seedling establishment.

"This proposal covers distributed data management issues in two increasingly important domains: XML query processing and data stream systems.

- Distributed XML query processing: XML has emerged as the de-facto standard for publishing and exchanging data of many different types. While extensive research has been conducted on efficiently querying XML data in a wide range of settings, these have primarily focused on data that reside on a single machine (i.e., centralized). This has two potential problems. On the one hand the solutions may not be scalable to very large XML databases, while on the other hand, these approaches do not address the necessity to query and retrieve existing XML data that may already be distributed. In this research we will study distributed XML query processing in two main environments: (1) when there is some control over where the XML data can be placed (i.e., tightly controlled distribution), and (2) when data are already distributed (i.e., the data integration scenario). 

- Mining data streams: A data stream is a real-time, continuous, ordered (implicitly by arrival time or explicitly by timestamp) sequence of items. The particular problem that will be studied is the mining of data streams with distribution changes (i.e., ""dynamic data streams""). Traditional data mining assumes that data are entirely stored on disk, and almost all traditional mining algorithms require scanning the data multiple times. Neither of these assumptions hold in the case of streaming data. ""Distribution change"" refers to changes over time in the underlying statistical distribution of the data. For dynamic data streams, mining results generated in the past may not be relevant as time progresses. However, since data can be looked at only once, historical data are no longer available, and, thus, it is even hard to just determine the change point of the underlying distribution, let alone updating mining results to fit the new data. We will perform a systematic study of the problem focusing on effective (and statistically meaningful) detection of distribution changes and online mining algorithms to cope with these changes.

"Therapeutic agents interact with a variety of physiological molecules in the human body; their overall biological effect is determined by the combination of these interactions.  The proposed research program will focus on drug-protein interactions, as proteins are often the targets of drugs, and may serve as their transporters or receptors. 



More specifically, the short-term objective of the research program is to gain deep understanding of the interaction of a widely used anticancer agent (paclitaxel, trade name: Taxol) and a plasma protein (human serum albumin).  This interaction is not only important for the transport of paclitaxel but is also of particular interest as albumin is known to be taken up by tumours at an increased rate in comparison to normal tissue.  A powerful combination of computational and experimental methods (including cutting-edge technology based on surface plasmon resonance) will be used to explore the mechanism of the interaction, to identify the primary drug binding site on the protein, and to reveal how this interaction affects the binding of physiological ligands (such as long-chain fatty acids) and other drugs to albumin.  The long-term objective of the research program is to tackle the challenge of exploring the interaction of anticancer drug-albumin complexes with albumin binding proteins and with receptors on the surface of tumour cells.



Fundamental understanding of biomolecular interactions will lead to new therapeutics with greatly improved characteristics that will benefit the public in and outside Canada.  The new knowledge generated through successful accomplishment of the short- and long-term objectives is expected to prompt research activities in protein chemistry and related fields, and thereby contribute to their advancement.  Participation in the research program will provide excellent interdisciplinary training opportunities for future scientists.

"My research interests have as their focus the field of self-assembly at solid surfaces.  Advances in experimental techniques have allowed scientists to investigate self-assembly at the level of individual molecules.  These investigations have provided the answers to many important questions, and brought to light the existence of new and interesting questions.  Gaining a thorough understanding, and therefore raising the possibility of controlling self-assembly phenomena is a problem of central importance in the bottom-up approach to nanotechnology. Many of the difficulties in developing a clear-cut picture of the structures emerging during self-assembly are due to the complexity of the systems.  These systems possess many degrees of freedom (they can come together in many different ways) and many competing interactions which combine to produce a large diversity of final results.  One way to get to a global picture of self-assembly mechanisms is to separate systems into smaller, relatively independent domains which can be analyzed individually.

I will develop a research program aimed at isolating and investigating fundamental aspects of self-assembly, with a focus on the effect the molecular environment (solvent, surface, cooperative effects) has on the emerging structures.  Some of the research will involve chiral separation on solid surfaces, but many of our results will be more generally applicable.

A second research direction involves the assembly and electro-optical properties of nanocomposites, with an emphasis on metal/semiconductor--polymer nanocomposites. These materials show promise for use in a variety of applications, for example, as dielectrics in field-effect transistors and supercapacitors, and as fiber-optic materials.  These are complex systems, and theoretical investigations of their assembly and properties are difficult to perform using current simulation methods.  I will expand the current understanding of the role of the molecular environment on self-assembly while creating better simulation methods, develop user-friendly computer packages, and train young scientists in an array of theoretical methods.

"We make rapid eye movements called saccades several times per second.  Saccades are useful for scanning one's surroundings and for improving the sensitivity of visual processing.  Despite the frequency of saccadic eye movements and their effects on the visual input, we generally perceive the world to be quite stable.  That is, the eye movements that frequently alter the visual input do not disrupt our ability to process visual information.  This stability is thought to be the result of neural mechanisms that combine visual input with motor signals related to the metrics of each saccadic eye movement.  To understand how these mechanisms work, the research described in this proposal will focus on visual perception during tasks that require saccadic eye movements.

     Our laboratory will use behavioural experiments to determine how subjects process visual information around the time that they make a saccadic eye movement.  In particular, we will ask how the saccade affects the accuracy and precision of visual processing, and how visual processing affects the accuracy of saccadic eye movements.  The results from these behavioural studies will be combined with electrophysiological studies that monitor the activity of neurons that are involved in eye movements and visual perception.  By combining perceptual and electrophysiological studies, we will deepen our understanding of the relationship between neuronal events and mental events, which will be important in understanding how the brain functions when it works properly and exactly what goes wrong when it does not.","Medical and health sciences","McGill University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Syst�mes sensoriels -- vue",Psychologie

"We request  a  Cantisens Research  Cantilever Sensor Array System to support our long-term and short-term  objectives of understanding and quantifying the microfluidic - structural interactions in a closed environment on micro-nano cantilever based systems.   We rely on using this equipment as a crucial equipment tool to characterize the microfluidic-structural interactions and also to support the research thesis work of many of our graduate students who have started their research in this area.  We believe that understanding of microfluidic-structural interactions is very fundamental and critical to the realization of micro or micro-nano integrated devices for biological, cellular and chemical studies involving fluids. This study becomes essential and complementary for our engineers working in the areas of microsystems, microfluidics, dynamics under fluidic environment, application of micro-nano integrated systems for bio and chemical applications, and for our biologists working in characterizing cellular and molecular interactions using microstructures.  This equipment will facilitate even the in vitro characterization of bio interactions at cellular levels. As the test will be conducted in a closed microfluidic environment, we will be able to carry out the experiments in the native environments needed for the applications.   We will use this equipment to (i) study static and dynamic behaviour of micro or micro-nano integrated structures under closed microfluidic environment (ii) quantify the effect of fluid properties on device performance (iii) study the bio-mechanical interaction at molecular and cellular levels in in-vitro and closed environments (iv) conduct visual study on microfluidic-bio-structural interactions (v) study the influence of temperature dependent properties.

"Bio-security and Point-of-Care Testing (POCT) for health monitoring and diagnosis are the needs of the hour for rapid detection of biological and chemical species, and essential for various medical applications. This calls for a necessity to develop a cost effective Microsystems capable of rapid in-situ detection of biological elements. Integrated microsystems provide an answer to the problems of rapid pathogenic detections by integrating optics with biology. However, there are some critical issues which are associated with biophotonics such as miniaturization, portability etc. The portability of the device is required for in-situ medical detections while miniaturization of the biosensor is essential for handling smaller sample volumes in order to achieve high throughput. Both these conditions cannot be satisfied unless a technology to integrate microsystems is developed. Hence, the field of integrated Optical and Bio Mircrosystems has vast potential for drug delivery, medical diagnosis, lab-on-a-chip, biodefense, biosensors, point-of-care diagnostic applications, therapeutic micro/nano technologies, microarrays and biochips, protein arrays, bioassays, etc. that would benefit  the society enormously. 



With the recent surge on the requirement for the national security, there is a demand for sensors and other devices for high volume, low cost and multi-domain needs and this makes the present proposal of developing integrated Optical and Bio Mircrosystems on silicon and polymer platforms, highly relevant to the present state of technological need. The objective of realizing low cost, efficient and reliable Integrated Microsystems for various applications through systematic analytical and experimental research will definitely exchange the knowledge on  many multi-disciplinary areas such as BioMEMS, microfabrication, microphotonics, Optical MEMS, micromechanics, bio sensing, microfluidics, etc.

"Complexity science is a branch of physics devoted to attacking the ""complexity wall"". This wall springs from an ongoing explosion of empirical data, giving detailed information about states of a system, including its (noisy) time evolution.  The data results from spectacular advances  in experimental techniques as well as information technology. Prime examples include high-throughput methods to define the regulatory dynamics of a cell, microtick data on agents' actions in markets or dynamic resource allocation in the internet, or even digital image sequences with high spatial and temporal resolution.   Breaking  through the complexity wall, and using this knowledge to better the human condition, depends upon improving methods to analyze micro-level data  together with discovering high level, but falsifiable concepts that organize data and parametrize models in meaningful ways.  This is precisely where methods, tools and models of statistical physics have proven indispensable as a part of efforts between specialists in different fields to solve today's outstanding problems.

 

This year I joined the University of Calgary to head a new Complexity Science Group, which now includes two faculty, one adjunct and one visiting (i-CORE) Professor. This NSERC discovery grant proposal will support my research in three interdisciplinary target areas. These areas are crucial to advancing the field, as well as founded on  developing strengths in the group and its collaborations to link theory to leading edge experimental data and advances in technology. My target areas are: (1) Distributed Information Networks with application to improving protocols and design for peer-to-peer networks,  e-Science or global computing, (2) Structure of Complex Networks with the goal of detecting meaningful structures in biological networks such as regulatory or protein interaction networks, and (3) Complex Dynamical Systems - including theoretical studies of  far from equilibrium phenomena  such as self-organized criticality - in biology, econophysics, geophysics and astrophysics.

"We request a fluorescence spectrophotometer that will be of great resource to a broad range of biochemistry laboratories at SFU.  This new instrument will relieve pressure from an older model overburdened Cary instrument found in the Chemistry Department and make possible experiments currently outside of the current instrument's sensitivity, temperature range and speed of data acquisition.  We will be using this instrument to: perform enzyme kinetics studies on antibiotic and antiviral targets (Paetzel Lab); to evaluate cardiac troponin c protein interaction (Tibbits Lab); to investigate the ability of intact double helical DNAs to recognize homology under conditions of molecular crowding (Sen Lab); to characterize RNA aptamers against dyes that become strongly florescent upon rigidification  (Unrau Lab); to characterize the protein complexes involved in apoptosis and cancer (Pio Lab); and to test for conformational changes in receptor proteins (Young Lab). In addition, many other research labs in various Departments at SFU will have access to the instrument (MBB, Chemistry, Biology, Kinesiology, Faculty of Health Sciences) under the supervision and training of experienced spectroscopists.  The sensitivity, accuracy and speed of data acquisition from this new instrument will be a great benefit to laboratories at SFU and will play an important role in the development of new antibiotics, new antivial drugs, new medications and treatments for congenital heart disease, cancer and many other diseases, as well as facilitating the development of real time biological tracking methodologies and nanotechnology devices.  Our research fields and Canada in general will benefit greatly from the acquisition of this instrument, it will make possible experiments that will elucidate the kinetics, dynamics, and structure of medically and scientifically important biological macromolecules.

"The objectives of the proposed research program is to investigate the structural and mechanistic details of two unrelated families of proteolytic enzymes (one bacterial and one viral) that have evolved the same unusual catalytic mechanism. These proteases; bacterial signal peptidase and viral VP4 protease both utilize an essential lysine and serine in their hydrolytic reactions. The deprotonated lysine is thought to serve as the general-base by abstracting the proton from the serine hydroxyl thereby activating it for nucleophilic attack on the scissile carbonyl of the substrate.

Signal peptidase is an essential bacterial enzyme that functions to release secreted proteins from the cell membrane and is being investigated by a number of pharmaceutical companies as a novel antibacterial target.  VP4 protease is involved in the proteolytic processing of viral coat proteins in birnavirus, the infectious agent that costs the fish farming and agricultural industry billions of dollars of lost revenue each year. We will use; molecular biology, protein chemistry, X-ray crystallography, enzyme kinetics, and Nucleur Magnetic Resonance to investigate the structural and mechanistic similarities and difference in these two enzymes families in order to provide a more detailed understanding of how the Ser/Lys dyad mechanism works, and how enzymes work in general. 

Canada will benefit socially and financially from the commercialized drugs that result from the structure-based rational antibacterial and antiviral drug design efforts on these enzymes.  Canada will also benefit from the training of highly qualifies personnel in our lab. Students and post-doctoral fellows are becoming structural biologist (highly sought after in both academics and industry) with skills in molecular biology, protein chemistry and X-ray crystallography.

"The objectives of the proposed research program are to gain significant new knowledge of gravitational theory and quantum gravity and their implications for the universe as a whole, for black holes, and for other structures within the universe.  In cosmology, my main goal is to make progress toward solving the measure problem, the problem of how to make predictions for the probabilities of observations in universes that have inflated so large that nearly all possible observations are almost certain to occur somewhere.  I have shown that this problem is logically independent of the rules of standard quantum theory, so new rules are needed.  I have also found that many attempted solutions to the measure problem predict the absurd result that we are most likely Boltzmann brains, highly disordered observers that would form by thermal or vacuum fluctuations rather than by biological evolution and natural selection.  I plan to investigate ideas I have for solving the measure problem and for avoiding the Boltzmann brain catastrophe, such as measures that do not give higher probabilities to larger volumes of space that would give preference to future epochs when Boltzmann brains would dominate.

     In the area of black holes, I have collaborated in finding the solutions to Einstein's equations for general rotating black holes in higher dimensions in the presence of dark energy, and in finding that particle motion around these black holes is not chaotic.  I plan to pursue the problem of simplifying the equations for gravitational waves moving near these black holes, which will greatly help calculations of how much energy may be carried off by such waves by Hawking radiation if such black holes can be produced in particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

     There are also many other gravitational structures that I plan to analyze with postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, such as particles of light spirally together while emitting gravitational waves, new solutions of Einstein's equations, quantum uncertainty associated with classical chaos for planetary orbits in the Solar System, and space travel methods for escaping the Solar System without the pollution of rocket ejecta.

"Trichomes are epidermal hairs that function to protect plants against herbivores, pathogens and abiotic damage. Glandular trichomes are specialized for the biosynthesis and secretion of natural products. In addition to their importance in plant defense, many of the metabolites produced in glandular trichomes have economic importance as flavours, fragrances and pharmaceutical drugs. Glandular trichomes typically consist of a stalk topped by one or more cells that are specialized for the biosynthesis of natural products. The metabolic products of these cells are secreted into an extracellular cavity that forms between the cell wall and the cuticle. By virtue of their highly specialized metabolism and ease of isolation, glandular trichomes have offered a useful system for dissecting natural product biosynthesis. However, the process by which metabolites are secreted into the subcuticular cavity is not well understood at the molecular level. I propose to study the secretory process in the glandular trichomes of Nicotiana benthamiana. The trichome exudate of Nicotiana trichomes mainly consists of diterpenes and sugar esters. This research will use genomic and proteomic analysis of isolated trichome cells from N. benthamiana to determine a catalog of genes that are expressed in these specialized cells. Genes that may be involved in metabolite secretion (e.g. transporters) will be silenced (turned off) using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). The goal of this research is to identify the genes and proteins that function in metabolite secretion in trichomes. This information may be useful for developing crop species that are more resistant to pests and diseases and in the metabolic engineering of plants to produce valuable metabolites in their trichomes.

"Five co-applicants on this proposal would like to purchase an attachment for our existing ultramicrotome, which was funded by NSERC in 2003, to allow us to cut very thin slices of previously frozen tissue while maintaining the frozen state. This technique and the specialized equipment that is necessary to perform the technique is extremely useful for identifying specific molecules in cells and tissues using antibodies tagged with a label that can be seen under a transmission electron microscope. As a result, the location of the molecule of interest can be pin-pointed with very high accuracy within cells and subcellular compartments. By preserving the molecular components of cells and tissues by freezing, rather than with chemical fixatives, molecules of interest are less likely to be damaged beyond recognition by antibodies, so sensitivity of the labeling technique is greatly improved. Furthermore, the technique does not require the use of detergents to make cell membranes permeable to antibodies, a necessary step of conventional antibody-labeling procedures that drastically diminishes the quality of cellular ultrastructure. The research that will be facilitated by the requested equipment includes: 1) analysis of the effects of maternal stress on the developing nervous system of offspring, 2) study of neural circuits in the mammalian eye, 3) study of the defensive responses of poplar trees as induced by herbivore attacks, and 4) study of the developing nervous system in animals that have a larval stage in the life cycle. In addition, the equipment will be used to explore the use of very thin frozen sections for a mass spectrometry technique, uniquely available at the University of Victoria - Genome BC Proteomics facility in Victoria. This technique allows proteins to be identified and localized with high accuracy within cells and tissues and will be applied to a study of seed development in economically important conifers. A skilled technician employed full time in our Electron Microscopy Laboratory would provide expert training for graduate students in the method of cutting frozen, ultrathin sections.

"Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories have an enduring appeal because of our inherent fascination with bizarre features of animals and plants and our desire to know where they came from. How did flies get their wings? How did birds get their feathers? Interest in novel features of organisms is not only the stuff of quaint entertainments. Questions that ask how an organism acquired a feature that is obviously not present in otherwise similar organisms are of central importance to evolutionary biology. Novelties perplex biologists because, if natural selection works by modifying pre-existing structures, then how do seemingly new characteristics come into being in the first place? The need to explain morphological novelties has been a major impetus for bringing developmental biology back within the embrace of evolutionary biology. Biologists now recognize that small changes during the development of an organism, such as when a structure starts to form, can become magnified into large differences in the fully formed organism. I use gastropod mollusks as a model to study the development of novelties within this hugely diverse group of animals. I am investigating a hypothesis that may explain the highly contorted body plan of gastropods. Comparative studies of gastropod development suggest that the contorsion may have originated as an asymmetry in the development of the two sides of the body. I also seek to explain how predatory gastropods were able to evolve extraordinarily specialized feeding structures without compromising feeding activities of the larval stage. This issue has wide significance because most of the major groups of animals are invertebrates and their bodies are built within a life cycle that includes a larval stage. Needs of the larva may limit possibilities for adult evolution. Finally, I ask how swimming larvae of gastropods acquired the ability to feed and grow prior to metamorphosis. To study these questions, my students and I culture a wide variety of marine gastropods and we use various techniques for morphological analysis, such as scanning and transmission electron microscopy, computer-assisted 3D reconstruction of sectioned material, and immunolabeling to highlight structures and cells of interest.

The development of devices with novel interior/annular flow-paths in/over the cylindrical geometry, via analysis and experiment, such that flow-induced flutter occurs at controllably low flow-rates, designed to operate close to the flutter threshold [high Q, low-damping MEMS/nano devices].

   2. Stability criteria for cylindrical shells containing fluid flow, accounting for nonlinear effects and imperfections [design guidelines for shells conveying fluid, aircraft engines, nuclear reactors]. Wave propagation in fluid-filled/conveying shells with axial segments of alternating variable properties, via analytical modelling and experiments [filtering noise in hydraulic systems].

   3. The nonlinear dynamics of transversally confined cylindrical struts in axial flow, via analytical/ CFD modelling and experiments, more specifically the instability threshold and post-critical dynamics, when the confinement is due to a cylindrical duct or neighbouring cylinders [heat exchangers, nuclear reactor internals].

"Modern understanding of chemistry has come from measurements that average over the properties of many different molecules at the same time. While this approach has been critical to the advancement of science, it is limited because the measurement process itself blurs many interesting and important effects out. Recently, researchers have demonstrated the ability to measure individual molecules through extremely sensitive microscopy, allowing matter to be studied one molecule at a time.  These measurements are of profound importance because they allow scientists to study matter at the most fundamental level possible.

  The purpose of this grant is to provide continued support for the Paige group research program in the field of ultrasensitive (single-molecule) spectroscopy and microscopy.  The overall goal of the research program is to develop and use extremely sensitive measurements to study chemically important systems at the level of individual molecules.  It is anticipated that the work done in this program will lead to extremely useful and versatile new ways of measuring matter, and will ultimately have applications in developing new types of technologically useful materials, and understanding complex biological processes.

   While the number of researchers in this new field is growing rapidly, Canadian involvement has been limited. In order to remain at the forefront of research, Canada needs to develop a strong single-molecule program, and the projects described here will be an important step in doing so.

"Cigar Lake Mine is a prospective uranium property in northern Saskatchewan currently under phased remediation to restore underground workings after major water inflows in 2006 and 2008. The ore is planned to be mined within an area of hydrothermal alteration at the unconformity between sheared and altered graphite metapelite basement rock and overlying Athabasca Sandstone. The objective of this research is to determine how freezing affects the rock mass behaviour with direct application to the Cigar Lake Mining Method. Geotechnical challenges during mining the Cigar Lake orebody include control of groundwater and ground support of weak rock. Artificial ground freezing supports the weak rock associated with the orebody and the minimization of the potential for a large water inrush while mining the ore. The impervious nature of ice and

significant strength increase of soil/weak rock water mixtures are the main benefits of artificial ground freezing. Limited information exists on the behaviour of frozen weak rock as the majority of frozen ground research is based on permafrost regions in surficial soil.



The research will 

-Provide a better understanding of how weak frozen material under pressure behaves in order to design the ice cap thickness and cavity stability

-Establish ground freezing rates to predict material type and correlate frozen geomechanical properties as different material types and water contents will affect freezing rate

-Use predicted frozen material properties to establish cavity size","Advancement of knowledge","University of British Columbia",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","M�canique des roches","G�nie minier et min�ral"

"The oceans, covering 70% of the Earth surface, are estimated to absorb nearly half of the human carbon dioxide emissions produced since 1800 playing therefore a key role in regulating global climate. The fate of carbon dioxide in the ocean is largely determined by biological processes in the water column. The mesopelagic layer, depth between 100 and 1000 m, is providing a vital planetary service by converting > 90% of organic matter exported from the sea surface back into carbon dioxide, vital nutrients, and microelements returning it to the surface over the decades thus fuelling surface primary productivity. Despite its importance, the mesopelagic realm is one of the least studied regions of the ocean and little is known about the processes that control the decomposition of organic matter or its regional variation. The importance of improving our understanding of the processes in the mesopelagic zone is becoming increasingly pressing with the proliferation of proposals for ocean fertilization programs as means reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.

The proposed study of the mesopelagic realms of the world ocean, and the North Pacific in particular, will concentrate at obtaining a novel knowledge on the structure of mesopelagic food-webs with the specific aims: first, to describe composition and diversity of mesopelagic plankton and micronekton communities; second, to quantify complex trophic pathways (who eats whom) within these communities; third, to establish relationships between the amount of influx of surface organic matter into mesopelagic layer and the complexity of mesopelagic food webs; and lastly, to provide a scientific basis for building an ecosystem model that will provide insights into a relationship between communities in the ocean surface, the mesopelagic zone and below ocean, and on how the mesopelagic zone food web controls the efficiency of the biological pump. The proposed research will also be essential in predicting how the role of the mesopelagic zone will change in response to future increases in carbon dioxide levels and associated climatic and oceanographic variability.

"""High Frequency Techniques at UHF and Above"" broadly refers to techniques that can be used to mathematically describe electromagnetic waves at ultra-high frequencies in terms of rays. The proposed research will develop mathematical models that can be applied to practical problems described below.



The aircraft industry is interested in low-profile ""conformal antennas"" that conform to the curved outer surface of the aircraft. Our recent research on ""leaky waves"" has led us to an understanding of what might happen to a leaky-wave antenna if the flat structure gets curved. We will explore the possibilities of designing curved leaky wave antennas.



As a ray passes through a complicated bulding material such as reinforced concrete, it is difficult to predict its strength. We are developing a model for this situation. The results will be useful for the planning of indoor wireless networks.



With support from the Department of National Defence, Ottawa we developed a computer code that uses high frequency techniques to predict the radar signature of naval vessels, aircraft, and other targets of interest. In the course of that work we have identified some theoretical limitations that need to be addressed. In particular,

the effects of sharp corners and edges on a target are difficult to model, and this will require further basic research.",Aerospace,"Concordia University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Antennes et propagation","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"

"Large scale pattern recognition and data mining techniques have resulted in broad and tangible impacts on applications ranging from improved general purpose internet search and semi-automated internet portal construction to accelerated discovery in bioinformatics.  Many problems in pattern recognition and data mining arise in a setting where it is easy to obtain a small amount of labeled training data relative to the amount of available unlabeled data.   Semi-supervised methods for pattern recognition allow labeled data to be combined with unlabeled data to improve the results of a recognition system.  Information extraction is a type of data mining that seeks to extract structured database records from unstructured data. Once information is extracted it is possible to use the underlying structured representation for a variety of tasks such as enhancing search or subsequent data analysis.  The research proposed here will develop new general purpose semi-supervised information extraction techniques.  There is also a growing interest in addressing problems in pattern recognition and data mining can benefit from a tighter coupling of computer vision and text processing techniques.  Concrete examples include: internet scale image search, object recognition with thousands of potential categories and the extraction of information from both images and text descriptions of biological experiments; however, many other emerging problems have similar properties.  The research in this proposal thus also aims to develop principled and efficient methods for semi-supervised pattern recognition, data mining and information extraction with an emphasis on problems that involve the simultaneous processing of images and text.  While the emphasis of this work will be on general purpose algorithms and techniques, to develop and evaluate techniques we propose to use the concrete scenarios of creating an extremely large scale visual encyclopedia by mining the web and creating algorithms also tailored to the more specialized settings of biological image and text analysis.  Research will result in training highly qualified personnel in the development of techniques appropriate for internet scale and genome scale processing - skills in high demand.","Information systems and technology","�cole Polytechnique de Montr�al",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Vision artificielle",Robotique
"In many industries, and in particular the petroleum industry, the cost associated with pumping of fluids (such as oil) is often high. In order to reduce the pumping costs, the power consumption of pumps needs to be reduced. As the power consumption of pumps is directly related to the skin friction in a pipeline, the reduction of skin friction is highly desirable.



It is now well known that a significant reduction of skin friction in turbulent flows can be achieved by the addition of very small quantities of soluble polymers. While drag reduction by polymer additives has received a lot of coverage in the published literature, little attention has been given to the fact that a significant level of skin friction reduction, as much as 70 to 90 %, can also be achieved through the injection of microbubbles (< 100 �m) into the near wall region of a liquid turbulent layer. The injection of microbubbles in the near wall region has been found to significantly improve the performance of surface and subsurface vehicles (ships and submarines). A shot of microbubbles reduces the drag encountered by ships and submarines moving through water.  



The broad objective of the proposed research work is to study skin friction reduction, and hence reduction of power consumption of pumps, in oil pipelines. Microbubbles and macromolecular additives will be used to induce skin friction reduction in turbulent flow of oil. The synergistic effect of mixed microbubble and macromolecular additives on drag reduction in oil pipelines will be investigated. Upon completion of the proposed work, strategies will be recommended to minimize the cost of pumping crude oils.

"The primary objective of the proposed research is to address the integration of sensory, memory, and motor functions that support individual and group behaviors in producing auditory sequences. Music and speech are among the most complex behaviors that people produce in terms of speed and fluency, challenging theories of memory, motor control, and sensorimotor integration. Additional objectives include: How do individual differences in human memory and motor fluency influence sequential performance? How are sources of sensory information integrated with motor processes during production? How does sensorimotor integration change from solo to group behaviors? Novel research paradigms are proposed that combine behavioral and neural measurements of sequential responses that synchronize sound and movement in music, speech, tapping, and other behaviors. 

   The scientific approach addresses three complementary themes: a) how individual differences in speed, accuracy and serial order are affected by motor fluency and sensory information; b) how auditory feedback is integrated in performance tasks; and c) how memory and sensorimotor processes are coordinated in solo and group behaviors. Behavioral measures, neural (EEG) measures, and motion capture techniques for capturing solo and group performance are collected during systematic manipulations of sensory information, practice, and context effects in solo or group performance. Individual differences in speed and accuracy of production will be fit by tests of parameter-based model predictions. 

   Memory and motor processes in sequencing tasks such as music and speech offer significant benefits to health, education, and quality of life, both in basic research and in translations to practical applications. Music and speech activities engage virtually all cognitive functions; this research offers pedagogical and clinical implications for sensorimotor disorders, as well as commercial significance for audio-engineering products and motion sensing devices.

"We propose a world-class training program in auditory cognitive neuroscience that builds on Canada's leading concentration of eminent researchers. McGill, Universit� de Montr�al, and McMaster, together with the Montreal Neurological  and the Rotman Research Institutes, have attracted a critical mass of over 30 experts in the neural substrates of human auditory cognition and of music in particular, whose work covers the spectrum from perception of speech, music, and complex sound to memory, motor performance, and auditory physiology. We will create a training program that builds on this critical mass of expertise and technological investments across Qu�bec and Ontario, to ensure the future generation of scientific discoverers. 



Our program delivers training in two primary areas: the structure and function of the brain's response to music, speech, and complex sound (how these functions change across the lifespan and break down in disease), and corresponding imaging techniques, including MEG, fMRI, EEG, TMS, motion capture, and optical imaging.  The program's approach is to deliver four integrated instructional components to undergraduates, doctoral students, and postdoctoral scholars: a) internships in laboratories at partner institutions;  and b) practicum involvement with two or more populations, such as infants and toddlers; persons with musical and auditory disorders, tinnitus, or cochlear implants; and aging populations with hearing impairments; c) undergraduate summer experience in ACN; and d) seminars and workshops for all trainees across sites.



This training program is a novel and innovative merging of natural and health sciences, with the expected significance of rapid dissemination of cutting-edge technologies and professional best practices worldwide. Also significant is our network's expertise in special populations outcomes, which will prepare trainees to generate new discoveries in auditory cognitive neuroscience that apply to Canada's many constituencies.

"Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions; they routinely increase reaction rates by a trillion-fold. Practically every living process is controlled by enzymatic activity. Understanding specific enzyme mechanisms will allow us and others to predict the function of other enzymes, modify enzymes to generate new catalysts, and design inhibitors that can serve as medicinal agents. This program emphasizes discovery, focusing mainly on enzymes of unknown, uncertain or poorly understood function. Although we maintain an interest in any biological reaction mechanism, we are particularly interested in enzymes considered antimicrobial targets, and enzymes that manipulate the ubiquitous natural product inositol. Applications flowing from this work could include the development of new antibiotics, developing novel catalysts, and gaining a new understanding of how inositol is metabolized by bacteria, including beneficial ""probiotic"" bacteria found in the human mouth and intestine. We also hope to gain insight into the relationship between enzyme structure, function, and evolution.



Our approach involves diverse techniques including molecular biology, enzyme kinetics, isothermal titration microcalorimetry, molecular modelling, and organic synthesis of substrates and substrate analogs.

"In the history of science and technology, there probably has never been a technology that could excite the world and trigger people's imaginations like ""nanotechnology"". Nanotechnology is an emerging field based on dealing with materials/devices at the nanometer scale, which lies between the scale of atomic and quantum phenomena, and the scale of bulk materials. However, nanomaterials are not simply another step in miniaturization of materials. They are in a different arena entirely, as the properties of the nanomaterial are very different from those of either the bulk material or individual molecules. Thus, nanotechnology is receiving world-wide attention of university professors, industrial managers and governmental leaders, and it is anticipated to bring about a revolution in science and technology in the 21st century.

     Similar to architects who need bricks and cements to build the various patterns of architecture; to assemble nanomaterials for real applications, one needs not only nano ""bricks"", but also nano ""cements"". The objectives of the proposed Discovery research program are to develop novel methods for tailored synthesis of metal-based nano ""bricks"" and polymer-based nano ""cements"" to facilitate real applications of the resultant nanomaterials and to synthesize a variety of polymer-cemented and dendrimer-encapsulated nanomaterials. Particular attention will be given to the development of magnetic, optical and catalytic nanomaterials and the exploration of their applications. Green synthetic routes for the synthesis of the nanomaterials assisted by supercritical fluid techniques will be pursued.

     Via this research, significant success can be expected in invention of novel methods and processes for synthesis of various nanomaterials with important applications. The outputs will potentially promote progress in polymer based nanotechnology and result in the establishment of new industrial processes for nanomaterials in Canada. The research project will also help train a number of high quality graduate students and undergraduate students with innovative research ability.

"The uranium deposits in the Athabasca basin, northern Saskatchewan, produce approximately 30% of the global annual output of this strategic material and are hosted by quartz-rich rocks. A previous NSERC-CRD-sponsored research project utilized cathodoluminescene (CL) imaging to demonstrate that quartz grains along the sandstone-basement unconformity, lithological boundaries and faults at the high-grade Cigar Lake and McArthur River deposits are characterized by the presence of alpha-particle-damaged patches and continuous rims. The occurrence and distribution of these characteristic radiation-damage-induced CL in quartz were shown to be a useful paragenetic tool for exploration of uranium deposits in the Athabasca basin. However, CL imaging was generally unable to detect the characteristic radiation damage in quartz from the Key Lake deposit, which is ""loud and clear"" on electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra. Therefore, EPR, an extremely sensitive technique in detecting dilute paramagnetic defects, is potentially more widely applicable in the Athabasca basin than CL imaging. Accordingly, this application is for support of collaborative research between the University of Saskatchewan and the Denison Mines Corporation to take advantage of the superior sensitivity of the EPR technique to further develop natural radiation damage in quartz as a new tool for exploration of uranium deposits in the Athabasca basin. The proposed project includes not only applied research on EPR characterization of natural radiation-induced defects in quartz to define and trace paleo-pathways of uranium-bearing fluids at selected exploration properties in the Athabasca basin but also developmental work on the calibration of radiation damage in quartz for calculating radiation doses of uranium-bearing fluids and fundamental research on the discovery of new radiation-induced defects in quartz. In particular, the proposed research is expected to advance our state-of-the-art knowledge on radiation damage in quartz. Also, this project provides excellent training opportunities for one postdoctoral fellow, one PhD student and three undergraduate students at the University of Saskatchewan.

"Trace defects, including radiation-induced varieties representing incipient radiation damage, exert important influence on all types of physical-chemical properties of minerals (e.g., color, electrical conductivity, magnetism and reactivity) and have a broad range of applications in Earth sciences from geochemical modeling to dosimetry, geochronology, immobilization of heavy metals, nuclear waste disposal, and mineral exploration. Quantitative understanding and applications of trace defects in minerals require accurate information about their speciation and local structural environments. Accordingly, this research program is directed towards the study of structures and applications of trace defects in minerals and related materials. Scientific approach includes field-based investigations to identify trace defects in minerals of important geological applications and/or of direct environmental relevance. Laboratory experiments on the synthesis of these minerals under controlled conditions are designed to complement field-based investigations and to provide synthetic materials for spectroscopic studies. Trace defects in minerals and synthetic analogs are characterized quantitatively by use of multiple spectroscopic techniques, particularly electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. First-principles calculations on the electronic structures of defects in minerals are used to aid quantitative interpretation of results from spectroscopic studies. Specific research objectives for the next five years are: 1) crystal-chemical controls on the uptake of REE and U in apatites and other accessory minerals, 2) discovery and characterization of radiation-induced defects in apatites, fluorite and feldspars by use of multi-frequency EPR spectroscopy, 3) first-principles modeling of selected defects in apatites and fluorite, and 4) applications to field-based geochemical and environmental studies and to exploration of mineral deposits. This research program on the discovery and quantitative study of new defects in minerals and related materials is unique in the Canadian Earth science community and is innovative, as evidenced by its multidisciplinary approach and by the continuing development of new experimental techniques.

An essential goal of the area is to advance in the understanding of randomness. Immediate goals are better understanding of particular algorithms, and the development of new efficient algorithms based on this knowledge. The scientific approach is based on mathematical proofs involving generating functions for counting the properties of interest for the analysis of the algorithms, and asymptotic analysis when exact counting is not possible. My goal in this area is two-folded: to develop algorithms for fundamental problems like sorting and searching with better performance than previously known algorithms, and to contribute to the mathematical understanding of random polynomials over finite fields. 



My second line of research involves computations in finite fields and their applications. Algorithms that work with finite fields play a fundamental role in practical applications in cryptography, coding theory and information theory. My goal in this area is the design of efficient algorithms in finite fields, and the usage of elements from the theory of finite fields in Engineering and Computer Science applications.

"Mammalian systems have evolved two powerful programs to abort the multiplication of cells that carry injury to either the main genetic material (DNA), or other important cellular components: replicative senescence and apoptosis. Replicative senescence is a state in which cells are incapable of further division, and apoptosis represents cellular suicide with the systematic part-by-part degradation and removal of the cell without causing injury to the neighbouring cells. The important issues concerning these phenomena are the stimuli that are capable of triggering these programs, as well as the precise biochemical alterations within the cell that mediate them.

Over the past six years, my lab has been studying the mechanism by which reactive oxygen species (ROS) trigger these phenomena in cells. We have discovered that young dividing human fibroblasts undergo apoptosis under external oxidative stress whereas young quiescent fibroblasts induce premature senescence under oxidative stress. Currently we are trying to find out the mechanism of these two pathways triggered by oxidative stress. An interesting recent development was the discovery that mutations in a gene termed presenilin-1 (PS1) lead to an early-onset of the Alzheimer disease. Our initial experiments with fibroblasts from subjects carrying the mutated form of presenilin-1 showed that these differed from their normal counterparts in that they had higher levels of reactive oxidative species. Since viable brain cells from either normal or Alzheimer patients are not available to perform the delicate biochemical analyses, we believe that these fibroblasts provide an excellent experimental surrogate to address a fundamental question regarding the role of reactive oxygen species in the disease onset.

This proposal is a continuation of our experimental program in which we wish to examine the precise biochemical steps involved in reactive oxygen species mediated induction of either cellular senescence or apoptosis in human fibroblasts using normal cells as well as cells from subjects with mutated presenilin-1.

"Sustainable concrete structures, and elements which are durable, economical, and use industrial by-products are being designed with service lives longer than ever before.  As this trend continues, understanding the performance of cementitious materials and their degradation mechanisms is increasingly becoming an important part of the design process and is the focus of this research proposal that accounts for the influence of environmental conditions, structural requirements, and material durability performance.  Transport properties of concrete exposed to ions reflect the physical pore structure and the interaction between the  ions and the binder. The interaction between chlorides and the binder affect the transport of ions and moisture and also affect the physical pore structure.  Specific descriptions of transport properties which reflect changes to the microstructure upon exposure to ions is warranted to more completely understand the mechanism(s) of degradation and also to predict degradation of concrete over time. 



Two long term objectives of this research program are: (1) Evaluating the influence of chemical hydration and chemical binding reactions on durability performance in order to utilize these findings to develop new analytical concrete durability models, and (2) Providing Canada with a competitive edge in the field of concrete technology through the training of highly qualified personnel, conducting leading-edge research, and dissemination of advancements in material sciences.  This proposal describes the research program and coresponding expenditures which involves 8 students (3 graduate students, and 5 undergraduate).  Advancements in this research area will; enhance public confidence in structures, reduce waste due to the prolonged life of structures, reduce waste through the use of recycled materials, and result in fewer structural failures and unplanned shutdowns of structural systems which serve society.

"Process-based simulation models are essential support tools in water resources management, allowing us to explore and predict the dynamics of state variables and the interactions between subsystems over a wide range of space and time scales. The proposed research will address numerous challenges connected with the modeling of hydrological processes, with a particular focus on the intermediate scale represented by hillslopes and small catchment or aquifer basins. The main themes and objectives revolve around the following research questions: how to match model complexity to data availability, computational resources, and analysis goals; how to assess the validity of underlying assumptions and new hypotheses in evolving models; how to best combine information from measurements and simulations to reduce uncertainty and improve predictions; how to integrate hydrological models to other simulators and tools in multidisciplinary applications; and how to resolve the exchange, or coupling, between processes across the various interfaces in the atmosphere/land- surface/soil/aquifer/stream continuum. The simulation models to be used in the proposed research, developed over the years by the applicant and colleagues at three other universities, include a 3D Richards equation subsurface solver coupled to a path-based surface routing module, a 3D variable density flow and transport code, and a Boussinesq equation model for groundwater flow in sloping aquifers of arbitrary geometry. These are research models that have attracted much interest and have led to an international and expanding network of collaborators (including many students and young researchers) who are using these tools in a wide variety of applications. The funding being requested in this proposal will support a research team consisting of 1 PhD student, 1 postdoctoral researcher (half salary), and 1 intern/summer student. In addition to allowing continued basic research and development along the themes described, this is considered a minimal configuration needed to sustain and manage the collaborations, training opportunities, and applications arising from the applicant's research program and activities.

"The objective of this proposal is to investigate new methods for the asymmetric construction of carbon-carbon bonds. New organocatalysts and chiral scaffolds will be developed and their applications in asymmetric synthesis will be examined. 

Asymmetric Organocatalysis: One aim of this proposal is the development of new organocatalysts for fundamental processes such as stereoselective conjugate additions of carbon nucleophiles to enones and nitroalkenes as well as carbocyclization reactions of aminodienes with acrylates or nitroalkenes. The catalyst types that will be examined are: a) chiral guanidines, b) chiral diamines and triamines. The catalysts will be elaborated from enantiomerically pure amino acids, amino alcohols and terpenoids. 

A study of the nature and positioning of hydrogen bond donor groups in chiral pyrrolidine-based organocatalysts will be undertaken. The utility of these catalysts in conjugate addition and carbocyclization reactions will be studied. Application to the synthesis of bioactive molecules such as the lycorane class of alkaloids will be examined.

2. Asymmetric Synthesis on Chiral Templates: The synthesis and asymmetric functionalization reactions of chiral morpholine templates will be examined. The focus is the development of templates that offer good stereocontrol and easy recovery of the chiral regulator. The use of these templates in stereoselective alkylation, carbonyl addition and aziridination reactions will be studied. The construction of highly functionalized carbocycles, oxacycles and azacycles as well as peptide isosteres will be explored. 

The research will provide new methods for the enantioselective synthesis of molecules that are useful in organic chemistry and medicinal chemistry, and provide training to employ students in the pharmaceutical industry or in academia.

"With increasing global demand for raw materials, the Canadian metals industry is expanding and investing in new projects around the world.  Pressure Hydrometallurgy is a technology used for metal recovery from ores and concentrates that employs high temperatures and pressures on aqueous media.  It has become a very attractive option in the metals industry as it offers several advantages over atmospheric processes.  The present research programme constitutes an on-going effort that focuses on theoretical advances and experimental applications of high-temperature (100-300oC) concentrated electrolyte systems directly related to pressure hydrometallurgical processes. Because chemical reactions in these processes occur very fast, often under very corrosive environments, and in the presence of solid mineral particles, there is a great need to develop robust sensors that can measure key process variables on line and effect process monitoring and control.  The present research programme, aims at developing novel instrumentation and new chemical sensors that will work on-line and at process conditions.  We have already proven the principle of a conductivity-based sensor capable of monitoring free acid concentration in corrosive slurries. We have also adapted a ceramic membrane electrode that was originally built for the nuclear power industry to the needs of the Hydrometallurgical industry. Coupled with our concurrent chemical modelling and simulation studies on high temperature aqueous systems, we convert these sensors from laboratory successes into industrial tools.  To do so, we will develop the use of electrodeless conductivity sensors in high temperature slurry systems. We will also overcome the fragility of the ceramic membrane electrode by implementing metal/metal oxide electrodes.  We will test and develop new sensors to measure REDOX potential. The project will train graduate and undergraduate/summer students in sophisticated electrochemical techniques applied under difficult experimental conditions.  This work contributes to the Canadian economy by generating technology that renders metal producers more competitive in the global markets to satisfy the demand for primary metals in the years ahead.

"    )	In both skeletal and cardiac muscles, contraction is initiated when an action potential propagates through the T-system - an extension of the surface membrane into the interior of the muscle cell.  Depolarization of the T-system then activates dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) proteins that span the T-tubular membrane which then somehow activate Ca2+ release channels in the closely apposed sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane.  In skeletal muscle, it is fairly well established that the primary coupling mechanism involves a physical link between a DHPR and its associated SR Ca2+ release channel.  In cardiac muscle, the traditional view has been that the primary coupling mechanism involves Ca-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), a mechanism involving Ca2+ flux through the DHPR (in its capacity as an L-type Ca2+ channel) followed by binding of Ca to the SR Ca2+ release channel and its subsequent activation.  One experimental aim is to evaluate a controversial proposal that the primary coupling mechanism in cardiac muscle is, in fact, a voltage activation mechanism like that seen in skeletal muscle.  Other aims are to evaluate various Ca feedback mechanisms already shown to be very important in controlling SR Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle.  These include positive and negative feedback mechanisms acting via Ca binding to sites on the SR Ca2+ release channels, Ca inactivation of Ca2+ release and CICR, respectively.  In the case of CICR, the mechanism differs from that described above in that the source of Ca is from the SR instead of from the external solution.  Investigation will also be carried out on possible Ca-feedback mechanisms acting on the intramembranous charge movement signal - a signal reflecting the voltage-sensing step performed by the DHPRs.","Medical and health sciences","Universit� de Sherbrooke",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Mouvements cellulaires","Biologie cellulaire"

"Abrasive jet micromachining (AJM) uses a small high-speed air jet to accelerate microscopic abrasive particles toward a target material. By patterning the target surface with erosion resistant masks, various microscale features (e.g. microchannels, microholes, v grooves, etc) can be mechanically etched into it. The etching can be controlled by varying process parameters such as the mask and particle material properties, the jet impact angle, and the velocity and spatial distribution of particles within the jet. AJM is a relatively new approach to the fabrication of silicon, ceramic and polymeric structures for micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS), optoelectronic, micro-fuel cell and microfluidic applications. Advantages of AJM over traditional microfabrication processes include a much higher material removal rate, a much lower equipment cost, environmental friendliness (no chemicals) and the ability to etch materials to different depths on a single substrate. As a result, simple low cost and environmentally friendly systems can be installed to provide a method for in house rapid prototyping of novel micro scale components. The investigators have previously established process models that can be used to predict the etched shape of commonly used microscale features (channels, holes, planar areas) in glass substrates. The proposed research builds on this work, to establish and experimentally verify analytical and numerical process models that will extend the application of AJM to the micromachining of novel 3D and multilevel features in the materials (polymers/elastomers and layered materials) that will form the next generation of micro components of interest to our industrial partners. These process models will incorporate the effect of changes in a wide variety of process parameters (particle size, shape, velocity, mask material, geometry, target material, etc.) on the predicted etched shape. This fundamental research will form the basis for improving AJM's potential as a low cost and rapid-turnaround technology platform for the microfabrication of novel multilevel and 3D components for the micro fuel cell, microfluidic lab-on-chip, opto-electronics, and MEMS industries in Canada.","Manufacturing processes and products","Ryerson University",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","G�nie m�canique","G�nie m�canique"
"Jets of small abrasive particles propelled by compressed gases have been used for many years to modify engineering surfaces.  One of the most interesting and important applications of abrasive jet technology is as a low cost and rapid micromachining technology for the fabrication of components used in microfluidics, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and opto electronics applications.  Besides its low cost, the technology is attractive because it does not involve the use of harmful chemicals, and it allows for one pass fabrication of micro-features at different depths, something that is difficult with traditional wet etching techniques. The proposed research focuses on the investigation of two poorly understood aspects of abrasive jet micromachining (AJM): (i) The role that particle material, size and shape and target curvature have on machining precision and (ii) the development of models and techniques to use abrasive jets to machine three dimensional (3D) features. 

 

For the AJM of surfaces patterned with erosion resistant masks, smaller particles can arrive closer to the mask edge than larger ones. Also, as machined features such as micro-channels become deeper and narrower, only the smaller particles will strike the bottom.  As a result, the particle size and shape distributions strongly affect the distribution of erosive potential. Modelling of these effects will allow for an optimization of the AJM of high aspect ratio microchannels and microholes.   



Due to its ability to directionally etch, AJM can be used to machine complex 3D  features, using an inclined abrasive jet passed through a patterned erosion resistant mask. The development of a generally applicable model of this oblique blasting process will allow predictive abrasive jet micromachining of complex features that can be used in the next generation of microfluidic chips and MEMS devices.

"Polymer-based composites are becoming viable choices for advanced aerospace, automotive and civil structures.  The proposed research focuses on polymer-matrix woven fiber materials, which are light-weight replacements for metals in aerospace structures.  The durability properties of these material are not as well understood as those of the metals they are intended to replace.  The proposed research will develop models and computational methods for predicting failure of polymer-matrix composites.  These computational methods will encompass recent advances in the field of computational failure mechanics like pinwheel tiling.  Pinwheel tiling is a surprising geometric construction in which a fixed family of grids can represent crack paths going in any arbitrary direction.



The new models and methods will enable an engineer to determine the kind of impact a spacecraft can endure, and how often and by what technique the spacecraft should be inspected for fatigue wear.  The methods can be applied more broadly to many polymer-based composites, e.g., glass-polymer composites used in windshields and other settings where shatterproof windows are desirable.  



The proposed research also encompasses training of undergraduate and graduate students in failure modeling and prediction and advanced computational techniques.  The research and the students trained by it will contribute to Canada's aerospace industry and will enable the design of safer and longer-lasting air and space vehicles.

"The brain contains a network of neurons which communicate by secreting the neurochemical acetylcholine. There is considerable interest in the function of this network since it is abnormal in disorders of both brain development (e.g. Down and Rett syndrome) and aging (Alzheimer's disease). Our research concerns the effects of severely damaging this system, using a neurotoxin which we have shown to be highly selective and potent, on the maturation and aging of the rat brain and behavior. The toxin is administered to the brain shortly after birth and we have shown that this results in lifelong loss of the acetylcholine network. We have discovered that this reduces the number of connections between brain cells and as well, the rate of birth of new brain cells. It also impairs the intelligence of the animal. We propose to examine how this selective brain damage alters the effects of environmental enrichment, antidepressant drugs and stress, on the birth of new brain cells. We will also examine how this brain damage affects the aging of the brain. Specifically, we will study its effects on the complexity of brain cells throughout the life span, including old age, and relate this to the behavior of the animals.

"The GIPSY project aims at the practical investigation on the intensional programming language paradigm as implemented by the Lucid family of programming languages. Lucid variants range from the famous real-time programming language Lustre, to the C-Lucid hybrid programming system GLU. The Lucid family of programming languages being very eclectic and in constant evolution, the GIPSY project aims at providing a common platform for the compilation, execution and development of Lucid variants. With flexibility and generality in mind, our ongoing research program has allowed us to establish a framework approach to compiler and run-time system construction for the execution of programs written in all variants of Lucid. This approach provides a flexible infrastructure for the semi-automated generation of many components of the GIPSY. Using syntactic and semantic language description and translation rules, components like parsers and semantic analyzers and translators can be automatically generated for all Lucid variants. The compiled programs can be further analyzed to allow optimization of their distributed run-time behavior by implementing various solutions for task scheduling using our semantically sound demand-driven execution model. 



We have recently designed a promising multi-tier approach to our run-time system, yielding more flexible and scalable solution to the execution of Lucid programs. We are also in the process of designing and implementing a novel object-oriented version of Lucid that shall make the language more in-line with current industrial trends. Additionally, independent research on intensional programming at the University of New-Brunswick and the University of New South Wales have proven to be compatible with our approach. Part of our future goals is to incorporate results from these teams into our theory and implementation. That shall lead to a unification of current research in the area, and establish the GIPSY as the norm in intensional programming research and development.

"Minerals are naturally-occurring crystalline solids whose morphology and composition are sensitive to environmental conditions under which they form. They may form abiotically, under a wide range of temperature and pressures, or at the Earth's surface where they commonly precipitate under the influence of living organisms. Commonly, their crystals develop morphologies influenced by their environment or by the biochemistry of the living organisms that secrete them. Cristals also commonly capture foreign ions (""impurities""). For these reasons, themorphology and composition of crystalline materials records information about the environmental conditions in which they grew.  Understanding how crystals grow and trap chemical impurities can help us better reconstruct ancient environments and events in Earth's history. It may even help us find ways to design new crystalline materials, repair bones or prevent the formation of undesirable minerals in our bodies.","Earth sciences","McGill University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Min�rologie, chimie des cristaux et cristallographie","Sciences de la terre"

     The presence of a fluorine atom often modifies the activity of a bioactive molecule by changing its solubility, lipophilicity, metabolic stability, conformation, hydrogen bonding ability, or chemical reactivity. In fact, as many as 30-40% of agrochemicals and 20% of pharmaceuticals on the market are estimated to contain fluorine, including half of the top 10 drugs sold in 2005. As a result, the demand for more practical, selective, and efficient methodologies for the synthesis of fluorinated molecules is increasing.



     This research proposal describes novel approaches for the efficient preparation of unique fluorinated compounds. In Part I, the development of the chemistry of 1-fluoro-1-alkynes - in particular, the preparation of fluorinated heterocycles and trisubstituted alkenes - is described. In Part II, the use of an asymmetric allylic alkylation reaction for the preparation of tertiary alpha-fluoroketones and its application to the synthesis of bioactive molecules is shown.



     The development of novel methodologies for the preparation of fluorinated compounds is a challenging and important goal in the context of pharmaceutical lead discovery and lead optimization studies. This methodology will certainly have an impact in medicinal chemistry since it allows preparation of complex fluorinated molecules starting from simple substrates.

"Microfabrication technology, started as an investigation into creating miniature electronic circuits in early 1950's has now created a new paradigm in interdisciplinary research and development. This is quite evident from the numerous electronic gadgets that pervade human society, ranging from portable personal music systems to implantable health aids such as pacemakers and defibrillators. Despite tremendous growth in integrated electronics, the realm of analysis, particularly in the area of clinical sciences, still belongs to bulky instruments and centralized laboratories. MEMS technology and its offshoots, such as microfluidics, are shrinking the laboratory onto a single chip, popularly termed Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) technology. Currently, LOC primarily uses glass substrates, which makes the technologies expensive and not readily compatible with electronic integration. With the increased availability of photo-patternable polymers, a new area of MEMS has emerged, namely the polymer-MEMS technology. Polymer-MEMS technology offers a unique blend of new materials as well as the potential to combine MEMS sensors, actuators, optical components, microfluidic primitives and thin-film electronic components. Polymers also offer excellent biocompatibility, making polymers an ideal choice for miniature clinical diagnostic systems.

In the short term, the research objectives will focus on the continuing development of well characterized polymer-MEMS processes, with a focus on enhancing transducer functionality. Efforts will be focused on the electronic and optical detection of bio-molecules in compact modules, and the integration of these devices with microfluidic systems. In the long term, this interdisciplinary research will lead to the development of a class of miniature hand-held diagnostics/analysis units that can be used by non-technical personnel at home or at walk-in clinics. One area in particular will be the development of hand-held processing units for genotyping, enabling effective targeted medicine.","Instrumentation technology","Simon Fraser University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Micro�lectronique","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"

"Quantum field theory is the ubiquitous language that describes the interplay in physical systems between quantum mechanical behaviour and infinitely many (or very many) degrees of freedom.

It is incumbent upon us to understand the full ramifications of quantum field theory and its description of nature.  Quite important is the semi-classical limit, where the corresponding classical field theory gives an important approximation to the full quantum field theory.  In this limit, soliton solutions become very important.  Applications range from quantum gravitational physics, high energy particle physics to low energy condensed matter physics.  Deformations include quantum dynamical systems which have infinitely many degrees of freedom such as noncommutative geometry and quantum spin chains.  These systems resemble quantum field theories in certain limits.  It is a compelling problem to understand how these theories behave and to which physical systems they can be applied, which is the fundamental inquiry of this research proposal.","Advancement of knowledge","Universit� de Montr�al",2,"SAPIN ","Subatomic Physics Envelope - Individual","Physique et chimie th�oriques","Physique et chimie th�oriques"
"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been drawing a great deal of attention within both the public and private sectors as an effective tool for mitigation, prevention, and timely response to emergency situations. However, for non-military applications, UAVs have not been as easily adopted as the potential of these systems suggests. This is in part due to issues of regulation and licensing but it is also due in significant part to the difficulties in actually operating UAVs in a safe and effective manner without significant investment in human resources in terms of training and especially for the actual flying. In order for UAVs to become part of the mainstream set of tools used to improve Canadian safety and security; advances are necessary in the control and automatic operation of these systems.

In existing UAV systems, a human operator intervenes in the UAV's operation or maneuvers in a somewhat disjointed manner. The human operator normally assists in the UAV in take-off, landing and in some cases to fly the UAV to established or dynamically selected waypoints. Although this type of human-computer integrated control has proven to be an effective way to operate long-range and medium/high-altitude UAVs, a greater level of flexibility in the human-computer interaction is required for operation of low-altitude UAVs. The environment in which low-altitude UAVs' function is much more dynamic requiring a more flexible autonomy with seamless transfer of control in the presence of static/dynamic clutter and variable obstacles in

which the UAV is being positioned. The need for rapid, timely and accurate response by the UAV is more critical.

Funding is therefore sought to support a UAV research program for urban policing, law enforcement and effective monitoring for deliberate criminal/terrorist acts with a focus on low-altitude UAV in order to develop a flexible human-computer control mechanism to make these UAVs a viable surveillance and monitoring alternative",Aerospace,"University of Regina",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Asservissements,"G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"

"Based on previous achievements, the research proposed in this application will be focused on the development of existent or new models and methods, with enhanced capabilities, for the simulation of icing & anti-icing phenomena and vertical axis wind turbine performance prediction and optimization.

Being a major hazard in-flight icing is included in the aircraft design, certification and operating regulations. For designers and certification authorities the numerical simulation of airframe icing is becoming a more affordable alternative to wind tunnel experiments or flight tests. Current two and three dimensional icing codes are very useful, but their accuracy needs further improvement. Ice growth physics must be realistically modeled, with accreted shape/flow field iteration. In this domain the proposed research will address problems of numerical simulation of water impingement, icing related roughness, splashing and shedding of supercooled large droplets as well as hot-air anti-icing. 

Recent experimental and numerical studies prove the growing interest in assessing and using the wind potential of urban environments, where wind accelerates near buildings and significantly gains in speed around the higher ones. This ""concentrator effect"" can be used to convert, close to the consumer, the wind's enhanced energy. In such environ-ments small size (up to 100 kW) Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT) have certain advantages over the Horizontal Axis type, hence their use is favored. The wind energy related research proposed here regards the prediction and optimization of the VAWT performances in urban conditions. The Darrieus-type VAWT rotors, are also suitable for tidal currents power generation, due to the fact that their rotation is independent from the direction of the flow, which greatly simplifies the necessary equipment.

The results of the proposed research (models, methods and numerical tools) will help the Canadian aerospace industry to build airplanes able to fly safely in all-weather conditions and to increase the renewable energy part in Canada's energy resources.

"Energy is critical to our standard of living and our economy, nevertheless, the goal is not only to produce energy but to produce ""clean"" energy.   The proposed objective of Prof. Paraschivoiu's research is to develop simulations tools that are used to improve the acceptance of new clean energy sources.  To be more specific, computational simulations of flow will be used to promote safety and trust in high pressure hydrogen storage and acoustic simulations will be developed to study the noise pollution from wind turbines. 

    The Hydrogen energy is increasingly attractive for the automotive industry but storing hydrogen and issues related to its safety remain. In the short term, high pressure reservoirs seem to be the first solution for hydrogen storage. For public acceptance, safety is the main concern and requires establishing codes and standards that minimize risk, in particular the risk of explosion if there is hydrogen release from the reservoir. To this end many scenarios need to be simulated and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is the preferred tool to do this investigation. CFD is a numerical technique to simulate flows on complex geometries. Obviously, the solution accuracy is critical and is not available with the existing commercial packages for this problem. Prof. Paraschivoiu is developing new CFD tools for this application.  This proposal aims at studying the hydrogen jet as it exits the reservoir at sonic speeds as well as the hydrogen cloud that is formed.

    Wind turbines produce a relative low level of noise but public opposition to this irritation is growing. To decrease the noise pollution, noise production as well as noise propagation must be studied. A significant research effort is dedicated to the noise production but very little work addresses the noise propagation. Prof. Paraschivoiu has experience on acoustic simulations and is proposing to develop a simulation tool to calculate the acoustic propagation of noise generated by wind turbines. This vibro-acoustic simulation code will include some of the state of the art technique for spatial approximations and solver acceleration that can also be used in the more general area of scientific computing.

"Teleoperation and automation of mobile underground mining equipment has a potential to enable ore extraction in difficult and hazardous conditions, extend operation time, limit equipment abuse, drive maintenance cost down, reduce man-labour and, eventually, cut production cost. The fact that only a limited amount of research has been done to investigate different aspects of equipment effectiveness may be one of the reasons behind some failed automation attempts. In this context, the main long term objective of this research is to develop models enabling precise quantitative and qualitative assessment of the factors affecting functionality and usability of teleoperated equipment and processes. These are related mainly to reliability, maintainability, availability, utilization, productivity and effectiveness. The approach is based on a holistic view of teleoperated equipment and process operation under the unique conditions of underground mining environment seen from a broader perspective than in previous research. The above mentioned factors will be identified, classified and their criticality will be investigated. The studies will be done first at the individual piece of equipment (for example LHD) level and then at the process (loading, haulage, drilling) level. Subsequently, it will become possible to develop a simulation model (or models), test and validate it. This will enable a detailed analysis, sensitivity studies and assessment of teleoperated equipment/system functionality and usability in a given operational environment. The model(s) and guidelines to be developed will assist mine operators, equipment manufacturers and other parties in their decision making and finding optimal solutions through better anticipation, prevention and/or mitigation of potential risks to the teleoperation projects. This will increase a competitiveness of Canadian metal mines. The proposed work will also pave the way for next ones aimed at the investigation of functionality and usability at higher levels of the control hierarchy, i.e. whole mine operations based on the teleoperated /telerobotized equipment and, ultimately, at the enterprise level. These projects will also include an investigation of cost effectiveness aspects.

"The number of objects that humans can hold simultaneously in memory for a short time (our working memory) is remarkably small. The maximum is thought to be seven, as in the number of digits in a phone number, but the average is about only four! The limited capacity of our working memory depends on neural mechanisms that are distributed in the frontal and parietal lobes of our brain, but the current state of our knowledge is far from complete. On the one hand, only basic memory mechanisms have been studied because there exists no adequate animal model to study working memory capacity. On the other hand, nearly all our knowledge about these basic memory mechanisms has been obtained from studies of the frontal cortex despite all the evidence indicating that the parietal cortex also plays an important role. In this proposal, we will first establish a new animal model to study working memory capacity by adapting a simple procedure that has been extensively used in humans for that purpose. Next, we will study the mostly unexplored neural mechanisms within the parietal cortex by recording the activity of neurons while animals perform this new working memory task. Finally, computer simulations of models built from all the available data will help us formalize our findings and make detailed predictions that can be tested with future experiments. The results of this multi-disciplinary research will have implications for the basic study of information processing taking place within and between neurons within the cerebral cortex, which can be applied to other brain functions, i.e., the limits of our perception and attention. In addition, it will allow students with diverse background - such as biology, psychology, engineering, computer and cognitive science - to gain high quality training in several experimental methods. This research experience will prepare them to enter various areas of research as emerging young leaders, thereby helping to satisfy the increasing demand for highly qualified individuals in academia and industries.

"Much of modern pure mathematics deals with abstract structures. This is useful as it allows one to see how different theories are similar while emphasizing their differences. There are many different such abstract structures and the study of how they inter-relate is the domain of category theory. Within category theory itself, there is a variety of meta structures, and it is the study of their properties that is the object of our research, namely double category theory. Thus we can imagine the whole structure of mathematics as a tree with double categories at the root, categories the next level up, then abstract structures with the final level being applications. Thus our research is foundational in nature.","Not available","Dalhousie University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Math�matiques pures","Math�matiques pures"

"Present models using compositional data constrained to a simplex such as plant and soil analyses disregard the fact that components must interact within a closed information space. Since any change in one constituent must be accompanied by a change in other constituents by resonance in a closed system, system patterns of organization may be spoiled by spurious correlations. Compositional analysis takes into account all possible interactions among components within a simplex. Compositional data analysis has been successfully applied in many scientific fields and, more recently, for nutrient diagnosis of many crop species and interpreting phosphorus transformations in soils. As a measure of deviation from targeted composition, the Mahalanobis distance was found to detect nutritionally imbalanced corn plants as 'outliers'.  On the other hand, the phosphorus fractionation procedures for soils, crop residues, and organic products allow distinguishing between labile and non labile P pools. The P in labile and non labile pools in response to a driving variable (time, crop rotation, soil conservation practice, added P) can be modelled by compositional analysis using formalisms such as the perturbation vector, the simplicial metric, and the Mahalanobis distance. Soil P buffering capacity that protects the soil against soluble P loss and controls the P supply to roots is an important soil function that can be related to either the simplicial metric or the Mahalanobis distance. The Mehlich-III P saturation ratio proved to be a reliable indicator of soil P buffering capacity. The relationships between Mehlich-III indexes and labile and non labile pools of P could support the present environmental thresholds for both mineral and organic soils. Our main objective is to develop compositional models for crop nutrients and soil P in soil-plant systems. In this project, we will apply the compositional-Mahalanobis concept to ten crops in Quebec and Brazil. In addition, we will fractionate the P in soils, organic inputs, and crop residues and analyze P fractions using compositional analysis as well as indexes of soil P buffering capacity. On the long run, we will classify soils and plants according to their compositional patterns in response to driving variables.

"The Kraft process produces wood pulp for the manufacture of high quality printing papers, tissue papers and packaging material. It is an attractive candidate for partial conversion to biorefinery while maintaining the manufacturing of its traditional core products. The premise of the forest biorefinery is that some of the organic constituents of the wood which are by-products of the chemical pulping step dissolved in the spent liquor may be used for greater advantage than being burnt on-site to recover their beating value as is currently done; they could be used as feedstock for the manufacture of a broad variety of products which have a significant market value. However, the conversion of a Kraft mill to a biorefinery will profoundly modify its capacity for sustainable energy production. This project proposes to develop a methodology and criteria to evaluate the techno-economic feasibility of biorefinery options for Canadian Kraft mills. Starting from the base-case of highly integrated and energy efficient Kraft mills, we will apply state-of-the-art simulation techniques and systems engineering tools to examine the effects of key biorefinery technologies on the energy balance and operating cost of the process. They are, lignin precipitation, hemicelluloses extraction and biomass gasification. A new methodology for advanced energy efficiency analysis will be developed and applied to the study. It will take into account the factors that affect energy consumption individually and in conjunction: internal energy recovery, use of steam injection and mixing, water systems closure, heat and power production and the incorporation of energy upgrading technologies (co- and tri-generation, absorption heat pumps). Economic viability will be assessed by a new thermo-economic analysis method. The impacts of biorefining technologies on the process air emissions will be determined. The major outcome of this project will be guidelines that can be applied to examine the feasibility of proposed biorefinery concepts, guide investments in these technologies and help develop research strategies that address technical impediments. Models of biorefinery unit operations and a unique process simulation software for pulp mill-based biorefineries will be produced and validated.

"A nascent science of reforestation with native trees is emerging in response to the challenge of reclaiming abandoned and degraded lands in the tropics. The biology of most tropical trees remains poorly known, however, which constrains their deployment in reforestation and afforestation projects. To address this knowledge deficit, I will develop systematic silvicultural analyses for native and exotic tree species that are being grown in the PRORENA project, Republic of Panama. Species' silvics will be be described relative to (a) their survival, growth and morphology under a range of environmental conditions, and (b) their effects on local ecosystem processes. Based on these parameters, groupings of species with distinctive growth, survival, and ecological characteristics will be developed to provide the basis for long term plantation trials. These trials will consist of species mixtures and monocultures that have been selected for their potential to fulfill regionally specific restoration goals. These goals include (1) achieving control of the invasive grass Sacharum spontaneum, (2) restoring fertility and soil structure to severely eroded land, and (3) modulation of hydrological regimes and runoff in the Panama Canal Watershed.

     My project will be the first systematic attempt to categorize neotropical trees according to their ecological effects on restoration sites. The synthesis of species responses to a range of environmental conditions, their effects on soils and local hydrology, and the use of restoration functional groups to design plantations for specific purposes represent unique contributions to tropical forestry.  My project will contribute to developing Canadian research and educational links with Central America, and to the development of Canadian research capacity in tropical forestry. End users of the knowledge generated by this project include academic researchers, Panamanian government agencies (e.g. the Panama Canal Authority), small farmers, and restoration practitioners. Advanced training opportunities for Canadian and Panamanian students are an inherent part of my program.

"#In today's competitive automotive industry, every automaker is investing significant amount of its resource to accomplish two objectives: (1) reduce manufacturing costs; and (2) minimize the weight of vehicles to improve fuel efficiency. These efforts affect every single part of vehicle and the porous duct, which is an integral component of the air-intake system, is a prime example that would benefit from those efforts significantly. MAHLE Filter Systems Canada is one of the chief manufacturers of porous ducts, and their current porous duct is manufactured with fiber-woven materials. However, it is very costly to produce because of its high material cost and the complex manufacturing process to fabricate it. MAHLE Filter Systems Canada is, therefore, eager to substitute the existing fiber-woven porous ducts with plastic porous ones without compromising their required properties. With the implementation of economical injection molding process, the manufacturing cost would be reduced substantially. In addition, the material cost would be decreased significantly by utilizing inexpensive polymers and fillers. Thus, the proposed alternative has extremely high potential for a positive economic impact on the company. Since the company does not have any significant experience with the processes such as injection foam molding and creating a porous structure using leaching, the Microcellular Plastics Manufacturing Laboratory (MPML) at the University of Toronto is exceptionally capable to meet the company's needs because it has profound knowledge and experience on the processes. The long-term objective of this joint research program is to produce porous plastic duct as an alternative to the current expensive fiber-woven porous ducts. In order to accomplish this ultimate goal, we are proposing an approach that consists of four short-term goals: (i) the identification of the ideal base resin; (ii) the exploration of the structure-property relationship of plastic open-celled foams using various materials and processing parameters; (iii) the determination of the optimal open-cell morphology for the required properties; and (iv) the extensive investigation of the processing-structure relationship of plastic open-celled foams.","Manufacturing processes and products","University of Toronto",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Science et technologie des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"
"With regard to fuel consumption, a diesel engine is more efficient than its gasoline counterpart. With an increased use of diesel engines, regulations on diesel emissions are becoming tougher. These emissions, however, can be restricted by employing after-treatment devices such as diesel particulate filters (DPFs). Currently, three types of filters are available for the reduction of particulate emissions of diesel passenger cars and trucks: (1) segmented SiC filters; (2) cordierite filters; and (3) metal-based filters. In this context, the present proposal aims at developing a new class of materials based on nickel-alloy foams for use in DPFs. The following salient features are envisioned: (i) a uniform pore size of approximately 200 micrometers (�100 �m) and a bimodal pore size in the range of 20-1000 micrometers; (ii) a porosity in the range of 80-95% without significant sacrifice of the mechanical properties; and (iii) a uniform coating of a metal alloy over the porous Ni structure. The above-mentioned material will be produced with a novel processing technique. A cellular structure will be created by foaming a polymer, such as methyl cellulose, with Ni/Alloy powders using surfactant in order to achieve a high void fraction. This is followed by sintering, during which the polymer is flashed off to create void fractions with the nickel, thereby forming a skeleton over which the alloy powder is condensed as a uniform layer. The overall approach consists in marrying the foam processing technology available at the Microcellular Plastics Manufacturing Laboratory at the University of Toronto with the powder sintering technology available at Vale Inco Ltd. Three steps will be involved: 1. The development of foamable cellulose/nickel powder/alloy powder mixtures; 2. The foaming process of the above mixture; 3. The removal of cellulose and the formation of Ni-alloy foams by sintering. Both the product evolution and the processing technology development in each step, i.e., in the preparation of wet foams, green cakes, and sintered foams, will be considered.

"Plastics are the most commonly utilized materials in the world. In recent years, extensive research on advancec polymer composites has allowed automotive industry to produce low cost, strong, but lightweight automotive parts. However, the price of crude oil, which is the main source of most plastics, continues to increase substantially in recent years. In response to this, plastic product manufacturers have made extensive efforts to reduce the material costs, which typically account for about 70% of the production cost. It is believed that plastic foaming provides a vital solution to the continuous rise in plastic resins cost because less material is needed. Furthermore, by customizing the cellular morphology, the plastic foams will offer improvements in a wide range of properties. During the last two decades, the plastic foam industry has experienced serious regulatory, environmental, and economical pressures. High ozone-depleting-potential (ODP) chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbon-based (HCFC-based) blowing agents have been banned and will be phased out in North America as of January 2010, respectively. Hence, foam industry is in urgent needs to search for new alternative zero-ODP blowing agents such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), hydrocarbons (HCs), water, ethanol, carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N2). However, their relatively low solubility and high diffusivity in various polymers have made the foaming process challenging. In response to this, researchers and industry have been exploring the uses of blowing agent blends. Nevertheless, very limited fundamental research on the foaming mechanism using blowing agent mixtures has been conducted. The end results of this research is expected to provide guidance to choose the optimal composition of environmental-friendly blowing agent blends and offer insights to develop sustainable foaming technology.","Manufacturing processes and products","University of Toronto",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Science et technologie des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"

"Topology is a branch of geometry where two geometric objects are considered to be equal if they can be continuously deformed from one to the other.  Four-manifolds are four-dimensional geometric objects that do not have any sharp corner or an edge.  They are of fundamental importance as our universe itself can be modeled using them.  Most elementary examples of four-manifolds are the complex surfaces, which are defined by systems of equations in complex numbers.  It is now known that the vast majority of four-manifolds are not complex surfaces.  My proposed research will study a more general class of four-manifolds, called symplectic four-manifolds.  Although most four-manifolds are not symplectic either, experts conjecture that all four-manifolds can be built up from symplectic four-manifolds via some cut-and-paste operations.  The complete classification of symplectic four-manifolds is still far out of our reach with our current knowledge, but topologists have been making significant progress in recent years.    



Classical knot theory deals with classifying knotted one-dimensional curves in three-dimensional space.  My proposed research will study knotted two-dimensional surfaces in symplectic four-manifolds.  Note that dimensions of both the knotted object and the ambient space containing it have gone up by one, and consequently the classification of such knotted two-dimensional surfaces turns out to be a rather daunting task.  My research will focus on the subclass of two-dimensional surfaces that inherit a symplectic substructure from the ambient symplectic four-manifold containing them.  Experts conjecture that the number and the variety of knotted two-dimensional surfaces within this subclass measure the topological complexity of the ambient symplectic four-manifold containing those knotted surfaces.  My previous research has shown some evidence of this conjecture and I hope that my future work in this direction can contribute towards the classification of symplectic four-manifolds.

"The main goal of this proposed project is the pre-competitive development of a portable and wearable ambulatory monitoring and assistive system using distributed wireless MARG (Magnetic, Angular Rate, Gravity) sensors. Many patients can benefit from continuous monitoring as a diagnostic procedure, early detection or optimal maintenance of a chronic condition, or during rehabilitation from a surgical procedure or an acute event such as stroke. The proposed system will consist of a network of custom-developed miniature and untethered MARG sensors, called Wireless Inertial Sensor Packages (WISPs), which will be specifically designed for the task of capturing the ambulatory movements of human body segments in a distributed fashion. The distributed WISPs can be attached to a set of interconnecting body segments (e.g. upper limb, lower limb, or entire body) of a patient, and cooperatively provide the real-time measurements of their kinematics. The potential impact of such a truly ambulatory motion tracking system is enormous, opening the possibility of continuous monitoring of patients on-field, over extended periods of time.

This project is a collaborative research partnership between the University of Victoria and 6th Dimension Devices Inc. (6DD), which is a start-up sport science technology company located in Victoria, BC. Due to this partnership, the probability of success of the proposed research is significantly enhanced.

"The active control of flexible structures has been an active field of research for several decades, and has played an important role. This stems from the increased use of lightweight and lightly damped materials in flexible structures such as manipulators, rotor blades and aerospace structures. These structures have several advantages, such as high payload/weight ratio for power efficiency and fast maneuvering, in comparison to their rigid counterparts. However, flexible structures have the disadvantage of more pronounced vibrations due to higher flexibility. A viable solution to this problem is the use of distributed arrays of sensors and actuators, coupled with active control strategies, in order to enhance the stiffness and damping properties of the structure. 



The proposed research program addresses the active control of flexible structures using an array of sensors and actuators and distributed control techniques. This control problem represents a natural evolution of research in active control technology of flexible structures. Distributing a large array of sensors and actuators in a spatial configuration gives unprecedented capabilities for control. However, the large number of sensors and actuators also implies a large number of inputs and outputs in the control system, and introduces severe technical challenges as many of the standard control techniques are not able to handle systems of very high dimensions. Therefore, the proposed research program is aimed at finding solutions to applications in flexible structures that face such challenges, taking advantage of recent advances in distributed control techniques.

"Kinesins are molecular motors that share a common structural core with myosins and G proteins and play diverse roles in organelle transport, cell division, and cell movement. Kinesin motors use the chemical energy derived from the hydrolysis of adenosine tri-phosphate to generate force for a unidirectional movement along the microtubule highway and transport cargoes (vesicles, protein complexes, RNAs and mitochondria). Regulation of kinesin motors is important because a constantly active motor would consume futile adenosine tri-phosphate and move to the tips of microtubules without loaded cargoes. Both Kinesin-1 and KIF13B cycle between two conformations: the folded, inhibited state and the extended, activated state.  The proposed studies will give a first look at the structures of the cargo binding domains and provide a basis for explaining how kinesin is regulated by the cargo binding domains.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","University of Toronto",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Cytosquelette,"Biologie cellulaire"

"Transport Canada's ""Road Safety Vision 2010"" aims to reduce the number of casualties for the 2008-2010 period by 30% compared to the 1996-2001 period. The plan includes a 40% decrease in the number of casualties on rural highways where the speed limit is 80-90km/hr, and a 20% decrease in the number of casualties involving commercial vehicles. A high level safety plan, however, does not automatically accomplish the goal or targets. The support of lower level programs or projects provided by the local agencies that construct and manage rural highways is also needed. Unfortunately, local agencies often lack the manpower, expertise, and/or funding to address safety issues over the vast length of the rural highway network. Agencies have difficulty identifying specific highway locations where safety improvement should be introduced, and difficulty developing strategies that focus on system-wide improvements.



The study outlined in this proposal will develop a theoretically rigorous and practical tool that can be used by highway professionals to evaluate and assess the safety performance of existing and/or future highway facilities. The tool is innovative because it uses individual vehicles' estimated speed differentials to evaluate safety performance. Speed differentials on highways are a central issue in safety because they result from individual drivers' perceptions of highway design features, environmental factors, and weather conditions. The products of the proposed research will contribute to Canada's economic growth by providing competitive mobility and by improving the safety of travellers and goods on Canada's highway network.

"This research concerns contamination of groundwater in shallow aquifers caused by releases into the ground of organic industrial chemicals. The research is focused on contaminated groundwater in permeable sand deposits that are common across Canada and beyond and concerns the most common category of persistent organic contaminant: chlorinated solvents used in numerous types of industrial manufacturing and cleaning operations. These chemicals were heavier-than-water, oil-like liquids when they were released into the ground decades ago. They sank through the sand to end up as immobile pools resting on top of clay layers within or at the bottom of the sand aquifers. This oil-like liquid slowly dissolves and diffuses into the adjacent, nearly impervious clayey layers. At many of these contaminated industrial sites, great effort is being directed at removing these contaminants from the sand, however after this aquifer restoration is accomplished, the contaminant mass previously diffused into the clayey layers gradually diffuses back out into the sand to cause persistent groundwater contamination. This research involves field studies at such contaminated sites and use of computer models to help understand and predict how long the contamination will persist into the future, which in some cases is expected to be hundreds of years.",Environment,"University of Guelph",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Hydrologie,Hydrologie

"We know that galaxies live in extended dark matter halos, but the size and shape of these halos are poorly constrained. Dark matter does not emit light which makes studying its properties particularly difficult. However, the amount and distribution of dark matter can be inferred by its gravitational influence using gravitational lensing. Linking observed galaxies to the halos in which they live can help us to constrain different aspects of galaxy formation, for example the efficiency of star formation.



This proposal focusses on measuring the gravitational lensing, hence dark matter properties, at two different mass scales. The first study concerns determining the dark matter properties of galaxy-sized objects, and correlating the dark matter properties with the observed, luminous properties of the galaxies. The second study is related to galaxy groups. Galaxy groups are small collections of galaxies which are gravitationally bound. Most galaxies in the local universe live in galaxy groups, but their properties are relatively poorly understood compared to galaxy clusters and individual galaxies, because they are difficult to identify on the sky. I propose to study these systems using ground- and space-based optical imaging, combined with complementary data at different wavelengths in order to better understand the relationship between the dark and luminous components of galaxies and galaxy groups.

"Our program of research is aimed at understanding the nature of associations that develop between tastes and/or contextual cues and drugs.  We evaluate the role of nausea, fear and drug reward in motivating responding to stimuli following pairing with rewarding or aversive drugs.  Our work has shed some light on the paradoxical finding that in rats a rewarding drug produces avoidance of a taste with which it is paired, but a preference for a context with which it is paired.  Although rewarding drugs and drugs that produce nausea both produce taste avoidance in rats, only nauseating drugs produce a conditioned disgust reaction during re-exposure to the taste.  This suggests that different mechanisms are involved in taste avoidance produced by emetic drugs and rewarding drugs. Our work is aimed at better understanding this dissociation by evaluating manipulations of the serotonin system (which may produce nausea) and the endocannabinoid system (which may relieve nausea) on conditioned disgust reactions in rats (which do not vomit in response to toxins) and vomiting in shrews.  Since the neurobiology of nausea is not well understood, conditioned disgust reactions elicited by a nausea-paired flavor or a nausea-paired context may serve as an effective rodent model to investigate this phenomenon. This work has also led to investigations of evolutionary mechanisms that may guide food selection in rats and shrews; for instance, unlike rats, shrews actually develop a preference for a taste paired with a rewarding drug. Finally, we are also interested in associations that occur between contextual cues and drugs, using a conditioned floor preference paradigm.  Our work is aimed at understanding the early phases of opiate dependence, relapse following extinction training and the role of the endocannabinoid system in the extinction of such learning.   Our program cuts across the traditional boundaries of psychology, pharmacology and neurobiology, contributing not only to understanding basic processes of learning, but also how those processes impact on food selection, opiate addiction and gastrointestinal malaise.

"The free radical theory of aging suggests that aging results from an accumulation of damage to cellular components, resulting in cell death, tissue and organ failure, and eventually the death of the organism.  The source of this damage is believed to be reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced as toxic byproducts of normal metabolism. ROS are implicated in a variety of age-related disorders including diabetes, cancer, atherosclerosis, and neurodegenerative disease. ROS are highly reactive molecules capable of damaging cellular components including DNA, proteins, and membranes. As well as directly damaging cells, ROS play critical physiological roles by modulating many of the cell signaling pathways which control gene expression. Unfortunately, most of our insights into the biological roles of ROS have been derived from studies in cell culture systems, and their significance to functioning tissue in an intact whole organism remains uncertain.



ROS metabolizing enzymes, such as Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and catalase (CAT), are the first line of defense against elevated levels of ROS. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, genetic strains exist which lack these enzymes, and consequently show reduced longevity and develop a set of physiological disorders reminiscent of human age-related diseases. My research program uses strains lacking SOD1 to investigate the damaging effects of ROS in specific tissues of a complete organism. We are investigating the hypothesis that the inability of SOD1 mutants to properly eliminate ROS may result in disruption of cell signaling, and that the resulting changes in gene expression may be the ultimate cause of the pathologies observed in SOD1 mutants. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms by which ROS cause cell and tissue dysfunction will provide insight into the causes of age-related disease in all organisms, including humans. Such diseases represent a huge burden on the health, welfare, and economic prospects of Canadians. Considering the demographic profile of the Canadian population, basic research that promises to diminish this burden is essential.

"Water is our most precious resource. This research program will advance knowledge on measuring and modeling water flow and contaminant transport through field soils under different agricultural management practices and climatic regimes. The research results will be of significant interest to farm commodity groups, government agricultural research scientists and engineers, and others managing and studying soil water and groundwater resources in rural areas. The results could be used to predict least-impact timing of nutrient and manure applications, irrigation timing and amount, design of drainage systems to minimize groundwater contamination, etc. The main objectives of the research program are to develop new methods of measuring and modeling temporal variability of soil hydrologic properties under different agricultural management practices and climatic regimes, calibrate and validate new models using the field data, and develop a database of long-term soil water balances for different regions of Canada. A combination of instrument development, fieldwork and computer modeling will be used to fulfill the objectives. The first step is to develop novel methods of automatically and continuously measuring soil hydrologic properties in the field using multipurpose soil water sensors. The field data will be used to calibrate and test a new model that estimates the soil water balance using crop, climatic and soil hydrologic property data as main inputs. The new model will include factors critical to many Canadian agricultural regions such as the effects of freezing and thawing, tile drainage, and temporal variability of soil hydrologic properties on the estimated soil water balance. Even in today's most sophisticated water balance simulation models, allowing for the effects of changes in soil hydrologic properties during the growing and non-growing seasons is currently unavailable. Temporal variability in soil hydrologic properties may be even more important than spatial, but it has received relatively little attention. As a long-term goal, the database of model estimated evapotranspiration, deep drainage, and runoff for different cropping systems and regions in Canada will be made available to the public on the Internet.

"The blood-brain barrier is composed of specialized cells lining the blood vessels of the brain.  This barrier provides the brain with a controlled environment optimal for brain function.  The endothelial cells that comprise the barrier are tightly apposed in a manner that restricts diffusion of ions, small molecules and proteins across this cell layer.  While the endothelial cells comprise the barrier, other cell types provide growth factors and signaling molecules that affect the function of the barrier.  These other cell types include astrocytes and neurons.  A new term, ""the neurovascular unit"", has been coined, to reflect the interconnections among these cells.      

    The objectives of this proposal are to

1.    )	Develop cell culture models of the blood-brain barrier that consist of endothelial cells alone or in combination with astrocytes or astrocytes and neurons.  

2.    )	Compare these blood-brain barrier models for permeability in control and stimulated conditions.  Permeability will be assessed by measuring the rate of transfer of different sized tracers (e.g. radiolabeled sucrose, MW 342, and fluorescent albumin, MW 66,000) across the endothelial cell monolayer.  Agents that stimulate endothelial cells, astrocytes or neurons (e.g. cAMP, nitric oxide, potassium, sodium channel blockers) and their effects on permeability will be evaluated.  

3.    )	The signaling pathways involved in regulating blood-brain barrier permeability will be explored through assays of gene expression and protein function.   

    The blood-brain barrier is a dynamic structure with regulated expression of receptors and transporters.  Regulation of barrier function is difficult to study in vivo and current cell culture models lack a critical cell type, neurons.  This project will examine the signals sent and the resulting responses among endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons in response to agents that activate cell signaling pathways.

"Cellular metabolism represents a collection of enzymatic reactions and transport processes that convert metabolites into the molecules required for life. Typically enzymes operate as a collective system within the context of functional pathways. Recent studies have revealed that these pathways exhibit a high degree of spatial organization either through the formation of sub-cellular compartments or protein complexes. Such organization provides a mechanism to 'channel' a substrate from one enzyme to another, increasing product yield and reaction efficiency. Through spatially coordinating enzymes within pathways, there is an opportunity to translate the potential benefits of channeling to many applications currently being targeted by metabolic engineering. In a novel and multi-disciplinary approach combining bioinformatics with computer simulations, we propose to systematically identify the conditions required for channeling to operate and improve pathway performance. By predicting reactions which are most likely to benefit from channeling, this knowledge will be exploited to design synthetic pathways more effectively. 



Recently it has been shown that protein based bacterial nanocompartments can be synthesized and used to encapsulate enzymes. We will develop this methodology further both for use as a powerful means for validating instances of channeling identified above, and as a future application for the construction of efficient nanoreactors. The successful outcome of these studies will have considerable ramifications for the design and engineering of novel metabolic systems with the potential to benefit many areas of biotechnology including the synthesis of drugs, production of biofuels and the degradation of environmental pollutants.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","University of Toronto",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Biochimie,Biochimie

"If a customer places an order with a company, and if the order must go through several stages of operation before completion, how long does the customer have to wait? What should the company's promised delivery time be given that several other, similar, orders may also have to be processed? How should the company calculate the probability of fulfilling the customer's order within a specific time interval? Can the company reduce the fulfilment probability by speeding up operations and/or hiring additional workers? If other companies are also competing for the same customer's business, what is a good ""time to fulfilment"" strategy for all companies?

    To answer these questions, I plan to consider supply chains with multiple stages where each stage is completed in a random length of time. An order that is placed in stage one is considered fulfilled when all the stages are completed. I define the responsiveness of a supply chain as the probability that an order placed now will be fulfilled within t time units. I will first examine the responsiveness of supply chains where queueing effects are present within the supply chain, i.e., several orders may be competing for the company's production capacity and each order has to traverse one stage of the chain that is a queue. When the queueing effects are not present, i.e., when the order must traverse stages that are exogenous to the system, then the problem becomes relatively simpler since we can then measure the responsiveness of the chain by manipulating sums of random variables (or, their functions). I also plan to examine an extension of the models presented in this proposal by assuming multiple supply chains competing with each other.

"This study is a continuation of our ongoing program of research to investigate the importance of lipids in marine organisms and the cycling of these carbon-rich compounds in cold ocean ecosystems. 

Objective 1: to compare lipid production, transport and fate in very different fjords at the same latitude: Bonne Bay, Newfoundland and Saanich Inlet, Vancouver Island. In studying these two seasonally highly productive areas we will test hypotheses concerning polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthesis and membrane fluidity in relation to temperature, and PUFA oxidation in relation to oxygen concentrations. These studies are timely given continuing fishery problems, interest in new fishery species, and increasing aquaculture on both coasts. 

Objective 2: to set up feeding experiments focussing on biomarker and nutritional lipids including omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs. In tandem with our first objective, we will investigate short food chains leading to scallops, echinoderms and cod. Such a unique and ambitious study is possible at the Ocean Sciences Centre where we have each of the components in culture and where we have the instrumentation to perform these analyses. These experiments are important for using biomarkers to identify food web sources, pathways and sinks and for determining the extent of conservation and modification of critical essential fatty acids. 

Objective 3: to investigate the effects of high levels of PUFA on oxidative status and membrane fluidity in animals from our field and lab studies. We will look at oxidation products of PUFA and we will determine fluidity of cell membranes. In the marine literature the oxidative instability of PUFA and their importance in maintaining membrane fluidity have often been stated: this will be among the few attempts at actually determining if this is true. The oxidation data will help explain losses in food webs and why some lipids have been shown to be toxic. This is very important for protecting against deleterious effects of lipids in aquaculture and in the study of harmful algal blooms. The combination of the fluidity, food web and oxidation work is critical to the nutritional management of finfish and bivalve broodstock and larvae in Canadian aquaculture.

"This NSERC discovery research program is based on the study of ecological complexity.  We investigate the nature and origins of complex structures and dynamics in ecological systems through the application of theories and methods from the study of complex systems and the development of novel quantitative approaches in ecological informatics. By studying ecosystems as complex systems, the long-term goal is to advance scientific understanding of the structure and dynamics of natural systems so that we can more effectively manage human-environmental interactions. The current focus of our research activities is the modelling and characterisation of ecological complexity in terrestrial systems. Our short-term objectives address two key challenges in the field: 1) characterising complex structures and dynamics in ecological systems over multiple spatial and temporal scales, and, 2) understanding the mechanisms responsible for the appearance of these structures and dynamics (i.e., searching for relationships between pattern and process) through modelling. Over the next 5 years, we plan to address these challenges by: 1) developing new measures of spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal complexity that can be applied to ecological data, and 2) developing and using individual-based and other ""bottom-up"" models of ecosystems to explore the relationships between processes at different scales (e.g., gene, individual, community, landscape). Through this research program, we aim to develop better ecological indicators and more appropriate methods of ecosystem management, restoration and protection.

"The problem of semantics is one of the pressing issues both in effectively representing the semantics of a domain in information systems artifacts (data and software), and in supporting large-scale sharing of information across multiple independent sources, such as those available over the Internet. The Addressing the problem of semantics effectively requires overcoming two challenges: (1) specifying semantics for a single information source; and (2) providing mechanisms for reconciling the semantic specifications provided by independent sources.  



The proposed research will develop new approaches to providing semantic specifications to information sources and to reconciling independent sources, and will evaluate the effectiveness of these approaches. We will build on earlier work by focusing on three areas. First, we will develop methods to enhance the semantics of information models by exploiting the inference capabilities afforded through the classification of instances. Second, we will apply the concept of classification-based inference to provide a semantic layer to tagging mechanisms that have recently emerged as popular tools for annotating content in social networking contexts (e.g., del.icio.us and Flickr.com). Third, we will apply and evaluate the methods developed in the first two phases of research to business contexts. In particular, we will use the classification principles to develop domain ontologies for the online travel industry in conjunction with an industry partner based in Asia.



As the availability and scope of networked resources grow, the need for effective methods and tools to locate and manage information is becoming more critical to both individuals and organizations. This research aims to contribute to information engineering by supporting the effective classification of information resources in order to improve the ability to search, filter, and use these resources.","Information systems and technology","Memorial University of Newfoundland",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Gestion de bases de donn�es","Technologie de l'information"
"This study investigates application of portfolio management approach to control different types of risk in production systems. In case of a company offering various categories of products having a limited lifespan for fulfilling the demand in the short period, such as, for example, food products, electronics, etc., the strategic issue becomes how to manage the production capacity in order to minimize the effects of internal and external uncertainty. Moreover, market forecasting, selection, and considering the risk of new technologies and products are other essential matters. The research aims to develop:

- Taxonomy of various types of risk in manufacturing of perishable or dated products and modeling them,

- Models considering market behavior and effects of disruptive products

- Models considering internal plant risks and limitations

"Automatic Fiber Placement (AFP) is an advanced technology for manufacturing composite structures of complex geometry. Boeing, Airbus and other world leading aircraft manufacturers have recently started to use this process for aviation products because its capability of automated fabrication reduces manual labour, improves product quality and cuts the final cost. Compared to other composite manufacturing processes, AFP gives the freedom of steering fiber-tow orientations along curvilinear paths, controlling the tow speed and spatially placing the required number of fibers throughout a complex structural geometry. This results in enhanced structural performance and reduced weight. Although these improvements are promising, two key factors currently hinder the fulfillment of AFP potential. The first is a manufacturing issue that emerges with the formation of defects with unknown impact on the mechanical properties of the final product. The second is a design matter, which consists of the exploitation of the steering fiber capabilities to optimize the structural performance. This project aims at the characterization of the impact of process-induced defects on the mechanical properties with the final aim of defining optimized steered fiber paths and minimizing undesirable detrimental defects. The work requires the intertwining of complementary expertise from a) composite material characterization, b) failure analysis and prediction models, c) multiscale modelling and structural optimization, as well as d) know-how about the AFP process. Each member of the research team will provide a required competence: a) from �cole Polytechnique de Montr�al; b) and c) from McGill University, d) from NRC-IAR and the industrial partners (Bombardier Aerospace and Composite Atlantic). The expected outcomes of this project are both scientific and economic. The first is knowledge contribution that will allow the industrial partners to be the Canadian leaders in AFP manufacturing, as they plan to be. The second is the impact of the added knowledge on the Canadian economy, especially for the aircraft industry. Several students involved in this collaborative research will develop skills that the industrial partners are looking for.

"For this CCINSERC New Media Initiative project, computer music composer Arne Eigenfeldt

and artificial intelligence researcher Philippe Pasquier will collaborate to explore and define the

boundaries of musical metacreation. A metacreation is software which, using aspects of artificial

intelligence, cognitive modeling, artificial life or machine learning, displays creative behaviors;

that is behaviors which would be considered creative if performed by humans. New musical

metacreation software systems will be developed that extend, refine and apply techniques from

the fields of artificial agents, multi-agent systems and cognitive modeling. It is expected that

these systems will learn compositional and performative creative musical behaviors from both

existing musical corpus and real-time interaction with performing musicians. The resulting

musical metacreations will be presented publicly both nationally and internationally, in

traditional concert settings, public installations, and online web releases. Furthermore, the

metacreations will be objectively validated through artist and audience feedback and response to

determine their musical success. This collaborative scientific and artistic research effort will

advance the state of the art in the fast growing domain of entertainment computing in which

software creativity and creative software are central.","Information and communication services","Simon Fraser University",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Intelligence artificielle (vision artificielle, utiliser 2603)","Intelligence artificielle"
"Automated negotiation provides an important foundation for technical services in the information society (pulled by applications like e-commerce and pushed by technologies like web-services and grid computing). Mechanisms in which software agents exchange potential agreements (offers) according to various rules of interaction have become very popular in recent years. These mechanisms try to accommodate the agents' preferences and include: game-theoretic analysis and heuristic-based approaches. A growing body of research is now emerging that points out limitations in such mechanisms and advocates the hypothesis that agents can increase the likelihood and quality of an agreement by exchanging arguments that influence each others' mental states (and thus preferences). This is the idea of argumentation-based approaches to negotiation. While this idea is not completely new, no work has provided evidence of the advantage of argumentation-based negotiation so far.



The long-term aim of that research is to prepare the next generation of negotiating agents that would subsequently integrate argumentation-based negotiation techniques. In order to do so, we will develop formal and computational models of argumentation-based negotiation of increasing complexity and provide for each of them an analytical (when possible) or empirical evaluation along with a comparison with traditional approaches to automated negotiation.

"Man-made Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) threaten to change our climate on a scale that will cause tremendous human suffering over the next century. GHGs are created through the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gasoline, primarily in electrical power plants and automobiles. This research will develop new chemical systems that capture GHGs such as CO2, as well as other dangerous pollutants (i.e.SO2, NOx) and keep them in an easily managed solid form that can be transported to facilities where controlled and safe release of the pollutant can be carried out for storage/disposal. The research is developing a unique new theory for the prediction of the energetics of these and other chemical reaction systems. This predictive ability will facilitate the design of new chemical systems in which the absorption and release of trapped pollutants happens under very mild conditions, needing very little added energy. This attribute gives these new systems a critical advantage over existing carbon capture technologies, since large amounts of energy are needed for the release of trapped pollutants in these older technologies. This required energy must be generated by methods that themselves produce large amounts of GHGs (i.e. burning fossil fuels to make steam, creating electricity from coal or oil, etc). In fact, it has been shown that a conventional electrical power plant has to sacrifice between 9 and 25% of its energy output in order to capture most (but not all) of the GHGs in its flue gas. The new chemical pollution abatement systems that are developed in this program will allow a drastic reduction in those GHGs co-generated by the heating processes needed for regeneration of the trapping agent, making them a key weapon in the war on GHG emissions over the next century.",Environment,"University of New Brunswick",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Chimie inorganique -- non m�taux","Chimie inorganique"

"Although efforts are being made to prevent heart disease, it continues to be one of the leading causes of death around the world. To address the high cost and high morbidity rates, scientists have been studying ways of reducing the invasiveness of heart surgeries by minimizing incision size and performing surgery on the beating heart. In Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS), the instruments and a camera enter the body through small incisions (called ports). This approach has been shown to reduce patient recovery time, length of hospital stay and morbidity rates.

The difficulties created by the reduced access conditions in MIS have been solved by the development of remotely controlled robotic manipulators like the da Vinci� Surgical System from Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Although the use of this technology continues to progress, improper planning of an MIS procedure can require conversion to open surgery, increasing the probability of cardiovascular events, morbidity and mortality. To address these issues, the proposed research will focus on developing an optimal planning strategy based on patient specific models that reflect intra-operative conditions, and robot workspace optimization for minimally invasive cardiac surgery. The outcome of this research will be a reduction in surgical time and in the number of conversions to open surgery caused by poor access or reduced dexterity.   The proposed research will involve the following steps: develop patient-specific thorax models that reflect intraoperative conditions; develop a graphics-based simulation environment for the surgical robot; develop patient selection measures and algorithms for minimally invasive cardiac surgery; and develop performance measures for minimally invasive surgical robots and their application in locating the ports. These elements will be integrated into one surgical planning system and validated by comparing the predicted and actual outcomes of cardiac procedures. The end result will be a comprehensive optimal planning strategy that will result in more efficient planning of cardiac surgery by determining patient suitability and optimal port locations.

"The upcoming revolution in intelligent, image-guided mechatronic technology for surgery and therapy will lead to major benefits to the healthcare system with potential for significant commercial gain. The proposed CREATE program on Computer-Assisted Medical Interventions (CAMI) is motivated by the fact that the research required to develop the next generation of technologies for medical interventions is highly multidisciplinary, requiring not only a deep understanding of clinical applications, but also significant expertise in a wide range of areas such as mechatronics, engineering design, medical robotics, medical imaging, biomechanics, haptics and human-machine interaction, visualization and virtual-reality based simulations. The key objective of the CAMI program is to develop and implement a unique transdisciplinary research and training environment in which a group of top researchers with diverse expertise will collaborate to train the next generation of researchers in interventional technologies and techniques for surgery and therapy. 

The CAMI program is innovative in that it will result in a unique transdisciplinary ""hands-on"" clinically-motivated research and training environment that will be very different from that currently available at other universities and research organizations in Canada. This environment will therefore enable trainees to acquire skills that are not obtainable elsewhere in the country. The expertise of the investigators and the world-class facilities available for the CAMI program will enable trainees to acquire real-world experience in sensor based state-of-the-art image-guided mechatronic systems for surgery and therapy, medical imaging, and in developing practical solutions to utilize them effectively. The individual disciplines that constitute CAMI are in themselves areas of intense research; however, individually they fall short when training experts in the broad transdisciplinary area of CAMI. We strongly believe that it is only through a research and training program such as the one proposed here that trainees will be able to acquire expertise in all of the key areas needed to enable Canada to be a world leader in technology development for medical interventions.

"This proposal concerns the equilibrium and dynamical theory of liquids and solutions. We consider both bulk homogeneous phases and interfacial systems. The research program emphasizes the development of theoretical methods and their application to systems of physical interest. To achieve this end, we employ a combination of analytical statistical mechanical theories and computer simulation techniques. Principal areas of current research are as follows: (1) Nematic Fluids with Wall and Field Interactions: Ordering of Nematic Colloids. Nematic liquid crystals near solid surfaces are a topic of intense research both for their intrinsic interest, and because of their key role in display devices. Such interactions are also important in a new type of materials, nematic colloids. Our objective is to gain a microscopic understanding of these systems. (2) Protein Denaturation and Osmolyte Intervention. Small organic molecules called osmolytes play a crucial role in protecting biological organisms under osmotic (water) stress. Our focus is on understanding how the osmolyte,  trimethylamine-N-oxide, prevents protein denaturation in stressful conditions. (3) Water Adsorption and Ice Nucleation on Clay. This is relevant to atmospheric science, particularly to cloud formation. The aim is to better understand the water adsorption and ice nucleation properties of particular treated and untreated clay particles. (4) Structure, Phase Transitions, and Interactions in Confined Fluids. It is now recognized that phase-change-related phenomena can induce long-range forces between immersed objects ranging in size from large molecules, to colloidal particles, to surfaces. These forces can influence physically important processes such as coagulation of colloidal suspensions, and possibly the configuration of polymers in solution. We are interested in new but related effects that emerge for chemically patterned plates or particles immersed in binary mixtures, and for water and ions in patterned nanopores. (5) Coulombic Fluids. Our focus is on understanding the important molecular factors that contribute to the structure and dynamics of room temperature ionic liquid.

"The mega trend for the world chemical industry is to substitute petroleum for renewable resources and coal.  Coal is the most abundant source of carbon and many nations, including Canada, use it exclusively for power generation, while others use it to produce liquid fuels and, to a much lesser extent, chemicals (South Africa).  Canada has a tremendous store of biomass and petroleum.  

Economically transforming our biomass, coal and oilsands into highly valued chemicals requires new technology:  Catalysis conducted at high pressure and temperature in a fluidized bed is an approach with tremendous potential. 

The equipment requested in this proposal will allow us to test catalysts and propose innovative technological solutions for emerging processes.  The facility will operate at pressures greater than 70 barg and 650oC, which will be unique for academic institutions.  The reactor vessel will be to resist corrosive atmospheres and will be 0.04 m in diameter and 1 m tall.  As much as 400 g of catalyst will be tested.  We will concentrate on three aspects: (a) kinetic studies at elevated pressure (b) feed gas cycling - oxidation/reduction, hydrocarbon feed followed by coke combustion - and, (c) catalyst stability.

In the next 5 years, we envision collaborating with major petroleum, chemical and catalyst companies and anticipate that as many as 5 graduate - doctoral and master's - and undergraduate students will work with the equipment.  Processes to be studied will include production of substitute natural gas (SNG), methanol-to-gasoline, acrolein from glycerol, and high temperature air separation.

"Canada is facing major challenges in both the manufacturing sector as well as the energy industry.  We are perceived as lagging behind the world in the exploitation of renewable resources as we invest heavily into oils sands development projects.   Partly for these reasons, environmental technologies and natural resources (including energy) have been identified as two of Canada's four Science and Technology priorities.  Sub-priorities are cleaner processing methods, reducing hydrocarbon consumption and biofuels.  Our laboratory is focussed on these strategies and has filed patents on biomass conversion to specialty chemicals, developed efficient combustion techniques for power and energy and is searching for alternative renewable resources to replace conventional hydrocarbons as a feedstock.  The common platform to commercialize these technologies relies on fluidized bed technology and catalysis.  High pressurized fluidized beds could play a key role in to expand our competiveness in chemicals and energy manufacture and to grow a sustainable economy.  An essential element of this strategy is to produce attrition resistant catalyst that can withstand the mechanical stresses characteristic of fluidized beds operating at high pressure.     )	

This research project is divided into three themes. The objective of the first is to produce attrition resistant porous micro-spheres, which involves nano-powder technology, rheology, multi-phase flow, and heat and mass transfer.  Developing mathematical models for gas-solids suspensions in high pressure fluidized bed reactors is the subject of the second theme.   Experimental data from laboratory and commercial fluidized bed will be used to develop design criteria for scale-up. These models will be used to understand and then to minimize the mechanical stresses in the reactor.  Superior catalyst attrition resistance enhances the operability of any commercial plant but catalytic performance determines the economic viability.   The third theme concentrates on transient kinetic analysis under high pressure to establish the relationship between catalyst morphology and reactor performance - conversion, selectivity and catalyst life.

"Robotics is a multidisciplinary research field requiring knowledge from several disciplines including computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. Robotics researchers searched for new application fields and identified the medical interventions as one with many potential applications. Although promising results have been achieved, medical robotics still pose a number of challenges that can be answered only by the joint effort of engineering and medical researchers.

Commercial master-slave medical robots have been developed and they have already a well defined place in the medical field. On the other hand the systems for image guided interventions are still in research stage. A robotic system for image guided interventions is required to automatically perform an intervention using a plan defined by a physician using medical images. Therefore the 'intelligence' required from the robotic system is higher then the one required from a master slave - manipulator which moves under surgeon control.

Our research program focuses on enhancing image guided medical robots with the ability of performing basic procedures on soft tissue. The robots will be able to execute a soft tissue intervention defined using medical images and compensate deformation incurred during the execution. Examples of such basic procedures are image guided needle insertions, soft tissue manipulation, soft tissue cutting. 

This research is expected to have an impact on medical robotics by enabling automatic soft tissue interventions. The control algorithms that we will develop have the potential of enabling long distance telesurgery. In this approach the remote robot will carry out automatically using image and force feedback operating plans sent from the master controller. This may overcome the inherent problems caused by the transmission delay in the case of traditional master-slave control over long distances. Last but not least the control algorithms are expected to be instrumental in other fields that require deformable object manipulations like food industry and deformable object assembly.

"The purpose of this research is to develop a mathematical framework for solving large scale stochastic decision problems and capacity planning within healthcare management.  Such decisions include the scheduling of patients to a specific resource and the daily decisions around hospital congestion and ward capacity.  A shortage of resources in Canadian hospitals is a chronic and steadily worsening challenge.  Thus, the efficient use of what resources are available is becoming increasingly critical.  We seek to develop a model that will concurrently determine the optimal decision policy and the optimal capacity allocation.  We will look to analyse the impact of available surge capacity (i.e. overtime) and determine the appropriate balance between surge and base capacity.  Markov decision processes (MDPs) are an ideal method for solving stochastic decision problems but suffer from two deficiencies.  First, MDPs generally solve the decision problem and the capacity planning problem in sequence rather than in parallel.  This does not take into account the inter-related nature of these two problems.  Second, MDPs are limited in the size of decision problem they can handle.  We seek to apply and improve the methodologies of approximate dynamic programming (ADP) that allow the use of MDP theory for large scale stochastic decision problems.  The overall contributions of this research are both in the practical applications to healthcare management (in improved resource utilization and evidence-based capacity planning) as well as the discovery of fundamental insights into the inter-related nature of decision policies and capacity planning and the improvement of ADP theory in solving large scale stochastic decision problems.

"The proposed research falls within the Strategic Project Grants target area of Healthy Environment and Ecosystems (Ecosystem Adaptation, Interventions and Modeling).  We will provide a detailed assessment of the impact of climate change, as archived in Late Holocene (last ~3500 years) lake sediments, and tree ring records spanning the last 200 years, to provide information valuable for current and future management of the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road (TCWR). The TCWR is the world's longest heavy haul ice road (586 km) extending from Yellowknife, NT into southern NU.  The TCWR is critical to the economy of the NT with more than $500 million per year in goods passing north to service mines along the route. As 87% of the TCWR is built over lakes, any change in ice stability, thickness, and duration of cover associated with climate variability impacts use of the road. For example, the unusually mild and stormy El Ni�o influenced, winter of 2006 shortened winter road operations to 26 days below average, resulting in only 6,841 loads going north. As a consequence there were substantial industry losses (e.g. mothballing of the Tahera Diamond Jericho Diamond Project has been linked to the prohibitive cost of flying in fuel). With a projected growth in truck traffic to 14,000 loads north by 2013 it is critical that policy makers, planners, and mine developers have reasonable data upon which to base economic forecasts, as alternate transportation costs (e.g. air transport) are prohibitively high.  In our multi-disciplinary research on a series of cores collected along the length of the TCWR we will provide high-resolution information on climate variability and its affects on aquatic and terrestrial environments in the central NT. Our methodology will permit us to recognize cycles and trends that have impacted climate change.  Through use of time series analyses we will predict possible future trends in climate and ice cover.  This information may be used by stakeholders (e.g., industry, government, non-government organizations, and First Nations groups) to strategically manage northern ecosystems and to inform policy makers and planners of potential climate conditions that may prevail in the coming decades.

"Known as the El Ni�o of the Atlantic, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the dominant climate mode that affects eastern North America and Western Europe. Characterized by fluctuations in pressure within the Icelandic Low and the Azores High, the NAO is responsible for periods of extreme cold and high precipitation, as well as drought and heat waves.



We have documented that variation in the climate of the North Atlantic has played a dominant role in the lives of humans over the last 2,000 years. The NAO has likely also played a major role in human and environmental affairs throughout the Holocene and has possibly influenced global climate at least back to the Pliocene. By generating a record of subseasonal temperature variability from our cores, we can reconstruct seasonal climate variability as well as the strength and persistence of the NAO over the last 11,500 years. By comparing our NAO record to climate proxy data in other parts of the world, we can evaluate the relationship between global temperatures and the behavior of the NAO. This relationship will in turn permit atmospheric and ocean circulation modelers to more realistically predict future NAO activity under various global warming scenarios. Because eastern North America and Western Europe are among the most heavily populated and economically important regions on Earth, it is critical for a stable global economy that we better understand this flickering climate switch.



I propose to apply recent advances in state-of-the-art robotic micromilling technology toward the first reconstruction of subseasonal North Atlantic Ocean temperature variability over the last 11,500 years using an exceptional suite of North Atlantic sediment cores. This proposed research has the potential to lead to a significant breakthrough in our understanding of climate variation and related forcing mechanisms.

"Mudrocks are relatively understudied and are mostly ignored despite the fact that they comprise over 50 % of all sedimentary rocks in the geologic record.  There has been a renewed interest in mudrocks over the past few years partly in response to the economic potential of shale gas and basin center gas.  The focus of this research will be the Cretaceous Mancos Shale mudstone belt in Utah.  The Cretaceous was a naturally occurring greenhouse period in Earth's history when the dinosaurs reigned supreme and the Western Interior of North America from Arctic Canada to the Gulf of Mexico was flooded with sea water.  Global sea level was up to 250 m higher than present day.  The Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway (CWIS) dissected the North American continent into two parts: a mountainous western half and a lower-lying eastern half.  The western half was tectonically active with only a narrow coastal plain separating the mountains from the sea.  Small- to moderate-sized, fast-flowing rivers drained the eastern part of the mountains and transported a significant volume of sediments into the CWIS, depositing a thick succession of sands, silts and clays.  Following deposition and lithification, these sedimentary rocks were slowly uplifted to form the magnificent scenery in the western interior of the United States.  One of the most spectacular regions is the Canyonlands-area of east-central Utah which is home to one of the longest continuous cliff-lines in the world, the 300-km-long Book Cliffs.  The main objective of this research is to add fundamental new knowledge regarding the origin and internal architecture of offshore mudstone belts.  Long-term goals for this research are to unravel the sediment delivery mechanisms and dominant direction of sediment transport on the shelf, and to develop appropriate models for shelf mudstones.  Unravelling the origin and internal architecture of the Mancos Shale mud belt will lead to a better understanding of shallow marine sedimentation patterns, sea level change (i.e. rate, magnitude, cyclicity), basin history and environmental change through time.  The latter is essential for placing our modern ""early stage"" greenhouse conditions into their proper historical perspective.

"Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a major Ser/Thr phosphatase in eukaryotic cells participating in a wide variety of cell functions including cell cycle regulation, muscle contraction, glycogen metabolism, cell differentiation, neural function and signal transduction. In dividing mammalian cells, PP1 is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent protein kinases Cdk1 and Cdk2. Recently we discovered that phosphorylation of PP1 is significantly suppressed in brain extracts from mice deficient in transcription factor Egr-1. We also found that cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 phosphorylates PP1 during neuronal differentiation. More recently, we observed that 14-3-3, a phosphoserine-binding scaffold protein binds to phosphorylated PP1 in differentiation neurons. In the proposed study, we will use nerve growth factor-induced differentiating PC12 cells, mouse primary neurons deficient in Egr-1, biochemical, genetic and cell biology procedures to determine how Egr-1, Cdk5 and 14-3-3 communicate with each other leading to phosphorylation of PP1 and how PP1 phosphorylation regulates neuronal differentiation. Results of our study will elucidate the molecular mechanism by which neurons differentiate, a physiological process involved in brain development.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","McGill University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Diff�renciation cellulaire","Biologie cellulaire"

"Research will be pursued in a number of related areas in which I have been working in the last several years, such as: generalized linear models, count data, proportions and contingency tables with over/under dispersion,  zero-inflated generalized linear models, correlated familial and survey data, survival models, longitudinal data analysis and finite mixture models. Research will also be pursued on inference procedures for generalized linear models, specifically for binomial and Poisson regression models with over dispersion and /or zero-inflation involving missing data, model misspecification and covariate measurement errors. Multivariate binary and Poisson (specifically bivariate Poisson)  regression models will be studied. Goodness of fit tests and homogeneity testing has been and will be an important area of research. Epidemiological risk measures, such as, risk difference, risk ratio and relative risks for clustered correlated binary data will be studied and new procedures will be developed and compared. Methods for longitudinal Binary and Poisson data will be studied and new procedures involving GEEs will be developed and compared. Random effects, mixed effects models (GLMMs), and homogeneity testing will be studied in this context. Inference on the choice of variance function in semiparametric methodology, such as quasi-likelihood, extended quasi-likelihood, double extended quasi-likelihood will be studied. Inference procedures for the class of skew-normal ( a model providing specific departure from normality) distributions will be studied. Inference for common odds ratio in several 2x2 contingency tables will be studied. Inference procedures, that is, point and interval estimation and hypothesis testing procedures will be developed and evaluated. Tools, such as, maximum likelihood estimation, quasi-likelihood, extended quasi-likelihood, double extended quasi-likelihood, score tests, likelihood ratio tests and bootstrapp tests will be used and evaluated both theoretically and empirically. Rresearch results have and will have direct impact on varieties of fields of application, such as biology, Epidemiology, medical sciences and Engineering.

"In vertebrate cells, the nucleus is a highly organized compartment which is delimited by the nuclear envelope (NE) and where the genetic material is segregated from the cytoplasm. In most cells, the nuclear compartment is very dynamic, displaying remodeling throughout the cell cycle and undergoing rapid disassembly and reassembly during cell division. Some of the determinants implicated in nuclear dynamics are known to reside within the NE. Constituting a functional interface at the periphery of the nucleus, the proteins of the NE interact with each other and/or with chromosomes to provide mechanic stability to the nuclear compartment, contribute to dynamic reorganization of the nuclear interior and modulate gene expression. Interestingly, several human diseases including multiple forms of dystrophy as well as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria and Buschke-Ollendorf syndromes have been recently related to mutations in proteins of the NE. How deficiencies into these proteins can lead to such serious conditions remains enigmatic. My research proposal is aimed towards a better understanding of the molecular interactions occurring at the NE and focuses my activities on the functional analysis of NE constituents such as LAP2 and MAN1 proteins. Three strategies will be exploited: a) the expression and the function of MAN1 proteins during the embryonic development of zebrafish will be investigated; b) the relationship between the DNA coding activity and the distribution/expression of NE proteins will be examined; and c) the protein-protein interactions at the NE will be characterized. Hopefully, the above strategies will provide us with key data on the role of NE proteins in the structural and functional integrity of the nucleus, but also will generate new informations in the etiology of disorders related to deficiencies in these proteins.","Advancement of knowledge","University of Ottawa",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Biologie cellulaire","Biologie cellulaire"

"Although embryogenesis is an organism's central development process, in plants the early events are difficult to study because they occur within the ovule. It is also a challenge to obtain sufficient quantities of early stage embryo tissue to study the process at cellular and molecular levels. In the last 20 years microspore (immature pollen) culture systems have been developed for several plant species which produce large numbers of embryos that are very similar to zygotic embryos in their composition, morphology and function. In addition, in microspore cultures, all stages of the process are readily accessible, the starting material is single-celled and the culture medium is liquid (and easily modified). For most microspore culture systems the developmental trigger is a simple stress treatment. For example, embryo development in Brassica napus microspore cultures is induced by a mild heat treatment. For these reasons microspore cultures are good model systems for studying the early stages of embryogenesis in plants. In addition, microspore cultures are widely used to produce double haploid populations for plant breeding programs.  In the last five years our group has developed flow cytometric assays to identify cells that begin the embryogenic program as soon as 3 days after the heat treatment and we have developed cell sorting procedures to obtain pure populations of embryogenic cells. Our studies have shown that embryogenic cells become basic compared to those that remain in a pollen development pathway and we have identified 100 genes that are upregulated in embryogenic cells. The objective of the proposed work will be to determine how the redirection of development, from pollen maturation to embryogenesis, is initiated and sustained in microspore cultures at cellular and molecular levels. The information gained from the proposed studies will contribute to the basic understanding of the earliest stages of plant embryogenesis and could be applied to increase the responsiveness of genotypes that are currently recalcitrant to microspore culture but are desirable for plant improvement purposes.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","University of Guelph",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Diff�renciation cellulaire","Biologie cellulaire"

"Recent years have seen an increase in demand for broadband services like video, voice and data transmission, while users increasingly demand anytime network connectivity. To satisfy these needs, the communications industry is moving towards dynamic networks for multiple transmission media - cable, wireless and optical fiber. As the backbone of the internet, photonic networks must become dynamic themselves, from the core to the access points, and must be adaptive to changing traffic and link conditions. 



     Our research is focused on how to bring intelligence into photonic networks: how to develop rigorous algorithms that will make networks robust, flexible and self-adapting. We will address the challenge of how to make them robust by uniquely treating optical networks as dynamical systems. We will create new algorithms for automatic network control and self-management, by using system theoretical methods. These algorithms will allow photonic network capacity to be set up, configured and re-adjusted with minimal human intervention. As an alternative to ad-hoc approaches, the system theoretic approach of our research will provide a rigorous basis for photonic network algorithm design.



    Why is this so important? Because a solid theoretical foundation is required upfront if we are to develop scalable tools and techniques for dynamic photonic networks, that move beyond heuristics and ensure network performance and stability.  When successfully deployed, these capabilities will bring benefits to time-critical and high-bandwidth applications, hence benefits to Canadian information technology economy.

"Protein-protein interactions have been shown to be essential for a number of cellular processes including respiration. If we can find out how to stop bacteria from growing in iron-limited conditions by disrupting protein-protein interactions, we may eventually be able to use this information to discover powerful new antibiotics to which bacteria do not have resistance. Ferric iron is an essential nutrient for most bacteria, but this element is very scarce in the extracellular environment. To obtain scarce yet essential iron, bacteria have developed an iron acquisition strategy that relies on molecules called siderophores. Bacteria synthesize siderophores in the cytoplasm and then secrete them in order to scavenge iron from their environment. To get ferric-siderophores back into the cell, Gram-negative bacteria rely on a network of proteins in the cell envelope to import ferric-siderophores so they can be used for metabolic processes. Although we now know quite a bit about how the proteins in the import network work together to bring ferric-siderophores into the bacterial cell, we still know very little about how proteins work together to make siderophores and secrete them out of the cell. We will characterize the proteins involved in the synthesis and secretion of the E. coli siderophore called enterobactin. By understanding how these proteins work together, we will gain fundamental knowledge that will help us to understand how pathogenic bacteria use siderophores as virulence factors to cause diseases in animals and plants. We want to know if the enterobactin synthesis and secretion proteins communicate with each other through a network of protein-protein interactions, similar to what has already been shown for the proteins involved in ferric-siderophore import. We will try to find out if and how these proteins interact in our controlled laboratory environment by using biophysical techniques. We will also try to solve the three-dimensional structures of these proteins so that we can learn more about the protein surfaces that may tell us how they fit together. Once we know how these proteins can fit together based on our laboratory techniques, we can introduce mutations into these proteins to try to disrupt their interactions in a cell.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Concordia University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Bact�riologie",Microbiologie
"Learning is the process of moving from concrete examples (training data) to models that can explain and predict the underlying process.  Formally learning is the problem of recovering (from the training data) a mapping from input signals to output ones. The accuracy of the mapping to be learned from the data depends on the a priori knowledge of the process. Fully nonparametric learning methods do not need any a priori information and therefore are robust and do not suffer from risk of misspecification. On the other hand they exhibit slow learning rate, which deteriorates considerably with the dimensionality of the underlying objects, e.g., images. In contrast, classical parametric learning algorithms carries a great risk of misspecification, but if they are correctly specified they will enjoy fast learning rates with no deterioration caused by multivariate data. These two basic learning schemes have found numerous applications in such diverse areas as: medical diagnostics, data mining, qualitative economics, communication engineering, speech and pattern recognition. In practice, the dimensionality and sparseness of data force us to accept an intermediate model (semiparametric model) which lies between parametric and fully nonparametric cases. The parametric part of the model defines parameters of finite-dimensional projections of multivariate nonlinearities, whereas nonlinear characteristics run through a nonparametric class of univariate functions. This semiparametric model allows one to design practical learning algorithms which share the efficiency of parametric modeling while preserving the high flexibility of the nonparametric case, i.e., we wish to take the best of both worlds. In fact, in semiparametric models the curse of dimensionality can be entirely eliminated. The purpose of this research is twofold. First we propose to examine theoretical advancements, numerical implementations, and testing the accuracy of specific learning schemes within the aforementioned semiparametric framework. Second, we intend to apply this methodology to concrete cases beyond the traditional AI field such as: signal processing, communication systems, pattern recognition , and image analysis.

"Phosphorus is a key nutrient element for plant growth. Phosphorus-containing minerals, such as apatites, are the main industrial source of this element. Phosphate-bearing ores are first mined and then beneficiated by the froth flotation process in which a phosphate-rich concentrate is produced while the remaining unwanted minerals are rejected as tailings. The flotation concentrate may subsequently be converted into phosphorus-based fertilizers, which are subsequently utilized by the agriculture industry.



As a result of current flotation practices, substantial amounts of valuable fine phosphate minerals are lost in the process as waste. The long-term objective of the proposed collaborative research program is to develop a process through which phosphate fines can be agglomerated with the use of oil into aggregates of larger sizes, which would thus be more amenable to flotation treatment. Since such oil agglomeration of phosphate fines has never been researched, the proposed program has several fundamental objectives, completion of which will enhance our understanding of the process, and of the interfacial phenomena that control it. The experimental program involves detailed characterization of phosphate fines in terms of their mineralogical composition, surface properties (wettability and surface charge), and interactions with selected polymers and agglomerating oils.



The results of this program will not only help with recovering valuable phosphate fines but will also reduce the volume of discharged tailings. This increased technological capacity of the only Canadian phosphate mine to process problematic ores will also extend the life-span of the mine. The new knowledge and technology developed through this project may also have world-wide implications to the standard phosphate processing practice.

"The production of bitumen from the Athabascan oil sands involves a number of unit operations requiring the preparation and handling of oil sand-water slurries. The proposed research program is aimed at characterization of the flow properties (rheology) of oil sand ore suspensions as a function of solids content, water chemistry, and ore composition (primarily mineralogy and bitumen content). The program will also investigate correlations between the rheology of oil sand ore slurries and the extractability of bitumen from the ores. The proposed research will also identify the most critical physicochemical parameters that affect the rheological (flow) behavior of oil sand ores. The results of the proposed program will demonstrate how the rheology of oil sand suspensions can be controlled in order to improve the efficiency of various sub-processes, such the hydrotransport, primary froth separation, and flotation. 



The measurement of the rheology of solid-liquid suspensions is most frequently based on monitoring the resistance of a suspension to flow under applied pressure. Bench-scale rheological measurements will be performed with the use of a rotational viscometer equipped with a special sensor for tests on solid-liquid suspensions. The slump test and the vane technique will also be utilized for measuring the yield stress of highly concentrated ore suspensions. Finally, a flow loop facility will be used for large-scale testing of oil sand suspensions. In combination with a flow visualization system, the flow loop investigations will provide additional information about bitumen liberation under dynamic flow conditions. 



This research program will be one of the first systematic studies on the rheology of oil sand suspensions. The results of this program will therefore be of great value to the Canadian oil sands industry, and to the field of suspension rheology which in itself is a challenging research area.

"The physicochemical methods of mineral processing, such as froth flotation, rely on several related interfacial phenomena occurring at the mineral-solution interface. Polymer and surfactant adsorption, surface charging, particle-air bubble attachment, and aggregation/dispersion of particles are known to be a function of pH and ionic strength. While the term ionic strength has traditionally been used to denote the total electrolyte concentration in processing water, it does not take into account some specific effects, commonly referred to as lyotropic effects, that result from differences in ionic sizes.

In terms of their effect on the surrounding water structure, all ions can broadly be divided into two groups: kosmotropes (water-structure making ions) and chaotropes (water-structure breaking ions). Only recently, has the potential impact of ionic size effects on the interfacial water structure and the associated interfacial phenomena been fully recognized but their significance in mineral processing applications has never been systematically studied. The main long-term objective of the proposed research is to determine the role of lyotropic effects in the fundamental interfacial phenomena, and to demonstrate how such effects can be controlled or manipulated to improve the performance of the froth flotation process.

The experimental program will include a wide range of techniques and methods, from simple batch flotation tests on real ores to advanced spectroscopic and calorimetric studies of the physicochemical properties of mineral surfaces. The proposed research should enhance the industry's ability to treat mineral resources by flotation from process waters of complex chemistries and should also provide guidelines for recycling of high-salinity waste waters. Froth flotation is the most important fine particle processing method. Considering the fact that the mining industry is gradually moving towards recovering unconventional mineral resources (e.g., seafloor deposits), the results of this work will become a valuable source of data about the behavior of such technologically-challenging systems.

"The primary focus of our research program is to design highly automated miniaturized and integrated instrumentation for the isolation of organic materials from complex matrices as well as the subsequent separation, identification and quantification of these species.  The development of new analytical separation methodology for the rapid and efficient determination of organic substances in trace amounts poses a significant challenge to the contemporary analytical chemist and has major implications not only for chemistry but also for the biological and environmental sciences and medicine.  Traditionally, a key component of trace methodology has been slow, labour intensive sampling and sample preparation steps.  We are actively pursuing solvent-free approaches, which can integrate both sampling and sample preparation steps.  We are investigating membrane, needle, and fibre in addition to syringe configurations for this purpose.  A significant, fundamental component of our research is to increase understanding of the extraction processes by developing mathematical models and verifying them using experimental data.  This allows us to develop convenient extraction devices and appropriate calibration procedures.  The major new directions include developing particulate extraction technologies as well as investigating and monitoring single cells and eggs using the micro sampling/sample preparation technologies coupled to micro instrumentation, which have been developed in our group.  The other major direction of the research is to design whole column imaging detection technology for high efficiency capillary separation techniques.  These methods allow simultaneous monitoring of separation in several capillaries and result in short analysis times because of the use of on-line optimization and detection.  On-line investigation of transformation and interactions of analytes is possible providing additional structural information about the analytes.  At present we are applying this technology primarily to capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF) and capillary electrophoresis in combination with absorption and fluorescence imaging. During the project, we will develop imaged multidimensional separation techniques.

"The objective of this proposal is to investigate the fundamental issues involved in the design and implementation of shared controllers and their possible application areas of virtual training environments for surgical and biological sciences, and remote control of robotic systems and design of force feedback (haptic) devices. A virtual training environment consists of a design based on the principles of mechanics, graphics rendering and haptic user interface. One of the training approaches is to provide virtual force guidance (virtual mentoring) to the user. The objective here is to explore methods in constrained computational mechanics for effective modeling and stability analysis of such virtual guidance (e.g. to tie a knot) or constrained motions for the user. A novel shared monitoring/control scheme for the tele-manipulation over the internet will be developed for tele-surgery. Here, the expected position and force can be defined as moving constrained surfaces which can then be estimated using for example a sequential Monte Carlo scheme. Such scheme has been successfully applied to visual tracking of objects when the object can get occluded during its trajectory. In this proposal, the expected feed-forward motion to the slave device and the return feedback force to the master haptic device can be configured in a moving shared control surfaces where despite short black-outs and/or varying time delays, still a robust performance can be accomplished. A conventional approach for designing a haptic device is to interface an open or closed kinematic chain with a high bandwidth actuation mechanism in a form of an impedance device. A novel design concept is to combine an actuating source with an intermediate compliant mechanism which can create a class of low bandwidth haptic feedback along a single degree of freedom. In comparison to utilizing high torque actuators only, such active mechanism can offer an alternative and economical approach for designing a haptic device for various applications (e.g. micro-surgery). Possible approaches for combining the shape and size of the compliant membranes within the electromechanical configuration for creating haptic feedback along many degrees of freedom are the main design challenges.

"Detecting explosive and other dangerous or prohibited substances in an automated and efficient manner became a critical asset to ensure the security of people and properties worldwide. Not only war zones now require such capabilities. Several public institutions such as government buildings, embassies, research centers, military bases, airports, and several critical infrastructures such as power plants or communication centers, are also in need of vehicles or individuals screening systems at their periphery. The lack of a systematic control for all containers that enter or leave port authorities jurisdiction or cross our borders has also been reported as an important security breach by governments in view of the terrorism threat.

While very efficient technologies exist to detect the presence of minute amounts of narcotics or explosive particles, the process of collecting them safely and efficiently, and with systems that can be easily deployed, remains a major challenge. This research will develop efficient and automated sampling procedures through the use of adaptive robotic technologies. The process will be driven by multi-modal sensors to fully automate the particles collection while making it safer for the operators. The technology will reduce the size of necessary equipments to be deployed and will automatically adjust the screening procedure to the diversity of shapes and sizes that come from vehicles of various types, brands and sizes, and from small carriers or large containers. As a result, the technology will provide authorities with a pre-event screening mechanism for explosive and narcotics threats that will be versatile, safe for inspectors, easy to use, and will permit automated scanning of large vehicles and cargo containers with a tele-operated robot working under the guidance of a multi-sensor

system.

La d�tection autonome et efficace de mati�res explosives ou d'autres substances dangereuses ou prohib�es est devenue un �l�ment essentiel dans la protection des individus et des infrastructures � travers le monde. De telles capacit�s ne sont plus requises seulement en zones de guerre. De nombreuses institutions publiques telles que les �difices gouvernementaux, les ambassades, les centres de recherche, les bases militaires, les a�roports, ainsi que plusieurs infrastructures strat�giques comme les centrales d'�nergie et les centres de t�l�communications requi�rent �galement l'implantation de m�canismes de d�tection pour les v�hicules et les individus � leur p�riph�rie. L'absence de contr�le syst�matique des conteneurs qui entrent ou quittent les zones portuaires ou qui traversent nos fronti�res a aussi �t� identifi�e comme une br�che importante � la s�curit� face aux menaces terroristes.

Alors que des techniques tr�s efficaces existent pour la d�tection d'infimes quantit�s de particules explosives ou de narcotiques, le processus de collection de ces particules de mani�re s�curitaire et efficace, et avec des �quipements qui peuvent �tre facilement d�ploy�s, demeure un d�fi majeur. Cette recherche d�veloppera des proc�dures d'�chantillonnage automatis�es faisant appel aux technologies de la robotique. Le m�canisme sera guid� par une combinaison de capteurs afin d'automatiser enti�rement le processus de collecte des particles tout en le rendant s�curitaire pour les op�rateurs. Cette nouvelle technologie r�duira aussi la taille des �quipements devant �tre d�ploy�s et permettra un ajustement autonome de la proc�dure d'�chantillonnage en fonction des caract�ristiques vari�es des v�hicles de diff�rents mod�les et marques, ainsi que des conteneurs de diff�rentes tailles. Cette technologie fournira aux autorit�s des outils de contr�le permettant de d�tecter � l'avance la menace de substances explosives ou de narcotiques. Ces ressources augmenteront consid�rablement la securit� des inspecteurs, seront facile d'emploi et permettront la v�rification syst�matique de grandes surfaces sur des v�hicules et des conteneurs � partir d'un robot t�l�command� et guid� par un syst�me de capteurs multiples.","Information systems and technology","University of Ottawa",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Robotique,Robotique

"Many different oxyanions are found in the soil environment, and the chemistry of these oxyanions is quite varied. Some oxyanions such as phosphate and sulfate are essential nutrients for plant growth and are found in relatively high concentrations in soils. Other oxyanions such as borate are essential for plant growth at low concentrations but become toxic at higher concentrations. A third group of oxyanions, such as arsenate, arsenite, selenate, selenite, and chromate are frequently studied because they have little agronomic use and are instead detrimental to human health at even very low concentrations. 



For all types of oxyanions, understanding how they react with soil surfaces is vital for predicting their bioavailability, toxicity, and transport in natural systems.  This is because chemical reactions that occur at the solid-water interface of soils often control the transport and toxicity of oxyanions.  Detailed understanding of the dynamics of interfacial chemical processes requires advanced molecular-scale spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. For environmental research, a spectroscopic tool must be capable of analyzing samples with normal amounts of water present, at realistic concentrations (typically trace levels), and at ambient pressure. Since soils are a complex matrix of many different solids, a technique must additionally be applicable to heterogeneous mixtures of mineral and organic phases. 



The objective of this proposed research program is to fully develop two new emerging methods of spectroscopy for the study of the environmental chemistry of oxyanions: Time-resolved Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and a newly constructed soft x-ray microprobe beamline (micro-XAS) at the Canadian Light Source.

"In the past, researchers interested in the swimming ability of fish studied individuals that were placed in small ""fish treadmills"". Recent work has shown that these treadmills can cause fish to stop swimming before their muscles become exhausted, which means that fish behaviour is having an effect on the results of the research. This work will study why fish in treadmills stop swimming early, and what scientific principals may be flawed due to the previously unknown occurrence of behavioural fatigue. In addition, the fish treadmills are not very good for measuring high speed swimming, because they are too small for fish to use certain swimming modes that would normally save them energy. As such, we will be studying high speed swimming in long raceways, where fish have room to move and are free to use strategies that save energy, as they do in wild. It is expected that this information will be very useful, as it will be more applicable to wild fish in nature than data from the tests that force fish to swim in the small treadmills.

"The world requires inexpensive, reliable, and sustainable energy sources. Solar photovoltaic technology, which converts sunlight directly into electricity, provides a promising source. This research program aims to enhance characterization and analysis techniques to improve the performance of solar photovoltaic cells. In this research program solar cell efficiencies will be increased using a novel and systematic approach. First, this program will quantify the effects of deposition conditions on the quality, defect state density, type and distribution in thin semiconductor films of indium gallium nitride (InGaN) films and mixed phase amorphous and nanocrystalline silicon (a-Si:H and nc-Si:H).  In the short-term the objectives are to i) create deposition phase diagrams for the InGaN, ii) couple the microstructure of the materials to defect state densities and types, and iii) complete characterization of all layers of a protocrystalline Si solar cell fabricated with mixed phase materials. Then this new information about the material properties will be used in the long-term to develop optimized photovoltaic devices that overcome established obstacles in the technical development of each of these material families. 



This research program will produce higher efficiency and more stable mixed phase Si:H solar cells and will also generate ultra-high efficiency InGaN solar cells using systematic incremental improvements following well-tested successful paths of previous research. These technical improvements all correspond to decreases in economic costs of solar cells, and have the potential to have an enormous positive effect on the Canadian energy supply and economy. As Canadian society transforms itself into a solar powered economy, the HQP trained in this program will be ready to begin working immediately in the growing Canadian solar industry. These students will be better trained to work on the energy solutions for this century in Canada.

"The new Carleton University Centre for Advanced Studies in Visualization and Simulation (V-SIM) is a CFI-funded centre for interdisciplinary research involving the extensive applications of modelling and simulation. The targeted research typically includes interactions with human and/or specialized hardware components, and the simulations are deployed on distributed systems. The resulting style of simulation is a blend of traditional simulation components with distributed real-time systems. The Reality in the Loop lab is located in V-Sim and is focusing on the engineering of this style of simulation. 



The proposed V-SIM Framework and Methodology (V-FAM) research will be based in the Reality in the Loop Lab, but will be useful across a spectrum of projects having different simulation goals. The framework will provide guidance for the underlying organization of the simulation, and will prescribe interaction patterns among simulation components. The development methodology will emphasize component reuse while migrating from general-purpose to target-specific platforms, yet will accommodate the need to integrate and extend components that were not originally designed for a specific simulation's needs. Experiments in V-SIM will provide both the motivation, requirements and setting for this research. Ideally, V-FAM will be an exemplar of best practices for the timely and practical development of interactive distributed simulations.



Modelling and simulation is touted as an influential direction in future applications like national safety, entertainment, rapid prototyping, education, training, and biomedicine. These applications are highly interdisciplinary, yet their success hinges on the engineering capability to develop and deploy distributed simulations. V-FAM research will illuminate and advance the engineering state-of-the-art in this area. The results will be of broad interest to the modelling and simulation community, and of direct interest to DND.

"Ciliated protozoa such as Tetrahymena thermophila are characterized by having two nuclei in the same cell. The polyploid macronucleus (MAC) functions as the cell's somatic nucleus. The diploid micronucleus (MIC) is the cell's germinal nucleus. The MIC undergoes the special cell division called meiosis in this useful and much exploited animal model system. This proposal focuses on molecular studies of meiosis approached from the perspective of genome stability. Some of the areas of focus in this proposal are: 1) Meiosis in Tetrahymena is unusual in two important aspects; there is no synaptonemal complex (SC), a structure generally associated with the highly conserved process of meiosis; and, the elongated crescent structure of chromosomes in meiotic prophase I is very unusual. One can often learn more from studying differences in evolutionarily conserved processes rather than similarities so this system provides a powerful paradigm to address important questions about meiosis. 2) Genome stability is important for the life of an organism. Problems with genome stability can lead to problems including diseases. We will study genome stability through double strand break (DSB) repair. Relationships between DSB repair and DSBs in meiosis will be addressed. 3) DNA in a cell is organized as chromatin, i.e. it is associated with specific small, basic proteins called histones. Histone release and histone deposition is an important aspect of DNA replication. We will address questions about histone deposition focusing on DSB repair and on meiosis. 4) It has been thought that signaling by tyrosine phosphorylation was restricted to multicellular organisms. Recently, evidence has been presented that this pathway exists in unicellular eukaryotes. We have identified a novel tyrosine signaling pathway induced during cell pairing and early stages of mating in Tetrahymena.  This study will have important implications for the evolution and function of tyrosine phosphorylation signaling in development. These studies using an exceptionally useful and versatile animal model organism provide important opportunities to train HQP studying important problems and using and developing state-of-the-art technologies.

"In general, the goal of this research program is to identify the optimal characteristics of ice hockey equipment for performance.  More specifically, this will involve identifying product design, material and construction parameters to positive, desired mechanical outcomes.  This research proposal has been created based on extensive consultation between researchers at McGill and engineers at Nike Bauer Hockey Inc. to ensure that tangible results will be obtain of relevance to their industrial needs.



With respect to the two major product categories (i.e. skates and sticks), we are proposing several studies to evaluate the bio-mechanical (or ergonomic) function of these respective products.  Of particular note, this will involve construction of a synthetic skating surface within a controlled laboratory environment, large enough to permit for natural skating movements and shooting tasks while at the same time enabling for more in depth kinematic and kinetic measurements than possible in field (that is, in ice rink) testing.  To this end, quantities such as skate stroke power and puck shot (projection vector) accuracies, for examples, can be obtained and directly related to the use of ice hockey products.  Stemming from these observations, sporting good manufacturers will have direct empirical data relating skate and stick design, material and construction properties to performance.

"Amongst the most fundamental charateristics of an atomic nucleus are its shape and size whilst in the ground state configuration. As, in general, this is the form in which the nucleus resides for the majority of its lifetime it appears logical to study this in order to further the understanding of nuclear structure away from the stable isotopes.  Laser spectroscopy has long been regarded as a powerful tool in this respect. In all but the lightest of nuclei, it is possible  to extract precise systematic effects along a chain of isotopes without the requirement for in depth knowledge of either the absolute nuclear or  atomic wavefunctions.



Althougth this has been an active area of research ever since the first tuneable laser was installed at a radioactive beam facility over 30 years ago constant improvements in both experimental techniques and the intensities of radioactive beams that are available mean that new, hitherto unexplored areas of the nuclear chart are accessible for the first time.  This proposal sets out a program of such measurements to be performed at the ISAC radioactive beam facility, TRIUMF. By  making use of existing facilities such as the TITAN ion trapping system and material science beta-NMR and beta-NQR it should be possible to perform spectroscopy measurements on ion beams with intensities as low as a few tens of ions per second.

"Among the great variety of plant microbial diseases, fungal diseases cause the largest crop losses worldwide. Although yield losses are attenuated by the use of disease-tolerant plant varieties, application of fungicides is often essential to maximize crop yields. An ongoing concern about pollution and sustainability of agriculture production continues to inspire our research program. Our overall objective is to understand and control plant fungal diseases using environmentally and ecologically sustainable methods. Of particular emphasis in our studies are some of the most important Canadian oilseed crops, canola and rapeseed, as well as vegetables like cauliflower, broccoli, rutabaga, and their most damaging fungal pathogens. Towards this end we are analyzing plants stressed by various types of fungal pathogens and comparing the natural products produced. For example, we have uncovered canola ""blackleg"" fungi that produce potent chemical weapons called phytotoxins to destroy plant cells and allow pathogens to obtain nutrients. In other cases, a canola ""rust"" fungus appears to be subtler and is able to trick the plant to make compounds that are less potent and allow their quick spread. Furthermore, many pathogens of canola and mustard can overcome the plants' chemical defences by breaking them down. Importantly, we found that a few natural plant products can stop this process, thus we may be able to stop the pathogen using similar bioproducts. On the other hand, we have discovered that mustard plants are able to counter attack fungal infection by breaking down the phytotoxins produced by the invader and thus prevent colonization. In summary, our research is providing ground-breaking contributions to the development of strategies for the control of fungal diseases of canola and related plants. The farming industry and all public (indeed the world community) will benefit if our work can contribute to protect agricultural crops and facilitate sustainable agriculture practices. In carrying out this research, we are training highly qualified people, essential in many Canadian institutions, including the agricultural, pharmaceutical, and food industries, a great additional benefit to our community.",Agriculture,"University of Saskatchewan",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Chimie bio-organique","Chimie organique"

"The challenges in prevention of disasters, especially those associated with terrorism acts are immense and extremely timely. As of today, we witness a wave of rapidly developing highly sophisticated and diversified threats. Fortunately, there is a potential of exploiting a wealth of methodologies and relevant technologies that could bring effective means of counteracting those malicious activities. They support expectations with this regard so that the abilities of exploiting mechanisms of information technology to alleviate the problems in an efficient and effective manner are put in place. Sound mechanisms of recognition of individuals or groups of individuals are crucial to the prudent confinement of potential threats.

Within the area of biometrics, face recognition techniques have occupied a highly visible role owing to a balanced approach when tacking several delicate matters including a formation of a sound tradeoff between high effectiveness (an ability to recognize individuals) and compliance with privacy issues. The role of innovative information technologies in biometrics, especially those emerging under the banner of Computational Intelligence (CI) and pattern recognition has been promising and these technologies have already demonstrated their potential. What makes the development of biometric systems and face recognition classification even more demanding are the rapidly growing databases of faces which substantially challenge existing classification schemes and calls for radical changes of the design methodology and further augmentation of the existing algorithmic framework.

If the above challenges can be adequately addressed, it is evident that the construction of user-centric intelligent systems could bring a lot of tangible benefits. In close collaboration with our industrial partner, Global Biometrics which has an outstanding track record in the area of face recognition we will be bringing an advanced research methodology of face recognition and their related algorithmic developments.

This proposal spans two key research topics within the Safety and Security target area: Event Detection and Risk and Vulnerability. The ultimate objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive methodology of face classification and produce a comprehensive algorithmic suite by taking advantage of the technology of Computational Intelligence and pattern recognition. The resulting prototype of a classification system will be extremely helpful in drawing sound conclusions of immediate practical relevance as to the suitability of some typical methods and their augmentation in presence of huge collections of faces involving thousands of individuals. Such a challenge, even though of significant practical relevance, has never been fully explored in the past.","Information, computer and communication technologies","University of Alberta",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Technologie de l'information","Technologie de l'information"

"Many technologically, medically, and environmentally important materials consist of a porous matrix filled with water (e.g., bone, cartilage, wood, oil and water bearing rocks, soil, cement and concrete).  In order to understand the behaviour of such porous media (e.g., durability, fluid transport, ion transport, biophysical characteristics where applicable) it is necessary to understand the behaviour of water within the pore network.  To advance our knowledge about the state of water in porous media we are using MCM-41, a mesoporous material with pores of well defined shape and diameter as a model system.  Both low-field NMR relaxation approaches and high-field solid state NMR techniques are employed in this research.  Our initial research on the hydration dynamics in MCM-41 has already naturally led to our involvement in a project aimed at developing a new, efficient and cost effective groundwater remediation scheme, based on MCM-41, that removes halogenenated hydrocarbons (e.g. trichloroethylene or TCE).  

     Our earlier NMR research on the behaviour of water in cartilage tissue has pointed to the feasibility of using specific NMR relaxation parameters in the in-vivo detection of early (pre-clinical symptom) osteoarthritis using MRI.  A part of this proposal involves testing this on our micro MRI system.  If such early detection can be brought to the clinical setting the possible benefits are substantive because pre-clinical detection is expected to allow for application of treatment protocols, which can delay clinical symptoms by a decade or more.

"The infrared spectra of almost all objects in space are dominated by strong emission features due to large carbonaceous molecules, i.e. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs).  As a class, PAHs are the most complex and most abundant molecules known in space and play a crucial role in various processes such as the abundances of other elements, the cooling and heating of the interstellar medium etc. In addition, they may well have played an important role in the prebiotic evolution of life. Hence, studying these large, abundant interstellar molecules, their formation and evolution and the astrobiological processes that control their abundance is of tremendous importance for our understanding of the universe around us and our cosmic roots.  



The proposed research focuses on these large carbonaceous molecules with the ultimate goal  of using their emission features as a diagnostic tool to study the characteristics of the environments where they reside. Due to their omnipresence, this diagnostic tool can then be used for a large number of galactic objects and galaxies in space. For example, these PAH emission bands are used as tracers of star formation activity, which is essential to understand the evolution of galaxies and hence our universe. In order to achieve this, we first have to understand the  behaviour of PAHs in space, in particular, how they evolve during their life cycle and how they interact with the environment. This can be achieved through comparison of the PAH characteristics with known properties (such as radiation field, density etc.) of well-studied objects which is the main goal of this proposal.

"In underground coal mining or iron sulfide operations as well as many industrial facilities, combustible dust layers accumulate on floors, horizontal ledges, surfaces of machinery, and above false ceilings. Dust layers can easily be lifted into suspension by weak explosions or pressure waves. Some examples of typical causes are a small methane gas explosion in an underground mine, the blast wave from an explosive charge in a sulfide mine operation, cleaning operations, a strong gust of wind because of an open window or door in a processing plant, or a leak from a compressed gas system. Once a dust cloud is created, there is always a high probability of ignition leading to a flash fire or a propagating dust explosion. Furthermore, if the dust cloud is formed within a confined space that contains obstacles, the propagating dust flame will accelerate, possibly leading to a dust-to-detonation transition. Therefore, this research program focuses on understanding and modelling the dust lifting process. The overall long-term objective is to better predict the dust explosion hazard and thereby develop strategies to prevent them from occurring or to mitigate their consequences. The experimental program will investigate the mechanism of dust lifting as a function of the nature of the particles (density, type and shape), thickness of the dust layer, particle size distribution; shock wave propagation velocity; and presence of obstacles. Some experiments will be done in a standard 20-L dust explosion chamber to better understand the dispersion of non-standard dusts (e.g. low density cellulosic fibers) which are currently not well-understood. Additionally, experiments in a purpose built shock tube will allow high-speed Schlieren photography for visualization of the dust lifting process. All these experiments will enable development of a suitable model to describe the dust lifting, dispersion, and mixing process for implementation in a Dust Explosion Simulation Code. This simulation code will allow prediction of explosibility characteristics from standard testing of various dusts as well as prediction of the dust explosion hazard within process equipment and facilities.

"Many Web pages contain tabular data, such as a Web page on a shopping Web site using a table to compare multiple products.  Relatively, tabular data has better structure and quality.  Therefore, extracting and labeling tabular data on the Web plays an important role in Web search.  Many social search software products on Internet and enterprise intranets need a powerful module in extracting and tagging tabular data.  However, extracting tabular data is far from straightforward since table tags in HTML Web pages are frequently used for layout formatting and some other purposes.  Although there exist some studies on extracting tabular data on the

Web, three important issues remain unsolved.  First, there is no large benchmark data sets to objectively evaluate the performance of tabular data extraction methods.  Second, while most of the existing methods use simple heuristics and employ supervised learning approaches, classification models learned from a specific training data set may likely carry bias on the learning instances, and thus may not be robust to extracting tabular data from other Web pages that are not represented well in the training set.  Last, there is no existing work on automatically tagging tabular data at both the table level and the column level.

In this project, we will develop effective techniques to extract and tag tabular data on the Web.  First, we will provide several labeled benchmark tabular data sets crawled from many Web sites. The data sets will consist of Web pages containing both data tables and layout tables. Moreover, the data sets will cover many domains as well as Web sites with various popularity of tabular data.  Second, we will develop a tabular data extraction method and a prototype system to automatically capture tabular data components on Web pages and transform tabular data into spreadsheets. Different from the existing methods, our approach is not a supervised learning approach.  Instead, we want to explore the language model of a table as well as the language models of the columns.  Third, we will develop a tagging method to generate tags for an extracted table as well as the columns in the table, which can be used in advanced Web search and data integration.","Computer software","Simon Fraser University",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Gestion de bases de donn�es","Technologie de l'information"
"Uncertain data are inherent in some important applications, such as environmental surveillance using sensor netoworks, market analysis using customer surveys, and quantitative economics research. Uncertain data in those applications are generally caused by factors like data randomness and incompleteness, limitations of measuring equipment, delayed data updates, etc. For example, sensors are often used to detect presence of endangered, threatened, or special concern risk categories of animals in remote or preserved regions. Due to limitations of sensors, detections cannot be accurate all the time. Instead, detection confidence is often estimated to model uncertainty. Analyzing and mining uncertain data collected from such sensors can enable biologists to capture and understand interesting behavior patterns of wild animals. 

As sensor network technology becomes mature and economical, in the near future, many large sensor networks will be deployed to monitor our broad homeland and environment, including forests, glaciers, and bodies of water. The knowledge from such uncertain data will be essential for Canada and BC to deal with many grand environmental and social challenges such as global warming and its consequences, environment and natural resource conservation, homeland security, and safe working environment. Analyzing large collections of uncertain data has become an important task. 

The objectives of this project are to systematically investigate the models of effective and practical analytic queries and mining tasks, develop efficient methods, and apply such techniques to emerging uncertain data intensive applications such as sensor networks and Web mining. Doctoral and Master's graduate students will be trained to answer the emerging demand for highly qualified personnel equipped with the expertise in uncertain data processing. Uncertain data processing will also be introduced into advanced undergraduate and graduate databases courses. Research results will be widely disseminated by publications in major conferences and journals. Tutorials will be delivered to major conferences, too.

The automotive industry has long-term goals in vehicle-weight reduction for fuel economy, performance and reduced emissions, which need to be balanced with cost targets and reliability.  The growing CO2 emissions from the transportation sector currently contribute 25% of Canada's total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the government has targeted a 45-65%reduction in GHGs by 2050.  



Magnesium and aluminum offer attractive weight-reduction opportunities, especially if used in the heaviest components of the vehicle such as the powertrain (engine and transmission). The powertrain requires creep-resistant alloys that can withstand 200C/100MPa service conditions. The applicant, Prof. Pekguleryuz, has been conducting research in creep resistant magnesium alloys since 1991, one of which, the AJ62 (Mg-6Al-2Sr) alloy has been commercialized by BMW, for use on all BMW hybrid engine blocks (Mg block with Al insert) in the 300, 600, 700, and E series, which is a breakthrough in the use of Mg in the powertrain. The co-applicant, Prof. Hu, has also been involved in diecast Mg creep resistant alloys since the 90s. His main research area is Mg-Al-Ca alloys. New generation of Mg and Al alloys with improved creep resistance are needed for use in monolithic Mg engine, Al diesel engine, light aircraft engine and nuclear reactors.  This project will develop performant lightweight and creep resistant alloys for elevated temperature service in automotive, aerospace and nuclear industries.

"This project proposal is for the development of new aluminum alloys with improved high-temperature performance (creep resistance, strength, ductility, thermal fatigue resistance and castability) as well as acceptable cost to be used in automotive Diesel engine applications for vehicle weight reduction and environmental benefits. The Diesel engine, introduced by Rudolph Diesel in 1892, achieves self ignition via fuel injection into air which is already compressed in the combustion chamber. Compared to gasoline engines, the Diesel achieves a higher combustion ratio and higher fuel efficiency. The Diesel has 30%lower CO2 emissions per mile and is considered one of the most viable environmentally friendly technologies for vehicles. Market penetration of the Diesel in Europe shows substantial growth since 1991 reaching 50% (70% in  France) market share; while in North America it sees slow acceptance (1% cars and 4% light trucks) due to past experience with older technologies and sulfur-containing fuel usage. However, ""clean Diesel"" using lower sulfur content fuel has become available since 2006. US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers the Diesel an extremely attractive technology to help achieve EPA's future standards. Tax incentives ($3500 credit) for buyers of new Diesels are offered in the US since April 2006. Currently, the Diesel engine and cylinder head are mostly cast iron due to the high compression pressures and temperatures occurring in Diesel operation. Further weight reduction via Al substitution would result in substantial fuel economy and increased environmental benefits. 10% saving in vehicle weight leads to 6-8% fuel economy which translates (during the life time of a car) to 17-20 kg reduced emissions of CO2, per kg of vehicle weight reduced. Only a small portion of the diesel is aluminum and the increasing torque requirements in newer common rail turbo diesels necessitate new alloys with improved performance under thermal fatigue conditions. In this project novel aluminum alloys will be developed to meet the requirements of the Diesel technology.","Transportation systems and services","McGill University",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Science et technologie des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"

"Modern polymeric and self-assembled materials often present complex hierarchical structures, from nanometers to millimeters. The design and production of materials with properties targeted for specific applications thus requires a better than ever characterization of their structure. In this context, our research seeks to improve our understanding of the relationships between the processing conditions, the structure, and the properties of polymers and self-assembled materials. Our work focuses on two types of systems: polymer mixtures and self-assembled complexes between polymers and small molecules. We prepare thick and ultrathin (nano)films of these materials and we characterize them under both static and perturbed conditions. For instance, we apply mechanical deformations to samples to simulate the effect of industrial processing methods. We also use electrospinning to prepare new fibers with diameters much below that of conventional fibers. We seek to prepare fibers showing unusual or easily controllable properties. 



To reach our goals, we use a wide range of characterization techniques such as spectroscopy, microscopy, etc. Nevertheless, conventional techniques do not always allow proper characterization of the systems dynamics. A second aspect of our research is thus the development of novel advanced infrared spectroscopy techniques. Our new instruments will enable such dynamic studies with time resolutions in the microsecond regime that are not currently possible. We believe that the fundamental knowledge and the instrumental developments resulting from this program will help designing new materials with optimized performances. In addition, the many students involved in this research will become highly qualified scientists able to contribute rapidly and significantly to the advancement of Canada's research and industry.

"Les approches d'ordonnancement de projet visent � optimiser l'allocation d'un nombre restreint de ressources aux diff�rentes activit�s d'un projet.  Bien que plusieurs mod�les ont �t� pr�sent�s dans la litt�rature scientifique, rares sont ceux qui se penchent sur l'allocation de ressources d�di�es � des activit�s de projet conduites dans un environnement manufacturier. L'�tablissement d'un �ch�ancier de projet y est alors complexe compte tenu que ces ressources doivent aussi ex�cuter des op�rations de production.   

Dans ce contexte, la fonction de planification de projets se heurte au domaine de la production en raison des nombreuses diff�rences qui opposent ces deux environnements. D'une part, la fonction de planification de projets a une dur�e de vie limit�e alors que la gestion de la production repr�sente une s�quence d'activit�s en continue. Contrairement aux op�rations de production, les activit�s de projet sont uniques, ponctuelles, souvent incertaines et contr�l�es sommairement par l'utilisation de jalons.

"The computational engineering group (GRMIAO) at �cole Polytechnique de Montr�al is one of the largest Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) research unit in Canada. Its members are internationally recognized experts with very strong publication records in CFD. Their research is driven by the need for tools to analyze and improve the performance of mechanical products and systems. The flows around airplane wings, in hydraulic turbine components and in medical devices are but a few examples. The GRMIAO research covers the full spectrum of CFD and Multi-Disciplinary Optimization (MDO) activities. Its members are active on fundamental issues such as algorithm development, code prototyping and verification/validation activities. They also develop methodologies to attack fluid mechanics problems of industrial relevance and develop design optimization methods involving one or many disciplines to optimize the performance of these systems. This broad spectrum of activities places special demands on the computational environment. Mid-level servers are requested which are flexible enough to efficiently run commercial software while providing a productive environment for code development and prototyping of flow solvers. This proposal requests the funds to acquire four mid-level servers to replace our old and obsolete servers and provide our group (25-30 graduate students and 7-9 research assistants) with sufficient computing power and memory to maintain international leadership in CFD. The present grant application is the third and last phase of a structured strategy to renew our computational infrastructure. The present RTI is for the central components of our computational infrastructure and is the cap stone to two other sources of funds secured prior to submitting this application. A CFI Team award (Garon as PI) has funds earmarked for acquisition of substantial amounts of high speed disks to store PIV measurement and CFD prediction data files. We have also earmarked $30,000 or about 18% of the total cost of the requested servers through an FQRNT Team equipment grant (Guibault as PI).

"Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) plays an increasingly important role in engineering. Its uses range from the analysis of the flow around an airplane to the analysis of manufacturing processes (injection molding, die casting). Engineers must answer two questions when performing CFD analyses: does the computer model yield accurate solutions? and are the solutions physically realistic? Our research will provide  theories and tools to answer these two questions.



A first axis of research on ADAPTIVE METHODS will provide a framework for automating accuracy control of CFD results. Physical realism of a CFD simulation is usually  assessed by comparing CFD predictions to experimental data. The difficulty in this task lies in the fact that both predictions and measurments suffer from uncertainty. For experiments, this is due to measurement accuracy and data processing techniques. For predictions, there are two sources of errors: discretization errors (controled through adaptivity) and uncertainties in the data input to the CFD model (manufacturing tolerances, operating conditions, etc.). A second axis of our research on SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS will develop theory and techniques to produce quantified uncertainty estimates of the CFD predictions. Finally, our research on SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS will yield new tools for engineering analysis and design. They will allow engineers to identify key parameters controlling the flow response, thus allowing them to focus their efforts on innovative designs and new approaches to control the behavior of complex flows rather than on tedious and time consuming analysis. 



Our proposed approach offers excellent perspective of success as it constitutes a natural and logical extension of existing procedures used by engineers and designers.

"The long-term goal of my research program is to understand how ecological and evolutionary processes interact to shape phenotypic diversity and to determine the importance of evolutionary processes in driving fluctuation in size of wild mammal populations. My program is based on four longitudinal studies of marked individuals (between 14 and 35 years) with detailed data on age-specific survival, recruitment, phenotypic traits (such as body mass and age at first reproduction) and environmental conditions for entire cohorts. My research is innovative and multi-disciplinary; integrating theory from population biology and evolutionary ecology to analyze exceptionally detailed long-term datasets to understand the causes of population fluctuations and their consequences for natural selection. In the next five years, my students and I will i) identify climatic drivers affecting the population dynamics of five marked mammal populations, ii) evaluate the relative importance of ecological and evolutionary processes in generating population dynamics iii) investigate the consequences of environmental variation on the opportunity of, the strength of and the response to selection and iv) explore the effects of phenotypic plasticity in reproductive timing on population growth. By analyzing how the opportunity for and the strength of selection changes with ecological variation, my research will provide new insights on how the environment affects the evolutionary potential of wild species. Those insights will ultimately be keys in assessing how human-driven changes affect the abundance and persistence of wild populations.

The issues involved in my more immediate goals can be divided into three separate arenas, together with the overarching aim of fitting them all together.  The arenas are: (a) knowledge representation, (b) natural language semantics and semantic information processing, and (c) automated theorem proving.  A main goal is the continued development of a logically and conceptually nice interface among these three areas in some limited domains (e.g., areas where the information contained in natural language sentences that involve vagueness or quantifier underspecification). Each of these domains has its own independent interest, and the thread that ties them together (and which is the main thrust of my research) is the notion of inference.  In each of these realms, we are to envisage how some agent can take information of the sort relevant to that field and legitimately draw relevant conclusions.

  The general methodology I continue to pursue involves a study of how one or another of these phenomena manifests itself in language or in human performance, and then moves to a formal characterization (usually in terms of a logical system, focusing especially on the notion of inference within that system), followed by an implementation phase.  This last phase is then followed by an evaluation of how well it stacks up to human performance.   All in all there is a symboisis among human performance, formal characterization, and machine performance -- all in the realm of inference (in its many manifestations).

"The complex interplay between amino acids at the active site of enzymes results in high catalytic power and specificity. As a result of this complexity, there remains much to be done in order to extend our knowledge from specific examples to general rules. The benefits of better understanding enzyme catalysis are numerous: in our laboratory, we are gaining a better understanding of enzyme-based drug resistances and we are modifying enzymes for their application to organic synthesis. Our research program combines powerful molecular biological methodologies with computer-assisted protein molecular modelling to explore the fundamentals of enzyme catalysis. We combinatorially mutate active-site amino acids that are involved in substrate binding, creating large libraries of mutated enzymes from which we select the subset of functional ones. We characterize the new enzymes with respect to their kinetics, their structure and their dynamics to correlate active-site structure with function.  

           We are studying two enzymes involved in drug-resistance: 1) TEM-1 beta-lactamase: The high rate of clinical occurrence of beta-lactamases capable of hydrolysing widely-used antibiotics such as penicillins underscores the urgency of better defining the molecular nature of enzyme-based antibiotic resistance. We propose an original approach to gain insight into the relation between protein dynamics and function within beta-lactamases: does the conservation of function correlate with conservation of dynamics? Establishing a linkage between internal motions and catalysis will help us understand the rapid development of resistance. 2) R67 Dihydrofolate Reductase: It has been suggested that the active site cavity of this reductase is a 'binding hot-spot' of relatively low specificity. We will modify and exploit this 'hot-spot' to create new stereospecific reductases for efficient preparation of synthetically-useful chiral intermediates. Our projects will contribute to advancing our capacity in enzyme engineering.

"Cells need to grow and divide in all living organisms. Prior to division, cells must duplicate every single chromosomes once and only once. During cell division, the process in which one cell becomes two cells, a copy of each chromosome must be transmitted to each daughter cell.  Defects in the accurate transmission of chromosomes to progeny is responsible for the development and progression of cancer and other chromosome related diseases such as Down's syndrome. Dr. Pelletier's laboratory uses microscopes to identify and study centrosomes, an important part of the cellular machine that mediate the accurate transmission of chromosome to progeny during cell division. Although many novel and exciting genes implicated in the regulation of centrosome function have been identified, their bilogy remain incompletely understood. Dr. Pelletier has recently identified an additional protein required for centrosome funtion, called FAM29A, that plays a major role in regulating centrosome biology.  To study this exciting new protein, Dr. Pelletier's group will use state-of-the art microscopes that will enable them to follow, in living cells, the biology of centrosomes, the behavior of FAM29A as well as the impact of centrosome defects on the accurate segregation of chromosomes.  Their study will lead to a better understanding of how centrosome defects are linked to cancer progression, developmental disorders and other diseases. In addition to the health benefits due to a better comprehension of centrosome function in mammalian cells, Dr. Pelletier's pioneering work will have indirect effects on Canadian health by enabling other researchers in Canada to apply the technologies developed in his laboratory to their own biologically relevant systems.","Medical and health sciences","University of Toronto",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Biologie cellulaire","Biologie cellulaire"

"In-vivo, cells are constantly subjected to mechanical forces from the contraction of muscle, air and blood flow as well as cellular forces arising from mitosis and migration. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the cellular micro-environment have been shown to have direct consequences on the fate of stem cells, malignant transformation, myogenesis and mitosis. These aspects of cell biology are relatively new and although mechanical properties of the micro-environment and mechanical forces are linked to cell biology, the underlying mechanisms of cellular force transduction and response pathways remain unclear. In this research program, we will delve into the physical and molecular mechanisms which govern the transduction and generation of mechanical forces. Utilizing state of the art biophysical and genetic approaches we will develop a mechanistic 3D structure-function understanding of the early deformation and remodelling processes of the cell in response to mechanical force in real time. Taking advantage of technologies only available in the Pelling Lab, we will be able to address a gap in knowledge by investigating these new aspects of cell biology in a world class training environment. The heavy investment in infrastructure to establish a highly integrated interdisciplinary training environment will enable highly qualified personnel (HQP) to learn the theoretical and practical aspects of cell/molecular biology, microscopy, image analysis/computation and biophysics. HQP will work and collaborate within an interdisciplinary laboratory, gaining highly transferable skills for later careers in academia or industry. HQP who are fluent in the languages of biology and physics are central to the objectives of this research program as well as any eventual downstream applications of this work which may range in applications from the early mechanical detection of diseases, activation of biological pathways and controlling cell behaviour.

"The most common form of play in non-human animals is 'rough-and-tumble play' or 'play fighting', which is a non-injurious form of competitive interaction, where partners compete for some advantage over one another, such as being able to bite their partner gently. Behavioural mechanisms exist that reduce the risk of play fighting escalating into serious fighting; this makes the repeated bodily contact found in play rewarding. When animals, such as rats, are deprived, in the juvenile period, of the opportunity to engage in peer-peer play, they develop into socially incompetent adults. My work has shown that if certain areas of the brain are damaged, such as the prefrontal cortex, rats exhibit social deficits as if they had been deprived of play. The anatomy of the neurons in these areas of the prefrontal cortex is modified when varying the experience the animals have in play as juveniles. Therefore, I theorize that experience with play fighting as juveniles is necessary for the development of those areas of the brain that are critical for social competency. In the proposed research, I will use laboratory rats to investigate what aspects of the play experience are critical for the development of the brain and characterize the mechanisms by which a more competent social brain executes more competent social behaviour. For instance, when deciding how best to respond to a partner, it is important to take into account both its identity and its actions, and my data suggest that these two facets are encoded in different areas of the prefrontal cortex. I will also conduct a comparative analysis of play in a diverse range of primates to determine whether the organization of play fighting differs among species depending on the complexity of their social behaviour. Again, my preliminary findings suggest that those species with more complex problems to solve in their societies have patterns of play as juveniles that seem appropriate for training them to make quick and varied actions. These studies will characterize how social competence develops and the contribution made to this development by the experience of play as juveniles.","Advancement of knowledge","University of Lethbridge",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Psychologie,Psychologie

"The research for which this proposal seeks continuing support addresses issues in mathematical geophysics on the one hand and in the fluid mechanics of atmospheric, oceanic and solid Earth processes on the other, areas that intersect in work on climate dynamics and climate system history.  An example of such intersection is embodied in the unique theory I have developed to describe the deformations of planetary shape and accompanying variations in sea level caused by the Late Quaternary glacial cycle.  The predictions of this model have been dramatically confirmed by the time-dependent gravity field observations provided by the GRACE satellites that remain in space.  A further refined version of the model is being produced for the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP3) in work leading to the next IPCC report.  This will include an improved representation of the depth dependence of mantle viscosity and a better constrained model of Eurasian deglaciation.  The data sets produced will be employed by my own group and internationally in new coupled simulations of climate variability from Last Glacial Maximum to Holocene.  Production work is also beginning on application of the now complete new three dimensional spherical numerical models of the general circulation of the mantle of the Earth and the atmospheric weather layers of the Gas Giant planets, the former directed towards improving our understanding of the impact of pressure induced phase transitions on the radial mixing length, and the latter towards providing an understanding of the origin and stability of the zonal jets that dominate the pole-to-pole variations of mean-flow velocity observed to characterize these objects.  This work on Gas Giant zonal flows is leading towards the development of a new non-hydrostatic dry dynamical core that may be substituted for those used in more conventional atmospheric GCM's.  On smaller spatial scales and in the area of pure fluid mechanics, I have begun a new project on the efficiency with which fully three-dimensional turbulence may act non-diffusively in mixing a mean density stratification, work that speaks to the way in which such turbulent processes should be ""parameterized"" in large-scale models.

"I am a co-founder of the FactSage system which is among the largest database computing systems in chemical thermodynamics, with 400 users worldwide in materials science, ceramics, geology, corrosion, metallurgy, combustion, energy, glass technology, etc.  Users access large evaluated databases for the thermodynamic properties of hundreds of multicomponent solutions of metals, oxides, salts, sulphides, etc. which we have prepared by critical evaluation/optimization of all available literature data for thermodynamic properties and phase equilibria to obtain the parameters of models which best express all the properties simultaneously.  



    )	Over the past 30 years I have developed the Modified Quasichemical Model for short-range-ordering to relate the thermodynamic properties of a solution to its atomic and molecular structure.  This model is used in all the FactSage databases for liquid solutions of alloys, oxides, salts, sulphides, etc. and is generally recognized as the most successful model for such solutions.  Current developments include the proper inclusion of long-range forces, improvements to the modeling and prediction of miscibility gaps, and application to modeling (long-range) order-disorder phenomena, dissolution of water, carbonates, sulphates, fluorides, etc. in molten oxides, and oxide solutions containing borates and phosphates.  These refinements will significantly extend the applicability of the model and the number of systems in the databases, and will consolidate most of the current sublattice models of solutions into one unified model.  This application is for funding to complete the Modified Quasichemical Model.

"Innovative new products can arise from the unusual application of familiar materials.  Our industrial partner, Alcon Canada, has done this.  They employed derivatives of guar, well known materials from plants, in artificial tear products giving far better results than conventional additives.  The overall goal of the McMaster/Alcon research partnership is to understand what is special about guar and how we can make it even better by structural  modification.  The research will determine how guar derivatives interact with materials similar to those present in tears and on the exposed surfaces of the eye.   Understanding how to control guar interactions with proteins and other components in the eye will point the way to new and better products.  From a broader scientific perspective, the research will increase our understanding of labile  polyelectrolytes, which are fascinating materials that regulate their structure in response to the local environment.

"This project is aimed at achieving directed assembly in paper fabrication leading to novel, high value added products.   In particular, we are interested in modifications which exploit the superior properties of northern softwood bleached pulp.  The project is directed toward the initial development of three new technology platforms for the manufacture of paper and nonwovens.  

Conventional paper structures are the result of the electrostatically controlled deposition of particles and polymers onto surfaces in an aqueous dilute pulp suspension followed by filtration on the papermachine.  In spite of the continued development of large, expensive papermachines, the range of possible paper structures is rather limited.  Consequently, the most demanding paper and paper board applications require secondary processing with multi-step coating and calendering operations to give the desired optical, physical and printing properties.  

Our vision is that by suitable control of interacting surfaces in the papermaking suspension it will ultimately be possible to produce innovative paper products without secondary processing.   By selectively manipulating structure and surface chemistry such control will give far more exotic properties than are currently achievable.  A conventional example would be the production of a product equivalent to a coated paper without using a coater.  More exotic possibilities might result from the self-assembly of inexpensive photonic crystals on paper surfaces.  Both of these examples require the independent control of structure and surface chemistry in an environment compatible with the nature and scale of papermaking technology.  

We plan to make use of what Nature has taught us about the assembly of complex structures-  the exquisite specificity of the interactions and the flexibility afforded by multiple interaction sites on a given species.

"This proposal builds on the theoretical ground work built in the current discovery grant cycle, which resulted in a detailed simulation study with new codes and tools to study the Epoch of Reionization (EoR).  That cycle also funded the initial observing investments with the Indian Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope(GMRT), which resulted in a new interference resistant software signal processor and an international collaboration agreement.



Now, the primary focus is the search for the Epoch of Reionization.  This project is currently leading the international effort, with a steady stream of GMRT data.  The competition (LOFAR in the Netherlands, MWA and PAPER in Australia with US Funding) is rapidly catching up.  This proposal plans to maintain the international lead on this new window of discovery.  In addition, the proposal continues the computational astrophysics effort developed over the years into the SciNet era of computational infrastructure.  This includes cosmological simulations to constrain dark matter and dark energy, and MHD simulations of black hole accretion.

"Canada contains approximately 10% of the world's forests and approximately 25% of world's boreal forests. Climate change and resultant increased ecosystem disturbances are expected to significantly alter future boreal forest growth and production, wood supply, and greenhouse gas budget in Canada. Under the Kyoto Protocol, Canada has agreed to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 6% from 1990 levels by 2010. There is an urgent need to develop a better scientific understanding and to quantify impacts of future climate change and the associated ecosystem disturbances on Canadian boreal forest ecosystems.

 

The central objective of this research program is to develop and use state-of-the-art of computer simulation models to investigate the impacts of future climate change and associated ecosystem disturbances on forest growth, wood supply and carbon budget of boreal forests in eastern Canada. This program will develop an innovative and ""made-in-Canada"" approach to address the increasingly important issues of climate change mitigation and adaptation as well as greenhouse gas emission reduction targets of the Kyoto Protocol.



This project will train highly qualified personnel (including two Masters students, one Ph.D. student and one Postdoctoral student). The project outputs would fill the information gap for foresters, forest managers, and policy-makers from federal agencies, local governments, forest industry and private companies to assist them in contributing to the ongoing Kyoto Protocol negotiations, and developing carbon-based indicators for sustainable forest management, mitigation and adaptation strategies in Canada.

"Animal reproductive functions require precise hormonal control. Members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family have been found to play important roles in regulating ovarian functions; however, their precise physiological roles are not fully understood. We have been studying the structure and function of several members of the TGF-beta family and demonstrated that activin stimulates, while TGF-beta and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-15 inhibit, maturation of eggs in the zebrafish ovary. In the next five years, we will continue to use zebrafish as a model to address the following questions: 1) what are the physiological significance of activin, TGF-beta and BMP-15 in egg maturation and ovulation? 2) how do these factors regulate egg maturation? 3) what modulates the expression and activities of these factors? We will first use gain- and loss-of-functions approaches to determine the physiological roles of activin, TGF-beta, and BMP-15.  We will test if these factors regulate egg maturation mainly by regulating the responsiveness of eggs to maturation-inducing hormones. Finally, we will examine how the production and activity of these factors are controlled by other hormones and by a group of small RNAs, known as microRNA.  The proposed studies will provide novel insight into the regulation, actions, and signaling pathways of the TGF-beta family in the ovary. They will enhance our overall understanding of vertebrate reproduction.  Finally, these studies may also have potential application into aquaculture.

"The proposed research is to study hydrodynamic responses of multiple-body interaction in shallow water waves. The first objective is to accurately model the nonlinear shallow water waves in the time domain. The second objective is to compute the nonlinear interactions of multiple bodies in close proximity in shallow water waves. The research aims to identify, quantify and reduce the risk of motion failure because of the interaction between multiple bodies.



The hydrodynamic interaction is significant for ships or floating bodies operated in shallow water waves, such as a vessel passing a moored ship in the restricted harbor and a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) carrier during offloading operation.The low-frequency long waves in shallow water have significant effect on the ship motions and related mooring line analysis. Moored LNG carriers with their inherent low damping characteristics can be very sensitive to small amounts of low frequency wave energy in shallow water.  In this proposal, the hydrodynamic response of multiple-body interaction in shallow water will be investigated. Nonlinear shallow water waves will be modeled by solving the Boussinesq equations. A time-domain ship motion program will be developed to predict the hydrodynamic response of multiple-body interaction in close proximity. The resonance phenomenon due to the gap between the bodies will also be studied.



The proposed research will be a significant contribution to the field of marine hydrodynamics. Through this research, nonlinear behavior of multiple-body interaction associated with nonlinear shallow water waves will be well modeled in the time domain. The research will result in an efficient numerical simulation package which will benefit both the academic community and port design, shipping industry and the oil and gas development.

"When you go to the pharmacy and fill a prescription up, have you ever wondered if the dose of the drug is right for you? Can the dose be too low so that  the  drug  will not work? Can the dose be too high that it may cause some side effects? Have you ever thought   about  how  Health Canada makes a decision to approve or to reject a new drug? Some of these questions can be answered by dose-response and toxicity studies in this research.  For example, dose-response studies are useful in Phase II and Phase III clinical trials to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of a drug in order to determine its effective and safe ranges. A zero dose is generally included as a control against which higher doses are compared. This naturally leads to multiple comparisons. The ordered nature of doses suggests the use of stepwise procedures and the utilization of such ordering information to increase the efficiency of statistical procedures. Statistical inference under order restrictions has been a very active area of research   motivated by problems in areas such as medicine, toxicology, engineering and economics.  In this research proposal we will develop several simple and effective methods by utilizing different types of prior ordering information which arise naturally in dose-response and toxicity studies, and quantal  bioassay. 

This research will make some important and  novel  contributions regarding  constructing confidence intervals under order restrictions. This  research  will use recently proposed   partitioning  principle   to derive  powerful stepwise confidence interval procedures without multiplicity adjustment, whereas some previous applications of the closed testing approach  may result in incorrect decisions. The significance of the proposed research will be most useful in dose finding, toxicology and quantal bioassay. Drug regularity agencies such as Health Canada and Food and Drug Administration in U.S.A. can benefit greatly from this research. In addition, statistical and medical professionals may find this research helpful in understanding the practical concerns in selecting doses for a new drug.

"The objective of this research program is to investigate some important statistical issues related to survival data and to propose innovative statistical models and methods to analyze the data. Some of the issues relate to properly handling survival data with a possible surviving or cure fraction. We will propose new test procedures to detect the presence of the surviving fraction, new models to deal with possible correlation among survival times in clustered data, and new models and methods to deal with possible missing covariates. We will investigate the model identifiability and asymptotic properties of some recently proposed semiparametric cure models. We will also investigate new statistical approaches that improve the robustness or the efficiency of existing models and methods. We will consider similar issues for discrete data based on zero-inflated Poisson model. Other issues relate to measuring diagnostic and predictive power of time-dependent covariates/markers for survival data. We will propose new methods to evaluate diagnostic and predictive accuracy of time-dependent covariates/markers for survival data. We will consider new evaluation methods for survival data with a surviving fraction. We will also investigate new methods to locate markers/covariates that provide better guidelines in treatment selection in clinical trails with multiple treatments available. When finished, this program will contribute to survival analysis by providing novel statistical models and methods for analyzing survival data with possible correlated survival times or a possible surviving fraction. It will greatly expand the applicability of the survival models in health related studies, engineering, econometrics, and biology, where the types of the data investigated in this program are commonly found. It will also contribute to graduate students training, both Master's level and PhD level, and research fellows by providing various levels of research projects suitable for the training. High quality publications in the first rate biostatistical journals can be expected from this research program.

"The next decade will be crucial for our understanding of the fundamental structure of elementary particles and forces.  The advent of high-energy  colliders, the Large Hadron Collider  and the International Linear Collider, will give access to a completely new energy domain and may uncover principally new physical phenomena such as the extra space dimensions or  supersymmetry. On the other hand, the increasing accuracy of the low-energy experiments such as measurement  of the muon anomalous magnetic moment in Brookhaven National Laboratory or the muon decay spectrum in TRIUMF also makes them sensitive probes of ""new physics"" beyond the standard model of elementary particles. In most cases the new physics shows up at a tiny deviation from the theoretical predictions based on the standard model. Thus high precision of the predictions becomes mandatory. The main goal of this project is the high precision calculation  in a wide class of the quantum field theory problems which are of primary phenomenological importance for current and future experiments. The difficulty of the problem requires developing new theoretical and computational tools which are closely related to the fundamental concepts of the quantum field theory. Deeper understanding and development of these concepts are  among the goals of the project.

"While the best known trend in speech and language processing over the last twenty years is probably still its adoption of statistical methods to crack open a variety of previously intractable computing applications (speech recognition, machine translation, web-page search, etc.), this field has recently turn another, very different, less celebrated, but equally transformative corner.  State of the art research on many of these applications can now be spotted not so much by their radically new techniques, although innovations have of course still been forthcoming, as by their radically larger **scales**.  A great many machine translation groups still essentially use IBM's models from the early 1990s, but trained over half a petabyte (a megabyte of megabytes) of data.  The best text-to-speech synthesizers manipulate speech signals in about the same way as their predecessors did 15 years ago, in fact, but they paste together pieces of recorded speech from databases that are tens of thousands of times larger than they were back then.  Bigger now does actually go a very long way towards producing better. 

What this means for top-ranked research groups such as University of Toronto's Computational Linguistics Lab is that it is now difficult if not impossible to remain competitive merely by carefully selecting research topics for post-graduate students that will not pit them against some better equipped laboratory in a race that is entirely determined by the quantity of resources thrown at the problem.  Even genuinely cleverer, better ideas now need a comparable allocation of resources just to prove that they are better.  The research strengths and ongoing research activities of our faculty and students revolve around several topics that simply require a larger scale of computing power than we can provide.

"    )	The proposed research will involve the use of Nuclear Magnet Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy together with diffraction techniques and quantum chemical calculations to investigate the electronic, molecular and crystalline structures of molecular solids and the motions of molecules within these solids.

    )	Molecular and electronic structure ultimately determine the properties of many of the substances that surround us. We use NMR spectroscopy to probe electronic and molecular structure. The parameters that we measure by NMR spectroscopy are sensitive to structure and can be used to obtain information about the molecule. The advantage of solid state NMR spectroscopy is that it provides three dimensional information since the molecules are held in one position inside the crystal lattice, not tumbling rapidly as in the gas or liquid states.

    )	Our second goal is to study the motions of molecules and parts of molecules in the solid state. Aside from obtaining additional information about molecular structure, these studies will also provide information on how strongly the molecules in solids are held together.

"We propose to make measurements of muonium reaction rates in supercritical water to provide unique data necessary for the development of a supercritical-water-cooled nuclear reactor. Muonium (Mu) behaves as a light isotope of atomic hydrogen (H). TRIUMF, in Vancouver, B.C. is one of only four locations in the world with intense muon beams suitable for such work. We have already made measurements as high as 470°C, but for this new project it will be necessary to engineer new apparatus capable of higher temperatures, ideally up to 650°C. A common feature of our measurements to date is that muonium rate constants initially increase with temperature (the expected behaviour) but then go through a maximum. For one reaction (Mu + methanol) the rate constant was found to go through a minimum close to the critical point (374°C) and then rise again. It is our belief that the key factor is the solvent-driven dynamics, in particular the number of collisions per encounter of a pair of reactants. Recent work on H, OH and hydrated electrons by other authors shows similar behaviour, thus supporting our model. Therefore Mu reaction data can be used to simulate the behaviour of H and other radiolysis transients under such conditions, or at the very least provide data which can be used to model the behaviour of the solvent. It is relatively easy to carry out Mu kinetics experiments on samples under extreme conditions. This is because muon spin spectroscopy is sensitive only to the transient species under study and is unaffected by environmental effects. It is possible to produce a beam of muons with sufficient energy to penetrate a thick metal window of a pressure vessel, avoiding the problems associated with optical windows needed for competing methods. Muon spin spectroscopy operates on the microsecond timescale, so optimal Mu decay rates can be achieved with reactant concentrations of 0.01-100 mM for the fast rate constants expected. The choice of reactions to be studied will be made with the guidance of AECL scientists and will include key products of the radiolysis of water (hydrogen and oxygen) as well as studies as a function of pH and ionic strength.

"The Centre for Molecular and Materials Science (CMMS) at TRIUMF is a facility that serves a broad community of scientists who make use of the TRIUMF beams of muons and radioactive nuclides to investigate diverse areas of chemistry, physics and materials science. Specifically, CMMS provides equipment and support personnel to enable visiting researchers to make use of muon spin spectroscopy (muSR) or beta-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (beta-NMR and beta-NQR).  The beams provided by TRIUMF make CMMS unique in Canada. Indeed, there is no other high intensity muon source in the Americas, and only three others in the world (Japan, Switzerland and the U.K.). The muon and beta-emitting nuclides act as microscopic probes of internal magnetic fields in materials. Thus, muSR and beta-NMR are both used to study novel superconductors and magnetic materials.  Beta-NMR is particular useful for the study of thin films. In other systems a muon can bind to an electron to form a muonium atom, which is, chemically, an isotope of hydrogen; applications include the study of hydrogen atom kinetics, organic free radicals and hydrogen-doped semiconductors.  Since CMMS provides facilities at several beam lines, and Users typically visit TRIUMF for one or two weeks at a time, two or three times a year, there is frequent turnover of equipment and research personnel at the target stations. It is therefore necessary for the spectrometers and allied equipment to be held in common and managed by a core of permanent staff, who train and assist Users, ensure safe and efficient operation, and provide the continuity necessary for maintenance and development. The essential equipment and personnel comprise the core of the Centre for Molecular and Materials Science at TRIUMF. An increase in support personnel is needed to cope with the recent expansion of the beta-NMR facilities and the current installation of a new muon beam line.  In addition, a CFI-funded project will bring further muon facilities within three years.

"Bitumen upgrading technologies need to reduce costs and environmental impact. Reducing processing severity via new catalytic pathways may lower costs. Heavy molecules with high aromaticity, S, N and metals may be selectively adsorbed to reduce downstream intensive use of H2. 

A combined ""Thermal Cracking (Visbreaking)-Adsorption-Catalytic Steam Gasification"" upgrading process based on this idea has been recently studied and proposed by this research team. Under this scheme, a very low cost thermal processing such as visbreaking is envisaged followed by adsorption and steam gasification of near to instability asphaltene molecules. This processing would add little cost to upgrading allowing furthermore generating H2 from undesirable molecules in bitumen. 

Our preliminary investigations in the first phase have shown that the residue deprived of asphaltenes has a lower tendency to coke formation (low microcarbon residue) and can be further thermally cracked into liquid fuels. Now in the second phase, the project will undertake the development of materials showing high asphaltene adsorption, also evaluating the effect of modified surface properties on adsorption of near instability asphaltenes. It will also perform bench scale tests in a process configuration coupling visbreaking-adsorption-gasification. Thermal cracking of two feedstock extremes (Arabian Light vs. Athabasca) and then adsorption will be performed. The goal is to understand and generalize the use of this research for technological application. Development of improved catalysts via incorporation of more basic alkali-alkali earth metals within the solid matrix for the steam gasification of asphaltenes will be addressed. Information will be gathered on the selectivity to methane, light hydrocarbons and H2 during low temperature catalytic steam gasification (450-550 °C) of adsorbed asphaltene.

"Cost-effective access to renewable energy sources, and in particular solar energy, is of critical importance for maintaining global economic growth, while minimizing negative environmental impacts. The solar radiation that reaches our planet account for ca. 10,000 X the world's energy needs, but only 0.001% of our energy is made from this source. Photovoltaic (PV) devices can conveniently convert energy of solar photon flux into electricity. PV devices based on crystalline silicon (Si) and some other inorganic semiconductors offer excellent power conversion efficiency and unsurpassed stability; however, they are very expensive, particularly for large area/high capacity applications. Organic PV devices, based on polymer semiconductors, can be less expensive; however, they show much lower efficiency and, more importantly, very limited stability. In this proposal we suggest ways to engineer a hybrid device in which low-cost plastic solar waveguide concentrators collects the radiation from a large area and transmit the light to a high efficiency but small area PV device (such as crystalline Si-PV). The device operation is based on how a fluorescent dye absorbs an incoming photon (regardless of the incident angle) and preferentially re-emits it into the waveguide modes, which deliver it to a PV cell at the edge of the plastic film. Although the idea has been postulated a few decades ago, only in the last year has the feasibility of such concentrators (on solid glass supports) been demonstrated. This project will bring together the expertise in dye chemistry and photophysics, photonic waveguides and plastic optoelectronics to demonstrate an efficient and inexpensive solar concentrator based on

laminated plastic films. The stability of the (organic) fluorescent dyes will be improved through structural modification and encapsulation into plastic films. Even though photodegradation is unlikely to be completely eliminated, the low cost of such concentrators will allow to use them as replaceable parts of a PV device.","Alternative energy resources","McGill University",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Science et technologie des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"
"Electronic organic materials have all indications of becoming the materials of choice for a number of high-tech applications, including displays, solar cells, memories, sensors, etc. Therefore, our ability to understand and to design the electronic function is of paramount importance for development of future energy, communications and even medical and security technologies. Most of these special electronic properties are enabled highly delocalized pi-electron system in certain classes of organic molecules (pi-functional materials). Our research program is set to develop new approaches to synthesis and self-assembly of the new pi-functional materials, in order to control the electronic properties, both at the molecular and supramolecular level (i.e. in bulk solids). Performing the studies at three different levels - single molecules, molecular films and conjugated polymers, we look for a generalized understanding of how electronic conjugation and intermolecular interactions control the transport of electrical charge through the molecules, and how to apply these properties to build functional organic/molecular devices. The research program is structured such as to involve the synthesis and studies of materials applicable in current technologies (molecular semiconductors and conjugated polymers for thin film transistors) as well as those developing new concepts with potential applications in more distant future (eg, funcitonal molecular devices with multitermini electrical input/output). Since facile photo- and air-promoted degradation of organics is one of the major factors limiting their wide application in optoelectronics, we will pay a particular attention to stability of our materials; some of semiconducting molecules that we synthesize are stable in air up to almost 400oC. We expect that performing the suggested research will significantly impact our knowledge at the interface of organic chemistry, solid state physics and electronics, and yield the materials of practical importance for the optoelectronic technologies.","Advancement of knowledge","McGill University",2,"RGPAS ","Discovery Grants Program - Accelerator Supplements","Chimie organique","Chimie organique"

"Both music and speech give humans the power to make sense of sound. This remarkable human feature is currently the topic of a heated debate between scientists who emphasize the similarities between language and music, and others, like me, who have been argued that there is little cognitive overlap between these two major auditory-vocal faculties. Elucidating the origins of this divergence is very important from both an evolutionary and a neurobiological perspective. Thus, the goal of this research program is to document experimentally how music and speech differ and to what extent they interact.

To this aim, in the next grant period, I will focus mostly on auditory-vocal behavior. The novel focus of my research on this type of behavior, such as in vocal imitation, is motivated by the fact that singing is universal and is (perhaps) as natural as speaking. For example, singing in unison (i.e. along with someone else) improves speech recovery in brain-damaged patients whereas speaking along does not. Similarly, singing in unison improves pitch accuracy in amusic (tone-deaf) individuals as compared to singing alone, whereas it does not seem to help normal individuals, including children. Thus, the study of auditory-vocal coupling represents a very rich new area for understanding music cognition as it relates to language because it seems guided by largely unconscious processes, it is a natural alliance between music and speech, and it is more natural than most experimental perceptual tasks. The methods I will be exploiting in the next grant proposal comprise the detailed study of domain-specific disorders, as seen in congenital amusia (tone-deafness) and aphasia. In addition, I will exploit a novel technique --Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation--in order to study how temporary interference with auditory-vocal behavior can mimic the amusic and aphasic syndrome in normal brains.  

By combining these neuropsychological methods, this project should provide both theoretical and clinical insight on perception-action interactions. The putative domain-specificity of this highly sophisticated ability represents a unique opportunity to understand the neurobiological origins of music relative to speech.

"The demand for wireless communications is growing, requiring intelligent and economical use of wireless resources (spectrum, infrastructure, etc.). To improve system capacity, research has been focused towards two new areas: multi-hop communications and cognitive radios. This project's objective is to address the resource management and medium access control functions for the combination of multi-hop networks and cognitive radios to deliver the next-generation of high-capacity wireless technology.



This project addresses the resource management (channel/power/air_interface selection and scheduling) problem pertaining to multiple wireless hops between source and destination and the dynamic choice of one of multiple air interfaces (WWAN, WLAN, PAN) per hop enabled by cognitive radios. The project will focus on maximizing coverage and capacity in such a wireless environment by using resource management algorithms that exploit the cognitive knowledge (interference conditions, spectrum and air interface usage) in the networks, when available. A complementary part of this project addresses Medium Access Control (MAC)in multi-air-interface cognitive radio networks with multi hop communications. Typically, MAC is specific to the air interface. In a cognitive radio system, the optimal design of the most efficient means of delivering medium access control across diverse physical layers by exploiting the available cognitive knowledge is another area which has not received much attention, particularly from the perspective of supporting multi-hop communications. It is the intent of this research to progress this area to enable the cognitive intelligence to be exploited across all layers of the radio interface in a multi-air-interface, multi-hop system. The above research will be conducted with a combination of analytical tools and simulation tools. The outcomes of the project will provide an evolutionary vision for next generation standards in the area of multi-hop cognitive radio networks.

"My research is targeted towards computational problems that arise in the study of complex, dynamic biological networks.  Much of my research is motivated by ""high-content"" technologies, such as in vivo expression imaging or flow cytometry, in which the activities of a relatively small number of types of molecules are measured quantitatively with high spatial and/or temporal resolution in single cells or in tissues.   My research focuses on three areas: (1) model formulation and fitting, particularly for spatial/temporal gene expression data, (2) experiment design, especially for time-series experiments and drug screening problems, and (3) theoretical analysis of the information processing capabilities of biomolecular systems.  In the first two foci, I develop techniques that allow us to maximize the amount of information obtained from molecular biological data, and the efficiency with which that information is extracted.  In the final focus, the goal is to understand how biomolecular systems themselves make decisions, or how they can be engineered (via ""synthetic biology"") to carry out computational tasks.

"Engineered porous materials are finding increasingly diverse applications in electronics and photonics technologies. Self-assembled colloidal crystal films offer great potential as simple, inexpensive materials exhibiting a variety of unique optical and physical properties.  It is therefore of much scientific and technological interest to optimize these properties through the elimination, or at least the minimization, of the various intrinsically-formed defects revealed in our previous studies. Fortunately, the forms of defect having the most adverse effects on the optical properties of colloidal photonic crystals are the ones most readily addressed.  These are: i) cracks and ii) impurity spheres, which give rise to partial dislocations and stacking faults. Strategies to eliminate or minimize the occurrence of these defects will be developed in this study.



Films with crystalline mesoporosity, exemplified but not limited by periodic mesoporous silicas (PMS) and periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMO) are of great interest in the semiconductor industry because of their unique properties associated with their porous structures, such as their low dielectric constant. They are usually made by surfactant and block copolymer template-directed self-assembly of silica and organosilica precursors. Our previous work has demonstrated that Periodic Mesoporous Organosilicas (PMO), which contain organic species uniformly distributed inside inorganic mesopore walls, can be synthesized with dielectric constants (k) as low as 1.8, an ideal property for low-k dielectric materials required for future nanoelectronic devices. The next challenge for applying these films in industry is to enhance their mechanical strength so that they can survive the chemical mechanical polishing process during device manufacturing. The objective of the research project is therefore to boost the mechanical strength of PMO thin film through synthetic design.","Materials sciences","University of Toronto",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Science et technologie des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"

"Le r�seau routier canadien, et plus particuli�rement celui du Qu�bec, est dans un �tat de d�t�rioration avanc�e et exige des efforts de r�habilitation majeurs. Au Qu�bec, les autorit�s �valuent � plus de 10 milliards de dollars l'investissement requis pour la prochaine d�cennie pour remettre en �tat les art�res principales de son r�seau.  



L'apparition pr�matur�e de fissures de fatigue sur les chauss�es du Qu�bec en p�riodes de gel et de d�gel t�moigne d'un �cart important entre les conditions r�elles et les mod�les d'endommagement des mat�riaux et de conception de chauss�es. Cet endommagement pr�matur� semble directement reli� aux conditions s�v�res qui pr�valent en fin d'hiver (pr�sence d'eau, de sels de d�gla�age et de temp�rature oscillant autour de 0 �C). En modifiant le type de structure, notamment en augmentant l'�paisseur des mat�riaux li�s, on peut esp�rer r�duire le risque de fissuration pr�matur� en p�riode de d�gel.



La r�habilitation d'une partie de la structure d'une chauss�e par le retraitement de certaines de ces couches permet, d'une part, de recycler des enrob�s bitumineux et, d'autre part, d'augmenter l'�paisseur de ses couches bitumineuses. Or, le rendement en fatigue des mat�riaux de chauss�e incorporant des granulats bitumineux concass�s (GBC), recycl�s (GBR), lesquels sont soumis � des conditions climatiques s�v�res au Canada, est mal connu. Le programme de recherche porte sur l'�tude de la fatigue aux basses temp�ratures (de -20 �C � 10 �C) de ces mat�riaux en consid�rant l'effet des cycles de gel-d�gel en condition satur�e. Les r�sultats permettront le raffinement des m�thodes actuelles de dimensionnement des chauss�es et ce, afin qu'elles soient adapt�es aux conditions climatiques du Qu�bec et des pays nordiques.

RESUME DE LA PROPOSITION AUX FINS DE DIFFUSION PUBLIQUE (en langage courant).

Ce r�sum� en langage courant sera mis � la disposition du public si votre proposition est financ�e. M�me si ce n'est pas obligatoire, vous pouvez choisir de fournir votre num�ro de t�l�phone au travail et votre adresse de courriel afin que le public et les m�dias puissent communiquer facilement avec vous au sujet de vos travaux de recherche.

Dans le domaine des infrastructures routi�res, le d�veloppement durable passe par l'implantation d'une m�thode analytique pour la conception des chauss�es souples. Actuellement, l'industrie canadienne est pi�g�e par la rigidit� de la m�thode de conception empirique, ne prenant pas en compte le comportement thermom�canique des mat�riaux bitumineux. La m�thode empirique de conception des chauss�es souples actuellement utilis�e au Canada limite litt�ralement l'int�gration de nouveaux mat�riaux et de nouveaux proc�d�s autant pour la conception de chauss�es neuves que pour la r�habilitation.

La th�matique de recherche propos�e dans le cadre de ce projet de RDC vise l'int�gration des propri�t�s thermom�caniques des mat�riaux bitumineux, telles que la r�sistance � la fatigue et le module complexe, dans la conception d'une chauss�e souple. Pour ce faire, il faut orienter le processus de conception vers une approche en partie analytique (m�canistique) plut�t qu'empirique. Bien que des m�thodes de conception de type m�canistique-empirique soient couramment utilis�es dans plusieurs pays et ce, depuis plusieurs d�cennies, leur application directe au Canada est probl�matique pour deux raisons: 1) les mat�riaux que l'on utilise sont diff�rents notamment en ce qui a trait aux liants hydrocarbon�s qui interf�rent sur la performance structurale en fatigue de la chauss�e et, 2) les param�tres de calage laboratoire-chantier d�pendent de l'environnement et des conditions de trafic, sp�cifiques � un pays donn�. Le virage vers une approche de conception m�canistique-empirique n�cessite donc une recherche fondamentale sur la performance en fatigue des mat�riaux bitumineux coupl�e � une validation sur route pour cerner les param�tres de calage.

Le projet comporte 3 p�les : (a) �laborer un mod�le de fatigue des mat�riaux bitumineux, (b) quantifier in-situ les param�tres de calage pour la transposition �du laboratoire � la route� et, (c) int�grer les concepts se rapportant � une approche m�canistique de conception.

"Viroids are small, single-stranded, circular RNAs that replicate through a DNA-independent rolling circle mechanism. When they infect higher plants, they cause diseases that result in significant losses in the agricultural industry. These RNA species possess both genotypic and phenotypic (e.g. catalytic RNA) properties. They have consequently been described as model ""relics"" of a pre-cellular RNA world. In essence, viroids constitute a minimal biological system ideal for detailed RNA structure/function analyses. Since our last funding, we have made significant progress in the characterization of the peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd) as a model RNA species, with advances in finding new variants, studying its structure, elucidating its replication mechanism, and showing how it switches ""on"" posttranscriptional gene silencing. Our current goal remains to fully comprehend the PLMVd life cycle. Inherent to this goal, our specific objectives are:



1.    )	To describe the initiation mechanism of PLMVd replication and to subsequently develop a single-tube, rolling-circle assay with which to address both evolutionary and biochemical questions; 

2.    )	To investigate the hypothesis that PLMVd affects gene expression through miRNA species; and,

3.    )	To both identify any host proteins that bind PLMVd and characterize the nature of these interactions.



Clearly, this is an ambitious multifaceted project, and its completion goes beyond the period funded by this grant. We expect to elucidate the intimate details of PLMVd knowledge, which is essential for the development of an efficient method of controlling its disastrous effects on the agricultural industry. The identification of the proteins interacting with PLMVd and the monitoring of miRNA and mRNA along the PLMVd infection pathway will permit us to look at the viroid from a new angle. Overall, this research will provide new insights into the replication and pathogenesis of infectious RNAs.

"Stress is a part of life and responding appropriately to stressors is necessary for survival. There is a lot of individual variability in stress responding and also in the incidence of stress-related diseases, such as mood disorders. The main goal of my research is to investigate the role that specific sources of variability play so that we can better understand what makes some people susceptible to stress-related dysfunction, while others appear resilient. One source of variability that we investigate is sex. There are sex differences in the effects of stress and in the incidence/presentation of stress-related diseases. Over the years, we have made important contributions to this field and will continue investigating how and why males and females differ in stress responding. More recently, we have been examining the role that higher order brain regions play in individual variability in stress responding. Such brain regions are involved in perceiving if a particular situation is stressful and play a large part in telling 'lower' brain regions to begin the process of releasing stress hormones that act on various parts of the body. One of these brain regions continues to develop throughout adolescence and we have shown that stress exposure during adolescence has long-term effects on adult stress responding. In the current set of experiments, we will investigate whether adolescent stress affects this brain region and if that is associated with the long-term effects on stress responding.","Medical and health sciences","Dalhousie University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Neurologie du comportement",Psychologie

"The evolution of continents, their stability, as well as their elevation are determined by two main sources: the thermochemical and mechanical structure of the Earth's mantle and crust, and the interaction of lithospheric tectonics with surface processes. The present research program will focus on two broad aspects of geophysics: lithosphere-climate interactions and lithosphere-mantle interactions. Geomorphological advances in recent years have suggested that these two types of interactions are related, calling for the development of new physical models to describe the dynamic evolution of the the Earth's surface. 

    The first part of the programme will focus on the thermochemical and density structure of the lithospheric mantle in both stable cratonic and tectonically active regions. Constraints on these parameters may be obtained through heat flow, xenolith, seismic tomography as well as various geophysical datasets. The heat flow dataset is the only direct method of determing the thermal structure of continents, and therefore ongoing heat flow measurements will be part of this research programme. These measurements will be combined with other geophysical datasets to obtain constraints on the density structure, and velocity-density and velocity-temperature scalings essential to the interpretation of seismic tomographic images.

    In the last two decades, geomorphology has contributed to this area of study through investigations of how erosion of topography by surface processes can alter the rate and form of orogen evolution. Tectonics influences local and regional climate by raising mountains and plateaus, leading to enhanced rainfall. As erosion of mountains and tectonic structure occurs, mass is redistributed, altering the gravitational stresses and producing internal lithospheric deformation. The mantle responds dynamically by uplift, and the increased elevation locally alters climate patterns. The response of the lithosphere to tectonic processes depends on temperature, and self-consistent mechano-thermal lithospheric models which fit the observed geophysical constraints such as heat flow and topography must be developed to study tectonic and climatic interactions.

The requested equipment will support the on-going research programs of three researchers (SF Perry, KM Gilmour and PJ Walsh) to facilitate their studies on the physiology of fishes.  Owing to the demise of equipment, this group of researchers has lost the capacity to measure CO2 concentration in water samples, a measurement which is central to their research on CO2 excretion in goldfish at extreme temperatures (Perry), the ontogeny of CO2 excretion in embryonic and larval zebrafish (Gilmour) and interactions between ammonia and CO2 excretion in fish (Walsh).","Advancement of knowledge","University of Ottawa",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","Physiologie et m�tabolisme des animaux","Biologie animale"
"1.    )	Much of my research examines how fish are able to adapt to changing environmental conditions and acute or chronic stressors.  A large component of this application will address the involvement of an important hormonal response to stress, the adrenergic stress response.  This response, aimed at optimising physiological function and minimising the detrimental effects of stress, is initiated by the release of two hormones into the bloodstream. These hormones, adrenaline and noradrenaline, are termed the catecholamine hormones.  Specific research that is proposed in this grant application would attempt to elucidate the complex mechanisms triggering the release of catecholamines, a process that is presently not well understood in fish.  This research is particularly relevant as fish continue to encounter deteriorating and stressful environmental conditions.

2.    )	A second component of my overall research program investigates the nature of salt movement across the fish gill and its linkage to internal pH regulation.  These processes, termed ionic and acid-base regulation, have been investigated intensely by Canadian scientists in recent years. My lab is now using powerful molecular techniques to confirm and expand upon a new model for ionic and acid-base regulation. My lab has cloned and will continue to clone several of the genes that are thought to play a role in ionic and acid-base regulation.  This enables localisation and thorough characterisation of the specific molecules that transport salt, acids and bases across the gill.

3. A third aspect of my research addresses the causes and consequences of the cardiorespiratory adjustments of fish to ambient carbon dioxide.  Proposed research will focus on identifying the sites of CO2 chemoreception in fish and uncovering the mechanisms underlying CO2 sensitivity.

"Modern road engineering practice requires explicit consideration of the safety consequences of decisions in designing a new facility or improving an existing one.  This is a fundamental principle in the Transportation Association of Canada's Geometric Design Guide, which is regarded around the world as ground-breaking in this respect. Unfortunately, reliable explicit knowledge on safety implications is relatively scarce and the full potential of this Guide is unrealized. The fundamental objective of the proposed research is to make advances in the methodology for deriving crash modification factors or functions that are used to quantify the safety implications of road design decisions. Extensive use will be made of data from the Highway Safety Information System, and from the Ontario provincial and the city of Toronto crash and roadway databases. The proposed research will make a significant contribution in the fulfillment of ""Road Safety Vision 2010"", as set forth by the Canadian Council of Ministers for Transportation and Highway Safety, to reduce the average number of road users killed or seriously injured in Canada by 30% by the 2008-2010 period (compared to 1996-2001). To this end, there will be appropriate focus on the roadway elements and interventions most relevant to the targets of this vision. The research is particularly timely in the light of a major U.S.-led initiative to develop a first edition of a Highway Safety Manual (HSM) by 2008, and especially in the light of the reality that there will be surprisingly little information in the HSM on reliable crash modification factors or functions.

"This research program aims to develop new algorithms for improved computerized methods to solve complex

planning problems that occur in a number of areas of human activity, with important economic and social

impacts. Examples of such problems are employee scheduling, sports scheduling, telecommunications design,

and transportation logistics. The concrete combinatorial problems encountered in these areas are reputedly very

difficult to solve in a satisfactory manner.

Constraint Programming is a powerful technique to solve combinatorial problems. It applies sophisticated

inference to reduce the search space but, to date, lacks a generic and robust search heuristic. This

puts the latter technology at a disadvantage in terms of ease of use even though its modeling flexibility is an

asset to address realistic industrial problems.

Global constraints have played a central role in Constraint Programming because they capture key

substructures of a problem and efficiently exploit them to boost inference. This research project proposes doing

the same thing for search. Whereas most generic dynamic search heuristics in constraint programming rely on

information at the fine-grained level of individual variables, we investigate dynamic

search heuristics based on coarser, but more global, information. The search heuristics proposed revolve

around the knowledge of the number of solutions for individual constraints, the intuition being that a constraint

with few solutions corresponds to a critical part of the problem with respect to satisfiability.

"With the recent advances in ultrafast spectroscopy, which now permit the observation of chemical reactions in real time, there is an ever increasing interest in theoretical studies of chemical reaction dynamics, as they can predict, explain and guide experiments. In particular, molecular dynamics techniques allow the motions of atoms and molecules to be simulated at the microscopic level, providing invaluable information about the mechanism and kinetics of chemical reactions. Dynamical studies are essential since they provide a link between potential energy surfaces calculated by electronic structure theory (quantum chemistry) and experimental measurements of chemical dynamics. In many instances, experimental observables are too convoluted to explain and understand without the help of theory. Furthermore, connection with experiment is crucial for assessing the reliability of computer simulations and theoretical models, which, in turn can be used to improve our fundamental understanding of chemistry.

New directions are proposed for the development of tools aimed at realistic computer simulations, which include an improved description of molecular interactions and the inclusion of quantum nuclear effects and possible nonadiabatic effects in dynamical simulations. Most applications will focus on clusters, which are aggregates of atoms or molecules which bridge the gap between the gas and condensed (liquid) phases. Clusters can be used as tools for selective microsolvation, or they can be a distinct class of materials with unique properties. We will study, in particular, 1) the fragmentation and reactions of cluster materials, 2) cluster and bulk microsolvation, 3) cluster photochemical processes and 4) probing molecular interactions and monitoring molecular dynamics with spectroscopy, in clusters, solution and complex environments. Our theoretical studies will help explain and guide experimental studies, and will contribute to a deeper molecular-level understanding of chemistry, with diverse potential applications from nanotechnology (e.g. hydrogen/energy storage) to biology (e.g. protein denaturation).

"We will apply theory of infinite-dimensional groups, especially their geometric, dynamical, and combinatorial aspects, to studying some old open problems, including Connes' Embedding Conjecture and Gottschalk's Surjunctivity Conjecture. 



We will be doing this by means of considering intermediate classes of discrete groups, introduced only recently but already causing a significant interest. These groups are obtained as subgroups of some concrete infinite-dimensional groups equipped with rich and interesting additional structures but receiving little attention up until now. They include hyperlinear groups, which are linked to the famous Connes' Embedding Conjecture, and where every advance will have important consequences for a number of areas, such as operator algebras and free probability. The corresponding infinite-dimensional group that we will be studying in this connection is the ultraproduct of the unitary groups of finite rank with the normalised Hilbert-Schmidt distance. Another important class is that of sofic groups, introduced by Gromov as means to approach Gottschalk's surjunctivity conjecture in symbolic dynamics. Sofic groups are subgroups of the ultraproduct of finite symmetric groups with regard to the normalized Hamming metric. We will study the relationships between these and other closely related classes of groups, including groups with Haagerup property, initially subamenable groups, groups amenable at infinity, and others. Our approach based on infinite-dimensional groups proposes a new viewpoint of the old problems.

"We study critical phenomena in statistical mechanics. The models (percolation, random-cluster models, random walks) are central objects of modern probability, and are widely applied to the study of physical, biological and social phenomena. One striking feature is the emergence of symmetries in the continuum limits of these discrete random systems, like conformal invariance in two dimensions. (A classical example is Brownian Motion, the limit of random walk.) These are key examples of conformal field theory, and recent mathematical developments have provided not just rigorous proofs, but also greatly improved on the theoretical physics understanding.



One of our goals is to understand the sensitivity of these models to small noise (a phenomenon that limits prediction and computation), and the emergence of exceptional events in the time evolution of these systems. A related goal is to prove conformal invariance or non-invariance for some of these two-dimensional models. We will also study these models beyond the Euclidean (planar or higher-dimensional) setting: on infinite groups as underlying spaces. This area is characterized by a rich interplay between geometric, probabilistic and algebraic properties, hence it is of great interest to several mathematical communities.



An independent direction is the dichotomy between structure and randomness, appearing in many different contexts: graph theory, dynamical systems, number theory, to name some mathematical ones. A general principle is that large structures can be decomposed into a quasi-random and a quasi-periodic part, and by studying these two extreme cases by different methods, one hopes to understand the original arbitrary structure. This decomposition is harder for sparse structures: our main goal is to advance that area. We will also relate different approaches to quasi-periodicity in the context of quasicrystals, models of curious physical materials.

"This proposal addresses challenges that Canada is facing presently and will face for the next few decades. As seen recently on the international scene, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases propagated by bacteria might threaten populations' health. To address these issues, Canada will need advanced biomedical technologies for early detection of infectious diseases in humans and animals. Detection of pathogenic bacteria is very important in various sectors like medical diagnosis, nosocomial infections, food safety, and biological war. In order to establish a prevention plan, or an effective intervention plan in the event of bacterial contamination, it is necessary to carry out a significant, specific and fast detection. Current tests require days and even weeks to confirm a diagnosis of the presence of a pathogen and other infectious diseases in a patient. The development of affordable diagnostic technologies, such as Point-of-Care Testing (POTC) devices, in the form of hand-held devices will provide for more timely and accurate test results. POTC is extremely interesting since it can be performed at the site of the patient care, such as in emergency rooms, battlefields, outpatient clinics, nursing homes, patients' homes or hospital bedside, with the result leading to possible change in the care of the patient.



This project aims to develop bio- and microtechnologies that target extremely short diagnosis time combined with exceptional limit of detection. To this purpose we develop novel ultra-sensitive lab-on-chip bacterial sensors based on functionalized optical microcavities by phages. The sensitivity is reached through a thermo-optical effect that produces a shift in the optical resonance of the cavity. Since the cavity has an extremely high quality factor, the detection is therefore highly sensitive. In addition the detection does not require prior labeling of the analyte, reducing significantly the analysis time.

"Estimates of abundance and productivity for Pacific salmon populations often have wide confidence limits and are subject to bias. This situation can lead to misclassification of a population's level of endangerment based on conservation criteria. Such misclassifications may increase biological conservation risks or unnecessarily decrease social and economic benefits of fishing or other uses of aquatic systems. However, budgets for monitoring are limited. We therefore propose to use empirically based computer simulations to identify reliable, cost-effective monitoring and assessment methods for salmon. Such methods will consist of various data collection schemes, spatial and temporal patterns of sampling, and techniques for analyzing the resulting data. We will identify methods that can estimate salmon abundance and productivity, as well as their conservation status, with low bias and high precision. Those methods will reduce the chance of misclassifying the status of salmon populations and thereby increase the chance of maintaining them in a productive state. 

    )	In keeping with the emerging concept of ""evidence-based conservation"", we will also evaluate the merits of different experimental designs of salmon monitoring programs to find those that reduce the influence of confounding factors (e.g., simultaneous environmental or human-induced changes). Such designs will narrow the range of plausible hypotheses about causes of past changes in abundance and will more reliably evaluate the effectiveness of recovery actions. This research will thus help determine which monitoring methods and experimental designs are both feasible and most effective at achieving conservation and recovery goals.

"My research focuses on child memory, especially children's eyewitness memory for stressful events and their ability to recall events from their very early life, i.e., infantile amnesia. With children often testifying in court, the nature of early child memory is an important issue, and the proposed research will not only advance knowledge in my field but be useful for those working with children in forensic capacities (e.g., courts, police, & lawyers). For several years I have taken advantage of naturally-occurring stressful experiences, namely injuries serious enough to require hospital ER treatment, to investigate eye-witness memory about stressful events in children. Recently I have also begun studying children's earliest memories. Proposed research in eyewitness memory: Researchers have consistently found considerable individual variation in children's memory for injury and the proposed research will explored some potential factors that contribute to explanations of such variation, such as emotional, language, and cognitive factors. Also, how children are interviewed has remained a key issue; I plan to explore different methods that focus on encouraging young children to provide more elaborative information in open-ended recall. Such research will improve techniques in the method of questioning children used by law enforcement officers. Proposed research in infantile amnesia: Although there has been considerable research on infantile amnesia in adults, this phenomenon in children has mostly been ignored. Little research has explored children's memory for their early years, and individual differences are rife. What factors influence this variation? I intend to explore a number of them, including age, gender, culture, social, and cognitive factors. The fact that preschool-aged children can recall and talk about experiences but lose access to these memories as they get older is a mystery that engenders considerable public interest (and forensic debate  - especially because of accounts of recovered memories of infancy).

"Metal-bearing sulfate minerals often have a significant impact on water quality near mining centers. They form through the oxidation and hydration of sulfur-containing ores. This process is accelerated dramatically when mining activity creates fine-grained sulfide-containing waste that can interact with oxygen and water. Mine waste from processing these sulfide ores creates very complex geochemical problems as the minerals interact with the atmosphere on the surface at a mine site and pollute the ground water. These problems can only be understood if there is detailed mineralogical information for the many sulfate minerals which come and go as the waste alters through the freeze/thaw cycle of the Canadian climate and over time as the waste matures. It is not enough to study well crystallized minerals from museum collections as these do not often have the same properties as materials that have formed under conditions found at active mine waste sites. To understand the mineralogical relationships a combination of field and laboratory studies are required. The field studies identify the particular mineralogical interactions which are important in mine waste settings. Laboratory experiments model these existing interactions in controlled settings so individual effects and processes can be isolated. These are not rare minerals from a restricted locality but are widespread in a variety of natural and disturbed environments. They are difficult to study because of their fine grain size and the intimate mixing of several species in one sample. The ability to design successful mine waste containment systems requires a thorough understanding of the minerals that are present. There is a tremendous opportunity for students to be trained in the various field and laboratory techniques during these studies.

  The surface of Mars is thought to have had acidic metal containing solutions present in the past and the processes that we study in acidic mine waste are relevant on Mars. Recently, we predicted the existence of a new sulfate mineral on Earth based on the rover data and found it on a frozen lake in British Columbia. We plan to continue this work and interact with the scientists planning the next missions to Mars.

"This proposal is for the purchase of a time-resolved particle image velocimetry (TRPIV) system.  TRPIV is a velocity measurement technique for fluid mechanics that provides the velocity field within a defined measurement plane with adequate temporal resolution.  The system consists of three primary components: (i) a high frame rate CMOS camera, (ii) a high repetition rate pulsed laser to provide illumination and define the measurement plane, and (iii) a data acquisition computer used to control and synchronize the camera and laser, acquire the camera images, and process the images to obtain the velocity field.  The proposed system will be the keystone of a new unsteady and biological fluid mechanics laboratory being established at the University of Waterloo (UW) by Dr. Peterson.  The inherently unsteady nature of biological fluid flows, such as the pulsatile blood flow produced by the heart, necessitates a measurement system capable of acquiring not only high spatial resolution full field data, but the temporal flow development.  For example, it is well established that both spatial and temporal gradients of the wall shear stress have been implicated in cardiovascular disease initiation and progression.  Specifically, the requested equipment will be used in the research program proposed in Dr. Peterson's concurrent Discovery Grant application, which focuses on the impact between coherent fluid structures (such as vortices produced in a pumping heart) and a deformable smart material strip towards energy harvesting to power micro-electronic devices and sensors.  The fluid/structure interaction is inherently unsteady and spatially variant, thus requiring full-field measurement system with sufficient temporal resolution.  The requested TRPIV system is vital for the establishment of a fully functional fluid mechanics research program at the forefront of experimental fluid science.

"One of the major tenets of research in learning and memory is that learning involves the repetitive activation of neurons which induces alterations in the number or structure of synapses. Research has indicated that a number of features of the synaptic junction are capable of change, including synaptic number, the size of the active zone,synaptic curvature and the presence of synaptic perforations. Over the last granting period, in collaboration with Dr. Richard Thompson,we examined the synaptic changes one hour following eye-blink conditioning in the rabbit cerebellum. We also examined the synaptic structural changes in newly formed adult synapses over time, as they are used. We will now conduct a time-course study, examining the synaptic structural changes that occur over time following eye-blink conditioning in Dr. Thompson's animals. Using animals prepared by Dr. Alcino Silva, we  will examined the synaptic changes associated with the H-ras mutant mouse, which shows enhanced LTP and learning. Conversely, we also examined cellular changes in the NF1 mutant mouse, which shows a deficit in cognition. In collaboration with Dr. Ted Berger (Univ. Southern California) we also began preliminary investigations comparing the electrophysiological recordings made in our LTP studies with those predicted by Dr. Berger's mathematical model of synaptic structure and function. We will continue this collaboration, comparing the predicted and observed electrophysiological changes based on our actual observed changes in synaptic structure. These studies will allow us to continue our examination of the synaptic basis of learning, and help us understand many of the mechanisms underlying these synaptic changes.

"My research in the recent past has concentrated in three general areas: 

1. Statistical design and analysis methodology for clinical trials.  

2. Environmental epidemiological studies of the effects of air pollution on human health, where the primary focus is on subject-area issues but open methodological issues relating to the most appropriate designs and most effective methods of statistical analysis for such studies naturally arise.  

3. Development of sequential designs for clinical experiments within a decision-theoretic framework, where the aim is to determine optimal designs and investigate the performance of competing designs.  



My activity over the current funding period evolved to become concentrated in the first area and I expect this to continue during the next funding period.  This research is motivated by my collaboration with the MS/MRI Research Group at UBC and my involvement with organizations such as the U.S. National MS Society that are concerned with improving how clinical trials in MS are carried out and analyzed.  The focus of the research is to develop suitable stochastic models for the types of longitudinal data collected in clinical trials in MS, to determine effective designs for clinical trials in MS and to determine efficient methods of analyzing the types of data collected in clinical trials in MS.  (These stochastic models, experimental designs and methods of statistical analysis are also relevant in many other areas, but my primary involvement is in MS.)  This research involves investigating the suitability of available statistical methodology for the MS context and developing new statistical methodology to address problems arising the the MS context.  The overall objective is to enhance the amount of information obtained from clinical trials in MS, through the development of more effective designs and more comprehensive approaches to the analysis of the data collected.","Mathematical sciences","University of British Columbia",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Statistique appliqu�e","Statistique et probabilit�"

"Positioning capability is becoming commonplace in today's society with certain automobiles, mobile telephones and even clothing being equipped with navigation systems.  Most systems rely, at least in part, on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology such as the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS).  Using optimal data processing strategies, positioning accuracies can be as good as 2-3 cm.  Unfortunately, the GPS signals that reach the Earth have very low power, which have historically limited their use to ""open-sky"" areas where the satellite signals can be received without being attenuated by such things as foliage and buildings.  However, GPS receiver manufacturers have, in the past ten years, developed high-sensitivity receivers that can track signals in degraded environments such as indoors where the signal is attenuated by a factor of about 1,000.  Despite this extended operational range, high-sensitivity receivers typically suffer from positioning accuracies no better than several metres.  



This work therefore aims to investigate new and innovative means of using GNSS and other complementary systems to improve positioning performance in degraded environments.  New GNSS receiver implementations will be developed and tested in software and used with GNSS signals soon to be deployed by Russia and Europe.  Integration of GNSS with data from inertial sensors, ultra wideband radios and WiFi will be used to further improve accuracy and reliability.  Focus will be on cm-level positioning.



This work will be directly applicable to GNSS receiver manufacturers as well as companies that develop services based on location (e.g., cell phone service providers).  Furthermore, improved positioning capability will enable Canadian companies to excel in the rapidly growing GNSS marketplace, and will enable or improve a wide range of applications including safety-of-life applications.","Communications technologies (satellites, radar, etc.)","University of Calgary",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�omatique, syst�mes de positionnement global","Information g�ographique"

"Interconnects for solid oxide fuel cells are made of high chromium alloy to achieve adequate corrosion resistance at 800 C and and are coated on the cathode side by strontium-doped lanthanum manganite perovskite (LSM) as a barrier against chromium evaporation. A significant problem that remains is the very high cost associated with the air plasma spray (APS) coating process. The contributing cost factors are: i) the high price of the raw material (around $100/kg), ii) the low deposition efficiency (typically 30%-40% utilization), iii) the high capital equipment cost and iv) the relatively low output of the APS process. The proposed research will identify alternative coating methods which improve material yield and reduce equipment capital requirements. In addition, it will demonstrate that spinel is a lower cost alternative to the LSM material. The demonstrated functionality of the APS/LSM system will be used as a metric to gauge the acceptability of the new materials

and coating methods.","Energy storage and conversion","McMaster University",1,"EGP   ","Engage Grants Program                                                                               ","C�ramiques","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"
"Refining of Solar Grade Silicon 



        There is a growing demand for solar grade silicon, which falls into an intermediate range of price and specification between metallurgical grade and electronic grade silicon. 6N Silicon Inc., a new Canadian company, has developed a technology for the refining of silicon to meet the needs of the solar cell industry.  The concept is to crystallize silicon with high relative purity and low cost.  Research at McMaster is aimed at optimizing the conditions that yield a rapid production rate, low impurity content and simple control of the process.

        The high levels of impurities in metallurgical grade silicon will be removed by crystallization from an alloy melt.  The silicon product will be studied microscopically, chemically and electronically to determine the purity.  Concepts for scaling up the production of solar grade silicon will be explored.

"Electrochemical energy conversion devices such as high temperature fuel cells are made of laminated thin films of doped ceramic components and metal-ceramic composites.  The chemical stability of these materials over many years of operation is essential in order to avoid interdiffusion or side reactions that will degrade their performance.  The selection process requires numerous tests of candidate materials with different compositions and dopant concentrations at various temperatures and oxygen pressures.  A more efficient route to the screening of materials is by combining thermodynamic solution models with the use of existing thermodynamic software such as FactSage or Thermocalc.



This project will enable the 'materials by design' concept for solid oxide fuel cells by developing a thermodynamic solution database of ceramic materials.  The ceramics to be modeled are identified by their crystal structures and will include spinels, perovskites, fluorites and pyrochlores.  The data for this project will be extracted from the literature and may include phase diagrams, thermodynamic activities, Gibbs energies, enthalpies, etc.  Sublattice, quasi-chemical and other models will be used to describe mixing in the solutions.  The modeling protocol is well established.  If literature data are inadequate or conflicting, experimental techniques such as x-ray and neutron diffraction, spectroscopy or microprobe analysis will be used to fill the gaps and verify the model.  The database will be incorporated into the FactSage system, which is available by license to users throughout the world.  The new database will enable researchers to calculate equilibrium conditions corresponding to long-term stability of metal and ceramic components for fuel cells and other high temperature applications.

"The primate frontal cortex comprises a large number of areas that have distinct cellular architecture and connectivity with other areas of the brain. These different areas form distinct functional frontal subsystems.  In trying to understand the functional organization of the frontal cortex, the focus of my research has been to identify anatomically these different subsystems, to study the nature of the cognitive and behavioural impairments that follow damage to them, and to study the interactions between these functional subsystems in effecting the high-level control of behaviour and cognition that is the domain of frontal function. In my research, I have shown that patients with frontal cortical excisions exhibit specific impairments in monitoring processes within working memory, as well as impairments in selection between different actions based on learned conditional rules. In work with the monkey, I have shown that specific areas of the dorsolateral frontal cortex underlie these two classes of impairment: the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex (areas 46 and 9) for the monitoring of information in working memory and the posterior dorsolateral frontal cortex (areas 8 and 6) for conditional rule-based choices between responses. In the work proposed in the present grant application, I shall explore the functional contribution of the ventrolateral frontal cortex (particularly a system that controls orofacial action) and the frontal polar cortex (area 10) which, in interaction with areas 46 and 9, may be involved in a hyper-monitoring function that would underlie our ability to multitask. These issues can now be approached in a powerful way because of: a) new experimental paradigms (appropriate for human and monkey studies alike) that we have recently developed, b) the availability of detailed knowledge of the anatomical connectivity of the various frontal cortical areas (to which we have contributed), and c) the results of our recent comparative anatomical studies of the human and the monkey frontal cortex. My research program utilizes behavioural analysis of lesion effects as well as recording the activity of individual neurons in particular areas in an effort to elucidate the functions of this most complex part of the primate brain.

"The mammalian ovary is a complex structure that has unique properties in that it is one of the few structures in the adult that undergoes cyclical angiogenesis.  Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from existing vasculature and occurs as the result of a balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. To date, the function of a number of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors have been characterized in tumour vessels, but limited knowledge is available regarding their function in the ovary.  My laboratory has spent the past 5 years evaluating the expression and function of some of these factors in the ovary.  One of our very interesting and novel findings is that many of these angiogenic factors are also expressed in the extravascular granulosa compartment of the ovary.  The focus of my research program is to evaluate the novel extravascular functions of these angiogenic factors.  In conjunction with this approach, we also plan to evaluate the extravascular and follicular consequences to established anti-angiogenic therapies that are often used to treat diseases such as cancer.  Lastly, we plan to evaluate the expression of angiogenic factors in ovaries collected from individuals with reproductive disorders that are known to involve ovarian dysfunction to identify their potential involvement.  As pro-angiogenic factors have very important vascular and unknown extravascular roles in the ovary, it is intuitive that alteration of their expression through anti-angiogenic therapies would have significant effects on ovarian angiogenesis and granulosa cell function.  Anti-angiogenic treatments may have unanticipated effects on ovarian function and reproductive health of an individual and altered expression of vascular factors in the extravascular compartment of the ovary may be an important component in the etiology of various reproductive disorders.    The results of this program will significantly improve our understanding of the factors that regulate ovarian health and function, and will also importantly continue our commitment to the training of highly-qualified researchers.","Animal management (animal diseases, breeding)","University of Guelph",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Sciences de la vie li�es � la sant� publique et aux maladies humaines","Sciences de la vie li�es � la sant� publique et aux maladies humaines"
"Model-Driven Development (MDD) is an evolutionary step in the software field that changes the focus of software development from code to models. MDD is based on abstraction and automation: abstraction separates the model of the application under construction from underlying platform models, and automation is used to generate the code from models. The platform models (PM) are reusable and layered, each providing services to the layers above, and requiring services of the layers below. The Object Management Group (OMG) uses the copyrighted term Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) to describe the initiative of producing standards (such as UML, MOF, XMI and CWM) for MDD.

The long-term objective of the proposed research is to integrate software performance engineering techniques in the MDD process. Performance (defined here as the degree of providing timeliness) is a pervasive quality of any software system that is determined by all its layers: application, middleware, operating system, hardware (which may be described as layered ""platforms"" in MDD). A performance model would allow us to reason about the performance properties of the system at the level of assemblies of components/platforms early in the life cycle, when the correction of performance problems is easier and more effective. While previous research of the applicant was concerned with the automatic transformation of a monolithic UML model to a performance model, the proposed research will extend the transformation techniques to a set of inter-related UML models that have to be transformed and composed: a platform-independent model (PIM) of the application and reusable models of the underlying platforms (PMs). 

There are three short term goals. The first addresses model transformation techniques for generating an overall performance model from a set of input PIM + PMs annotated with performance information. The second goal deals with separating the performance contribution of each platform through performance annotations, which can be composed later. The third goal applies the proposed methods and techniques to two case-studies.

"Natural and industrial stress is expected to have a pronounced impact on ecosystems in the boreal plain of Western Canada (WBP) but it is not clear how this will affect the cycling and storage of water and carbon in these environments. Boreal wetland pond complexes that comprise the mosaic of this region are sustained by hydrologic connectivity with upland areas. Fluctuations in hydrologic connectivity have implications for carbon cycling in the ponds and peatlands as well as pond permanence and peatland succession. 



Ongoing research in this area shows that on a regional scale, the potential evapotranspiration regularly exceeds precipitation inputs and hydrological connectivity between landscape units is the key determinant to pond and riparian peatland functioning and sustainability. Thus, in this research program, hydrological, biogeochemical and micrometeorological measurements will be made simultaneously at a range of scales, providing a fuller understanding of the hydrological and biogeochemical pathways, and interactions, among different landscape units.



The objective of this research is to examine the synergy of wetland hydrology and ecosystem dynamics in a range of wetland pond complexes in the WBP. The innovations of this research are: (1) ecosystem scale coupling of hydrological, meteorological and ecological process studies; (2) quantifying the overall carbon exchange from this region; (3) identifying the main feedbacks associated with hydroclimatic cycles and carbon exchange; and (4) establishing the linkages between wetland-pond carbon sustainability and catchment hydrology. This will provide a necessary improvement to the modelling of such boreal wetland systems serving as a valuable management tool for conservation groups such as Ducks Unlimited and the oil and gas, and forest industries.",Water,"Wilfrid Laurier University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Hydrologie physique",Hydrologie

"Theoretical and experimental work is planned on a number of different problems in the broad areas of psychophysics, judgement, and decision-making. The primary aim is to determine the fundamental properties of comparative judgments with perceived, numerical, and remembered alternatives. A continuing focus of this long-term research programme is the further development of quantitative models that permit explicit expressions for response times, response accuracy, and confidence. Extensions of these models, both through computer simulation and formal mathematical development, to the multi-alternative case are underway, as are a series of experiments with two, three and four stimulus alternatives. These models will then be empirically examined in the context of continuing experimental work which focuses on the determining how the instructions used in comparison experiments interact with properties of the stimuli to be compared (the semantic congruity effect), the relationships between how we perceive simple sensory events and how we remember them (memory psychophysics), the spatial components in the mental representations of numbers and symbols (SNARC effect), and how we arrive at a feeling of the confidence in the correctness of our decisions and judgements and how closely our expression of confidence relates to actual accuracy of our performance (the calibration of confidence).

"Flocculated or aggregated soils and sediment are a known vector for nutrient and contaminant transfers to and within aquatic systems.  Their behavior and residence time in aquatic systems is a regulating factor in the delivery and retention of materials in rivers, lakes and oceans.  In northern BC the massive pine beetle epidemic has altered the hydrologic functioning of many watersheds.  A suggestion to harvest these regions and change to an agricultural has been suggested by governments. This, in combination with predicted climate warming, implies an increase in field tillage and fertilization in many watersheds. The effect of these potential changes on terrestrial-aquatic connectivity, via soil erosion, suggests that streams will be receiving increased loads of sediment and organic matter.  Some of this material will be delivered to the streams as soil aggregates but as well an instream process of flocculation will occur.  These composite particles can be retained and decomposed in the gravel bed delivering nutrients to the hyporeic and overlying water.  Recent work indicates that a sediment-fish biomass feedback loop helps regulate the nutrient status, and therefore ecological functioning of  salmon spawning, gravel-bed rivers. I propose to investigate if this process operates in other stream systems, dominated by different types of organic matter (agricultural fertilizers, algal blooms, forest litter).  I will quantify the generation, settling, storage, and hyporeic release products of aggregates in artificial streams (flumes).  The magnitude and significance of the bio-physical processes for each of the organic source materials can be determined and then field work in natural rivers will allow a comparison of the flume simulated results.  Basic research investigating riverine floc/aggregate generation, fate and effect will use sedimentological and microscopic techniques, while applied research into the development of a new sediment tracing method using microbial DNA as a hydro-geomorphic tracer will be tested.  This project delivers to watershed management and aquatic habitat restoration concerns that require combined geomorphic knowledge of sediment transfers and ecological information regarding aquatic nutrient transfers.

"Excessive flow-induced vibration can lead to very costly failures in industrial components such as heat exchangers and piping systems.  For example a single tube failure in a nuclear steam generator would lead to a station shutdown and repairs costing some M$2.  Higher performance and improved reliability can be achieved if components are optimised for vibration with accurate vibration information.  This can lead to improved industrial competitiveness and savings in the order of M$100 per year in the nuclear industry alone. Similar arguments can be made in for other components such as hydraulic power turbines.



A comprehensive research program was initiated in 2000 at �cole Polytechnique under the BWC/AECL/NSERC Industrial Research Chair of Fluid-Structure Interaction of which the applicant is the Chair Holder. The Chair program covers vibration excitation mechanisms such as fluidelastic instability, periodic and random excitation in both axial and cross flow. While the Chair program is aimed at the technology needs of industry it raises many fundamental questions that are very appropriate for investigation under a Discovery Grant.



While more than half of process components operate in two-phase flow our knowledge in this area is still very limited.  Thus, it is proposed to study fundamental aspects of vibration excitation and damping mechanisms in two-phase flows. Fundamental studies are proposed in the following areas: 1) Fluidelastic instability of flexible tubes subjected to internal two-phase flow; 2) Periodic vibration excitation forces in two-phase flows; 3) Vibration damping in two-phase flows. Also the presence of the Chair has raised interest in other areas of fluid-structure interaction such as vibration of hydraulic turbines.

"Much of human cognition depends on stored knowledge; that is, the meanings we have learned to ascribe to words, objects, and other aspects of our experience. The focus of the proposed research is the mental process by which such meanings are retrieved. In particular, in the proposed research I will explore how it is that we generate meanings from words. Our perception or intuition about this process is that it is effortless---as we read, letters on a page are translated into concepts and meaning is derived. While this translation process usually feels effortless, the reality of the situation is quite different. Letter patterns are translated into meanings but, in many languages there is little correspondence between words' spellings and words' meanings. Additional complexity is created by the fact that the meaning we derive for a given word will depend heavily on the context in which that word is encountered. Most words have multiple senses or meanings and we use a number of cues in context to decide which sense or meaning is intended. Given these complexities, the challenge for the proposed research is to describe how word meanings are retrieved. The overall strategy I will use to achieve this goal is to capitalize on the variability that exists in the amount of information associated with different words. That is, words vary in the richness of their meanings, and my previous research shows that this variability in semantic richness has consequences for word recognition. Furthermore, one can define semantic richness in many different ways, and as a function of many different conceptualizations of semantics. By examining the extent to which different richness effects are observed, in word recognition behavior and in neural activity and as a function of context, it is possible to test the viability of different frameworks for semantic processing.

The anticipated outcome of this work is valuable new information about how word meanings are retrieved. New understanding about how this process occurs in the healthy mind and brain will provide a framework for understanding the ways in which semantic processing is disrupted in the disordered brain.

1) Streaming Data Models for monitoring B2B networks.  

2) Business Process Management and Service Oriented Architectures for Trusted Information Processes

3) Model-Driven Engineering of Business Processes and Quality Assurance Frameworks



We will leverage standards (BPEL, URN, XACML, TTCN-3) to provide an integrated  model-driven framework for defining and managing trusted information processes.  The focus of the framework is the creation of streaming data models for auditing and monitoring the flow of information between services in a Business to Business (B2B) network with traceability to busines processes, requirements models, compliance policies and performance management metrics.



Health care is an application area for our research. In particular, we are interesed in addressing privacy compliance requirements in order to enable on-line business process management of health care processes.  We have established strong research ties with local health organizations in order to obtain practical use cases with which to validate our research.

"The objectives of the research proposed in this application are to continue our identification of specific neuroanatomical and neurochemical systems that underlie appetitive and consummatory aspects of sexual behavior in female and male rats.  A combination of neuropharmacological and molecular techniques will be used to examine the role of monoamines (dopamine and serotonin), small molecules (glutamate and GABA), and neuropeptides (opioids, melanocortins, oxytocin) within mesolimbic and hypothalamic brain regions in response to different types of sexual stimulation.  These stimuli will include pheromonal cues and genitosensory stimulation. In vivo microdialysis will be used to characterize dopamine, glutamate, GABA (or different neuropeptides) in mesolimbic and hypothalamic regions during sexual interactions.  The research will focus on the mechanisms that control sexual arousal, desire, reward, inhibition, and disinhibition, and will focus on solicitation and pacing behaviors in female rats, and sexual anticipation and chasing behaviors in male rats, in addition to traditional consummatory measures of lordosis and mounting behavior. The development and maintenance of appetitive sexual behaviors appear to require the activation of sexual reward systems following ejaculation in male rats or paced vaginocervical stimulation in female rats.  Our previous work has indicated an interaction between the medial preoptic area and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, the ventral tegmental area of the midbrain, and several amygdala nuclei in generation of sexual reward expectancies.  In addition to studies of appetitive sexual behavior, the neural systems that underlie sexual inhibition will begin to be elucidated by pairing sexually active rats with nonreceptive partners, by examining the mechanisms of sexual refractoriness or estrus termination, and by examining the effects of sexual nonreward during an animal's first sexual experiences.  This work will provide new insights into the neural control of appetitive and consummatory sexual behaviors in rats, behaviors that can be viewed as models of human sexual arousal, desire, and copulatory performance.

We will also be able to address the question whether Einstein's theory of General Relativity is right.



Computer calculations of colliding black holes and other objects described by Einstein's equations are crucial in this endeavour. Because Einstein's equations are so complex, such computer calculations are very difficult and require the largest supercomputers.  This research performs computer calculations of some of the most exciting gravitational wave sources: Two black holes, or one black hole and one neutron star colliding with each other.  The results are then used to find gravitational waves and learn about the Universe.  This research also examines other astrophysical scenarios in which gravity is important, like matter falling into a black hole.

"Water transport is critical to th operation and stability of polymer electrolyte fuel cells.  Unfortunately, the physical mechanisms of water transport on porous fuel cell electrodes and flow channels are poorly understood.  The object of this proposal is to employ combined theoretical and experimental approaches to identify the relevant physics of water transport in fuel cell electrodes.  Several idealized experimental setups wll be made and studied using a micro-PIV system housed at the Queen's-RMC Fuel Cell Research Centre.  These experiments will then provide guidance for the development of new multi-phase flow models suitable for simulating fuel cell performance using computational fluid dynamics.  These models will then be available to guide the next generation of fuel cell designs and aid in the commercial viability of fuel cells.","Energy storage and conversion","Queen's University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Syst�mes polyphasiques","M�canique des fluides"

"The cellular mechanisms involved in the maintenance of pregnancy are not well understood. We have identified a novel steroid hormone called ED, which may play an important role in pregnancy maintenance. We propose to learn more about how this hormone acts. Since ED, like other hormones are present only in small quantities in blood and urine, it is important to chemically synthesize ED so that large amounts are available for a wide variety of experiments. We propose to study how ED affects the fetus, placenta and control pregnancy.   Knowledge gained from these studies may open ways to new discoveries for reducing early pregnancy losses and better management of pregnancy in animals and humans.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","McGill University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Biologie cellulaire","Biologie cellulaire"

"    )	Sounds, by their very nature, are events that take time to unfold.  Much of hearing science has been devoted to the processes involved in detecting sounds, discriminating and identifying them, or locating them in space.  The proposed research specifically targets temporal processes in hearing.  Does the perceptual processing of one sound in some way contaminate the perceptual processing of temporally adjacent sounds?  If so, in what ways?  How truthful to the actual state of the physical stimulus is the unfolding of our private, subjective experience of the auditory world?  How do we appropriately measure the resolution with which our auditory experience unfolds?  The proposed research  tackles these questions directly.  One line of the research is on selective adaptation in hearing.  It explores how experience of a sound at one point along a dimension (e.g., location) shifts sensitivity along that dimension for the next sound that occurs.  A second line of research is on the saltation illusion.  It explores how information about one sound can affect the processing of information about a temporally proximate sound, including the case of the perception of one sound being affected by the occurrence of a later sound.  Our third line of research seeks an empirical answer to a methodological question.  Currently, at least two psychophysical methods are being employed to measure what are called ""auditory gap detection thresholds.""  These thresholds are measures of the shortest detectable period of silence between two sounds, and are thus a measure of auditory temporal acuity.  But do the two methods actually measure the same parameter of perceptual performance?  We suspect that they don't, but that needs to be proved experimentally.  Together, these lines of enquiry build on the breakthroughs made in the preceding two grant cycles, and offer new insights into the temporal properties of processing within the human auditory system.",Psychology,"Dalhousie University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Syst�mes sensoriels -- ou�e",Psychologie

"A ""linear operator"" is a mathematical object which (in many cases) can be represented by a square array (or 

""matrix"") of numbers just like a spreadsheet. By a process called ""matrix multiplication"", such operators

""operate"" on vertical lists of numbers (called ""vectors"") to produce new vertical lists (new vectors). If A is the symbol for an operator and X is the symbol for a vertical list (vector), then we denote the newly transformed

list (vector) by AX. It is especially important to find particular vectors for the operator A, say Y, and particular

numbers (depending on A and Y) say 2 for example so that AY is 2 times Y, in symbols AY=2Y. In this case, we would say that 2 is in the ""spectrum"" of A. That is, the spectrum of A is the collection of all such numbers n for which

there is some vector, say Z so that AZ=nZ. Of course different operators will usually have different spectrums.

   Examples of such operators and their spectrums occur so often in scientific and economic applications that 

students are routinely taught the rudiments of the subject in first year university (or even high school) in the 

guise of ""Matrix Theory"" or ""Linear Algebra"". At a deeper level, these operators are crucial to the understanding of quantum mechanics and all the myriad applications of that field.

   I plan to continue my detailed study of how the spectrums of such operators change continuously as the operators themselves change continuously. This is the notion of ""flowing spectrum"" or ""Spectral Flow"". In particular, it is important to be able to calculate how much of the spectrum changes from negative to positive, 

without having to go through the hugely time-consuming process of calculating all the spectrums at each instant of the flow. My co-authors and I have been developing formulas which do this in many diverse cases.

"There is a growing need to understand bilingualism in younger and older adults because 35% of Canadians are bilingual and the proportion over the age of 60 is increasing.  There is a varying degree of overlap between a bilingual's first (L1) and second (L2) language.  This sharing of information requires executive control to correctly access and produce language-appropriate information when a bilingual is speaking or reading.  Studies have shown that executive control capabilities of older bilinguals are relatively protected against age-related decline.  Thus, I will investigate attentional and executive control in younger and older English/ French bilinguals specifically using language-based tasks in combination with electrical brain activity (ERPs).  Study 1 will examine verbal self-monitoring during picture naming in L1 and L2 when within- and across-language phonological and semantic distractors are present.  The goal is to determine whether verbal self-monitoring is greater in L2 than in L1 (due to interference from L1). Study 3 will examine whether the executive control benefits due to being bilingual have a positive effect on the activation and selection of lexically ambiguous words (i.e., words with the same spelling but two distinct meanings).  Study 3 will examine language as a mechanism for directing attention (i.e., by specifying relationship between objects) in younger and older adults.  Study 4 will examine the neural mechanisms of switching between two languages.  There is a seemingly paradoxical asymmetrical cost, namely that it takes longer to switch from one's weaker L2 to one's stronger L1 than vice versa.  This is likely due to the need to suppress L1 that is required to perform in L2, which must then be overcome to switch back to L1.     Overall, this research program will make a novel and significant contribution by examining the role of executive control in both production (Study 1) and comprehension (Studies 2, 3, 4), by extending current research findings to older bilinguals who represent an extreme test of the importance of executive control, and by elucidating the neural processes involved in the control of language.

"The central part of this proposal has two principal components: the development of a promising novel and robust identification tool for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, and the continued exploration of the functional aspects associated with the establishment of the AM symbiosis. A third component aims to provide a greater insight into the factors responsible for initiating ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal fruitbody formation. For the AM symbiosis, a major challenge that hampers biodiversity studies is the correct identification of the mycobionts. The proposed project will couple classical identification, based on spore morphology, with the design of species-specific molecular probes. This approach will allow identification of AM fungi and the determination of the genetic delimitation of a given species. A second project will investigate cytoplasm streaming, and the movement and activity of organelles in AM fungal germ tubes exhibiting either the fine branching or runner hyphae growth pattern. The phenotypic expression of the extraradical mycelium of genetically distinct clusters of Glomus spp. will also be characterized using the Fractal Dimension Calculator program. For the EMC symbiosis, most fruitbodies develop at the end of summer, after bud set of the host tree. This suggests that plant-derived photoperiod-regulated signals play a key role in triggering the formation of ECM fungal primordia. An in vitro system will be used to test this theory, and to test the effect of diverse treatments on fruitbody formation. The outcome of the research on AM fungi will be the accurate identification of species and an improved understanding of their diversity, biology and ecology. Finally, it is envisaged that investigations into the role of plant-derived signal as potential initiators of ECM fruiting bodies, will have applications in the cultivation and commercial production of edible ECM fungi.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","Universit� Laval",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Mycologie,Microbiologie

"Freshwaters around the world are experiencing algal blooms which directly and indirectly are affecting aquatic ecosystems, the services they provide and even human health. Cyanobacterial (blue-green algal) blooms are of particular concern because they often contain toxins that can affect wildlife, livestock, domestic animals and humans. In Canada there appears to be an increasing incidence of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes, at least in Ontario and Quebec, however, this could simply be due to better reporting since most lakes and rivers have minimal long-term monitoring. Furthermore, there is a strong possibility that these trends are and will be aggravated by climate warming. This project aims to identify, through a combination of empirical, experimental and paleolimnological studies, the environmental triggers of cyanobacterial dominance and, in particular, the drivers of potentially toxigenic cyanobacteria. This will entail a comprehensive synthesis of literature and unpublished data bases to determine whether there is a common nutrient threshold for cyanobacteria dominance or whether this threshold differs across regions and in response to climate variables. Paleolimnological studies in four regions of Canada will help determine when cyanobacterial blooms began and what factors led to their onset. The persistence in lake sediments of the most common cyanotoxins (the hepatotoxic microcystins) will be determined and their use as a potential indicator of past toxic blooms will be examined. Environmental agencies from federal and provincial departments as well as local municipalities are among the supporting organizations for this project.",Environment,"University of Ottawa",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","�cologie aquatique et limnologie","�volution et �cologie"
"Rivers and lakes are critical resources and an understanding of the ecology of these ecosystems is important to the Canadian economy and society at large. My long term goal is to determine the drivers of algal biomass and composition in rivers and lakes in order to develop models that explain their variability through space and time and their response to human impacts. Since algae along with aquatic vascular plants are the base of aquatic food webs, what controls their biomass and composition has both direct and indirect consequences for higher trophic levels and water quality. Algae are also convenient for testing and developing ecological theory: because of their relatively small size and concomitant short generation times they can be manipulated both in the laboratory and in the field. 

Compared to lakes and streams, medium size rivers have not been the focus of as much ecological research in Canada or around the world, yet most large cities are located on rivers and rivers are under considerable anthropogenic stress. Based on sampling of rivers in Ontario, Quebec and BC, we will develop a general model that describes the seasonal changes in suspended algae based on hydrological regimes and water chemistry. Given that rivers are quite sensitive to changes in precipitation, climate change may have predictable consequences on algal communities in rivers. Wetter summers and higher discharge will lead to diatom/green algae dominance, whereas drier and warmer summers may promote cyanobacteria. The second part of this research programme will focus on toxin producing cyanobacteria, which are a growing environmental problem in Canada. We will conduct 1) culture experiments with a common toxin producing cyanobacterium testing the role of light and nitrogen in determining the outcome of competition between toxigenic and non toxigenic strains and 2) lake enclosure experiments where these factors will be manipulated to determine effects on natural cyanobacterial communities. Molecular techniques will be used as well as conventional taxonomy and chemical analyses of cyanotoxins.

"Food & beverage flavor & liking strongly influences what we eat & drink & consequently a range of nutritional & health outcomes. Therefore, individual differences in how we perceive taste & smell ('chemosensory' perception) influence habitual dietary intake & risk of chronic diet-related disease. For example, individuals who sense dietary sugar & fat less intensely may require them in higher concentrations to reach optimal liking & thus habitually consume greater amounts, increasing their risk of energy over-consumption, obesity & related disease states. Genetic variation is a very important source of differences between people in perception of chemosensory stimuli. Two important measures of this are 6-n-propylthiouracil taster status (PTS) & thermal taste status (TTS). The latter is a recently described phenomenon where 20-50% of people experience a phantom taste when small areas of their tongue are rapidly cooled or heated. Interestingly, these individuals (thermal tasters - TT) experience a range of tastes much more intensely than thermal non-tasters, in part because they may possess different variants of TRPM5, a cation channel important in thermal taste & transduction of sweetness, bitterness & umami. Very little is known about the TT phenotype & its underlying genetic basis, thus our main objectives are to (i) fully describe the association between TTS & perception of oral stimuli & odors, including foods/beverages, (ii) determine how TTS associates with liking (a proxy for consumption) of foods/beverages, (iii) determine the relative importance of TTS & PTS in chemosensory perception & food/beverage behavior & (iv) initiate investigation of the genetic variations associated with TT through application of modern genotyping techniques.  Through greater understanding of differences in chemosensation, we will gain fuller knowledge of food-related disease aetiology, with application to designing appropriate health care interventions/services. Canadian food/beverage producers will also benefit with respect to optimizing the flavor of their products & subsequent gain in market share & exploitation of market segmentation based on genetic differences in consumer chemosensation.

"The objective of this project is to discover and develop catalysts for formic acid oxidation that will improve

the power, efficiency and durability of the direct formic acid fuel cells being developed in Canada by our

partner organization. Formic acid fuel cells offer an attractive alternative to methanol fuel cells for consumer

applications because of their higher power and efficiency, and lower cost and complexity. Their safe fuel

capsules can be quicky replaced so that devices such as mobile phones and notebook PCs can be used

indefinitely without recharging. Formic acid fuel cells also have the potential to be an important component in

sustainable energy systems, since formic acid can be produced from biomass, or from carbon dioxide using

renewable energy sources (e.g. solar, wind, hydro), and is much easier to store and transport than hydrogen.

One of the main requirements for advances in formic acid fuel cell technology is the development of better

catalysts. However, the current understanding of the electrochemical oxidation of formic acid is insufficient for

prediction of what will be better than the Pd catalysts that are currently used. We therefore propose to combine

high-throughput screening of Pd alloy catalysts in a multi-anode fuel cell with detailed mechanistic studies,

catalyst-layer engineering, and long-term evaluation in fuel cells. The knowledge and understanding gained

from the screening and mechanistic studies will guide the development of improved commercial catalysts.","Energy storage and conversion","Memorial University of Newfoundland",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","�lectrochimie","Chimie physique"
"Electrochemical reactions have wide ranging applications including sensors, batteries,  fuel cells, and chemical synthesis. However, many desired reactions are slow and inefficient, and therefore impractical. This research program aims to develop new chemistry and composite electrode materials that will lead to better electrodes for a wide range of applications. The focus of the work will be on two reactions that have the potential to greatly decrease the world's dependence on fossil fuel and production of green house gas emissions: ethanol oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction. Both of these electrochemical reactions would be of immense commercial and societal value if they could be carried out efficiently. Ethanol oxidation would be used in direct ethanol fuel cells to operate vehicles and produce residential and consumer electricity from a renewable fuel source (no net carbon dioxide emission), while carbon dioxide reduction would produce fuel from a green house gas. 



In a novel approach to increasing the efficiency of electrochemical reactions (electrocatalysis), we plan to develop new chemistry that will allow us to construct multifunctional electrode materials. Each component of the new material will have a specific function to speed up the overall reaction. Thus, in ethanol oxidation, a carbon or metal oxide support will remove electrons from the ethanol molecules which will be adsorbed onto Pt nanoparticles to break them up. A molecular catalyst (metal complex) at the surface of the Pt particle will release the product carbon dioxide. Similar catalysts will be used to essentially do the reverse of these processes to reduce carbon dioxide to useful fuels such as methanol or formic acid that can be used in fuel cells.



The key challenges in this work are to design and synthesize suitable molecular catalysts, and to attach these to high surface area carbon or metal oxide supports.

"We will investigate how the cytoskeleton mediates cell shape changes, a process that is  fundamental for the development of eukaryotes. The cytoskeleton is composed of filamentous networks of proteins such as actin, myosin and tubulin that provide the architecture of the cell and are carefully regulated to mediate cell shape changes. If cells fail to change shape during development, this failure could prevent proper tissue formation, which would be disastrous for the organism. In addition, cancer cells also undergo shape changes for metastases and tumour progression, by a mechanism similar to cells during development. Recent studies in cell division revealed a role for anillin as a global scaffold and regulator of the cytoskeleton. However most of these studies were done on cells in culture and it is not known if anillin regulates additional contractile events that are relevant within the context of a tissue. I hypothesize that anillin modulates cytoskeletal dynamics to mediate cell shape changes during embryonic development by a mechanism similar to cell division. To test this hypothesis, I will use a combination of molecular, genetic and biochemical techniques using C. elegans embryogenesis as a model to investigate the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics by anillin in vivo. These studies will be of general interest to the public given the fundamental roles that the cytoskeleton has for development and cancer progression.

"To explore the potential responses of northern freshwater ecosystems and their watersheds to climate change and to place instrumental temperature records into a long-term perspective, we will use a multi-proxy paleolimnological approach to generate detailed paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental records from lake sediment archives in the eastern Canadian Arctic. These records will be synthesized and the resulting time series analyzed to allow regional comparisons with ice core data from Greenland as well as with paleoceanographic data from surrounding marine environments. Our central objective is to generate a network of decadal-millennial scale records of quantitative variations in limnological parameters that will provide a better understanding of the range of natural environmental variability in northeastern Canada, and allow us to explore fundamental questions concerning postglacial ecosystem succession in northern landscapes.

In our research to date we have developed new analytical techniques and transfer functions for proxy indicator organisms (diatoms and chironomids) that have generated new insights into Holocene climatic and environmental variability in northern Qu�bec (Nunavik), Labrador and Southampton Island (Nunavut). Over the term of the next Discovery grant, we will extend our biostratigraphical time-series approach into the Foxe Basin region of Nunavut (65�-70�N; 71�-85�W), which occupies a key position between the High Arctic where lakes and the cryosphere show signs of pronounced warming in recent decades, and the Subarctic (Nunavik and Labrador) where these changes are not yet detectable. Building on strong links between paleolimnology and contemporary limnology, our interpretations of past changes in northern lakes and ponds will be combined with research into the present-day functioning of these ecosystems.

The present proposal for northern supplement funding complements my ongoing NSERC-funded research activities on the ""Impacts of climatic change and environmental stress on aquatic ecosystems"" (NSERC Discovery grants 2003-2007, 2008- submitted). It seeks additional logistic support for the continuation of a project that promotes the development of a long-term field-based survey and monitoring network of remote northern lakes and ponds distributed along a latitudinal transect across northwestern Qu�bec (Nunavik), the Foxe Basin region and Bylot Island (Nunavut) (ca. 55-73 degrees lat. N; 77-85 degrees long. W). Repeated observations of selected parameters will allow us to continue our monitoring of limnological change and detect trends in these precious northern freshwater resources, as well as provide baseline data against which to measure ongoing changes in these fragile northern environments. Funding for these survey and monitoring activities will also allow us to better integrate paleo- and neo-limnological approaches (process-based studies) in an effort to improve our understanding of the response of northern freshwater ecosystems and their biota to global climate change, as well as to natural and anthropogenic environmental stresses and disturbances.

"To explore the potential responses of northern freshwater ecosystems and their watersheds to climate change and to place instrumental temperature records into a long-term perspective, we will use a multi-proxy paleolimnological approach to generate detailed paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental records from lake sediment archives in the eastern Canadian Arctic. These records will be synthesized and the resulting time series analyzed to allow regional comparisons with ice core data from Greenland as well as with paleoceanographic data from surrounding marine environments. Our central objective is to generate a network of decadal-millennial scale records of quantitative variations in limnological parameters that will provide a better understanding of the range of natural environmental variability in northeastern Canada, and allow us to explore fundamental questions concerning postglacial ecosystem succession in northern landscapes.

In our research to date we have developed new analytical techniques and transfer functions for proxy indicator organisms (diatoms and chironomids) that have generated new insights into Holocene climatic and environmental variability in northern Qu�bec (Nunavik), Labrador and Southampton Island (Nunavut). Over the term of the next Discovery grant, we will extend our biostratigraphical time-series approach into the Foxe Basin region of Nunavut (65�-70�N; 71�-85�W), which occupies a key position between the High Arctic where lakes and the cryosphere show signs of pronounced warming in recent decades, and the Subarctic (Nunavik and Labrador) where these changes are not yet detectable. Building on strong links between paleolimnology and contemporary limnology, our interpretations of past changes in northern lakes and ponds will be combined with research into the present-day functioning of these ecosystems. We will focus especially on developing a better understanding of limnological conditions during early lake evolution in newly formed landscapes and their repercussions on aquatic biota. We will therefore examine the conditions in lakes in front of retreating glaciers on Bylot Island (73�N) that have affinities with early developmental phases in the history of northern lakes.

"Today, software is an integral part of our infrastructure, and our society increasingly depends on its proper functioning. While we have made substantial progress in creating software tools for proving shallow properties of programs, one important, often neglected aspect of achieving safe and verified software is the language in which the software is written. We advocate a comprehensive approach which supports modelling the operational behavior of programming languages and allows us to specify and verify general safety properties about programs. 



The goal of this project is two-fold: First, we plan to continue our work towards a practical logical framework for modeling formal systems, in particular programming languages, and mechanically checking some of their meta-theoretic properties. While we have made substantial progress towards this goal, there are significant challenges to permit the rapid prototyping and large-scale experiments with safety policies and realistic languages.  Second, the goal is to bring logical framework technology to mainstream programming. This will be an important step towards narrowing the gap between specifications and practical implementations, and facilitate the reasoning about the actual implementation. The objective is to develop a theoretical foundation for the approach based on type theory and logic, build efficient verification and programming tools, and

demonstrate their effectiveness using realistic applications. Our research ultimately contributes towards a safer information technology infrastructure.

"Under conditions of food restriction, animals with access to running wheels show two opposite effects: conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and conditioned place preference (CPP). When novel tastes (beverage or food) are followed by daily bouts of wheel activity rats avoid the taste relative to flavors never paired with exercise. In contrast, rats given a distinctive chamber following bouts of wheel running show conditioned place preference relative to another compartment never associated with wheel activity. Wheel running apparently has bivalent (positive/negative) effects similar to psychoactive drugs such as morphine and amphetamine. That is, the same unconditioned stimulus (US) of wheel running produces both positive (CPP) and negative (CTA) outcomes. The novel aspect of our proposal involves a series of experiments to resolve this paradox. We test three alternative hypotheses for the bivalent outcomes of wheel running: cue-specificity, temporal valance and anticipatory contrast. Cue specificity implies that the effects of wheel running are specific to the cue (taste vs. place), The temporal valance explanation holds that the temporal sequence of cue and wheel running (wheel before or after the cue) determines the bivalent outcomes--the onset of wheel running is aversive and the offset has positive reward value. The anticipatory contrast hypothesis states that wheel running is always positive in reward value. The apparent taste avoidance induced by wheel running occurs because the reward value of the cue (taste) is reduced by the upcoming reward value of wheel running. By resolving the paradoxical effects of wheel running for taste conditioning we hope to contribute to the fields of learning, motivation and nutrition. A long-range objective is to develop a theory of eating and exercise that can be used to understand and ameliorate problems of human anorexia and obesity.

"Our ability to understand and predict climate change is limited due to uncertainties in how humans have modified aerosols (atmospheric particles) and clouds.  This is the most uncertain factor in recent climate change quantified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  This uncertainty is both from the impact that aerosols have on clouds and the impact of clouds on aerosol size, concentration and chemical composition. In this research program, we will investigate the interactions of aerosols and clouds while paying specific attention to the impact of these interactions on climate.  



To help understand and reduce these uncertainties, we will develop a novel computer modelling framework for predicting aerosol and cloud droplet number, size and chemical composition.  This framework will be coupled with cloud models that resolve the large-scale structure and properties of the clouds.  We will use these cloud models to answer questions about (1) how clouds affect the number, size and chemical composition of aerosols and (2) how changes in these aerosol properties feed back on the clouds.  Specific attention will be paid to the affect of organic carbonaceous aerosol, which may affect cloud droplet formation and growth, on the overall cloud properties.  Finally, the information learned from these studies will be used to improve the physics of aerosols and clouds in climate models that generally represent aerosols and clouds poorly.

"This proposal is a request for funding to purchase three pieces of laboratory equipment that will advance research on fungal biotechnology and natural products conducted by two researchers and their students at the University of Manitoba. The three pieces of equipment include a NanoDrop spectrophotometer for quantifying small amounts of RNA and proteins, a refrigerated benchtop centrifuge to extract RNA and protein in high quality yield, and a temperature controlled shaking incubator to maximize fungal growth for production of RNA and proteins.  One of the research programs is that of G. Hausner who studies gene expression and production of novel enzymes that have the ability to allow short fragments of DNA to move within the genome. This has promise for biotechnology advances such as genetically modifying organisms and potentially overcoming the effects of plant pathogens. The other program is that of M. Piercey-Normore who studies the effects of the environment on production of fungal natural products that have medicinal and other activities. The genes that produce these natural products can be controlled by environmental, and hence culture, conditions. Both programs examine expression of fungal genes for different purposes and require this equipment to allow these significant areas of research to progress more effectively.",Environment,"University of Manitoba",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","Expression g�n�tique","Biologie mol�culaire"

"The production of high quality plastic resins via a solution process requires highly sophisticated organometallic catalysts.  In particular, the catalysts need to be able to survive and thrive under extreme conditions of high temperature.  These conditions are generally harsher than most organometallic complexes can withstand, and new catalyst designs are required in order to produce ""extremophilic"" catalysts capable of producing commercially viable polyolefins under such conditions.  



We propose herein to use modern principles of ligand design to prepare new, thermally robust catalysts that will produce high molecular weight polyethylene plastic at high temperatures.  The designs proposed will be prepared and evaluated using the lastest mechanistic organometallic techniques.

"In this era of peak oil, we are in need of new energy sources for powering the planet into the future.  Solar energy is the most abundant of renewable energy, but is diffuse and difficult to harness and convert into useful forms of energy, such as electricity.  New light absorbing materials able to efficiently and economically convert light to electricity are needed and their development is one of the most challenging scientific issues we face today.  Current technology is inadequate due to high costs, low efficiencies and poor processability in the silicon based solar cell materials most commonly employed.



The molecules described herein represent a class of materials that may have suitable properties for behaving as electron conducting materials.  We will be developing methodology to more examples of these types of boron containing compounds, and testing their efficacy as light absorbing materials that can act as n-type semiconductors.  The fundamental knowledge gained will allow us to develop next generation energy conversion materials.

"The ability to selectively activate chemical bonds with high efficiency and then transform them into other functions or usable energy continues to present a ""grand challenge"" to organic and inorganic chemists.  Molecular transition metal organometallic compounds form one class of materials that chemists are studying for use as catalysts for such transformations.  While the 30 transition metals collectively form a sensitive palette of central metals with which to create new catalysts, chemists must also be adept at shaping the electronic and spacial environments about the metal centers through ligand design.  The principles of ligand design, the purpose being to rationally manipulate the behavior of transition metal complexes, are under constant development and refinement.

Our group uses principles of ligand design to engender catalytic reactivity in metals from across the periodic table.  This proposal focuses on three main areas of inquiry:

1) Group 3 Organometallic Catalysts. 

2) Ruthenium Based Olefin Metathesis Catalysts. 

3) Bond Activation in ROH and Related Substrates. 

The projects above provide an excellent training ground for synthetic and mechanistic chemistry, leaving graduates with sound problem-solving skills as well as technical proficiency in synthetic chemistry.

"Parasites are widespread in the environment and are an integral part of natural ecosystems. They can have pronounced or subtle effects on their hosts affecting biochemical, physiological, morphological, and behavioural host traits. Parasites however, are also capable of accumulating pollutants in considerable amounts and thus reduce the negative impact of toxicants on the host. In environmental studies, parasites and their influence on infected individuals and populations are recognized, yet often overlooked, and host responses are often interpreted solely as a result of exposure to environmental pollutants. Overall, the proposed research program focuses on effects of selenium contamination on host-parasite interactions in aquatic systems. Through laboratory experiments the proposed research program will investigate combined effects of parasitism and selenium pollution on survival, swimming performance, energetics, and blood chemistry of fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) and walleye (Sander vitreus). Dynamics of metal accumulation, distribution, and speciation in adult parasites (tapeworms) will be studied by means of mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and synchrotron technology (x-ray absorption spectroscopy.) 

Through the combination of parasitological and ecotoxicological methods new insights into joint actions of natural and anthropogenic stressors will be gained. Results of the proposed research may have implications for future environmental effects assessments and may lead to a better understanding of spread of parasitic diseases in polluted environments.

"Technology in the 21st century will see the emergence of the so-called ""smart materials"" that can autonomously respond to an environmental stimulus by undergoing a change in their physicochemical properties. Ideally, these new multifunctional materials will be a composite of several individual materials combining several functionalities, such as sensing, actuation, or even self-healing. This trend towards new ""metamaterials"", combined with the drive towards miniaturization of technology, has placed thin films and nanostructures at the heart of the development of new materials. Thin films will be increasingly used for a wide range of applications in fields as diverse as microelectronics, information technology, sensors, and integrated fuel cell technology.

In this work, our main focus is on the synthesis of thin films and nanostructures based on functional oxides with a ""perovskite-type"" crystal structure. Such oxides exhibit a large range of different physical properties. One can therefore combine several of these materials with similar structures but diverse functionalities in thin films or nanostructures, to create a large range of multifunctional metamaterials. 

This proposal describes two research directions based on the study of thin films and nanostructures of perovskite-type functional oxides together with characterization at the nanoscale. These two research directions are:

1.    )	Engineered ""multiferroic"" films and structures

2.    )	Nanostructured oxides as materials for new energy applications

To summarize, the objective of this research program is to create the necessary knowledge, expertise and an experimental platform to synthesize oxide-based metamaterials with multiple functionalities from thin film-based functional components. We also intend to capitalize on this expertise to create disruptive technologies in the field of alternative, clean energy sources by using engineered advanced oxides to replace critical components of integrated fuel cells.

"This program of research studies computational and theoretical problems in graphs and networks. Graphs and networks each consist of a collection of nodes, some pairs of which are connected by edges. As one example, consider the network that we can construct from the World Wide Web: let each webpage be represented by its own node and then join node A to node B if webpage A has a link to webpage B.  This example, known as the Web Graph, contains the structural information of the web, but none of its content.  One key question that we now want to ask is whether it is possible to find collections of webpages that share related content, when all we have to work with is the network structure of the Web Graph.

     Another research goal involves studying decompositions of graphs. As an example of a problem that can be modelled as a graph decomposition, suppose that N delegations, each with an equal number of delegates, are in attendance at a convention.  During the convention there is a banquet at which there are only round tables, each able to seat T people.  A seating arrangement of the delegates so that each pair of delegations has two delegates seated side by side, and also so that no pair of people from the same delegation sit at the same table is the same as a type of graph decomposition known as a T-cycle system of order N. One kind of question that we want to study is: how many different seating arrangements are there for particular values of T and N?  Supposing that the delegations have been grouped into alliances such that each delegation belongs to at most one alliance, we can also ask: how many different alliances do there have to be so that there is a seating arrangement where no table has all T of its people from the same alliance (in addition to the previous requirements for the seating arrangement)?  This type of question can be solved by studying colourings of graph decompositions.

     In addition to theoretical advances involving graphs and networks, this research program has applications that range from seating arrangements and scheduling, to intelligence gathering based on analysing networks, to studying genetic and ecological connectivity in marine species, and to aspects of human population genetics.

"An essential component of C. elegans and zebrafish research is the ability to grow the animals at precisely regulated temperatures.  Four different temperatures are frequently used for C. elegans, reflecting 'normal' growth parameters for wild type strains (20oC), temperature sensitive mutant alleles (either 15oC or 25oC) and heat-shock maintenance (33oC).  Zebrafish embryos, once removed from the fish facility, are maintained at 25, 28.5 or 30oC.  Since these temperatures are close to, or below, ambient laboratory temperature (21-22oC), the strains are kept in refrigerated incubators, able to precisely maintain stable temperature setpoints.

   My laboratory has been using refrigerated incubators that are between 20 and 30 years old, (several were inherited from retired faculty when I began in 1991, and I have no record of when they were originally purchased) and they have begun to break down with increasing frequency. The loss of one incubator already has meant that we have been keeping the '20oC' strains at room temperature (which is a couple of degrees higher, and changes through the day depending on room traffic). The zebrafish embryos are currently housed on side warming trays, or in a non-refrigerated bacterial incubator whose temperature fluctuates more than is ideal. 

   Dr. Dawes does not have her own wet laboratory, and has been using our facilities for culture, maintenance and manipulation. Her morphometric analyses require precise temperature regulation throughout the experiment. Between us, we are in constant need of regulated-temperature incubators for the four most commonly used C. elegans culture temperatures.","Medical and health sciences","University of Alberta",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","G�n�tique du d�veloppement","G�n�tique"
"During development of animals, many cells and cell types (including stem cells) make choices as to when and where to change their 'fate'.  These decisions are controlled by pathways of molecules that act both on the cell (outside or extrinsic factors) and inside the cell (intrinsic).  These 'signal transduction' pathways are critically important for understanding these cellular choices.  Fortunately, the molecules in these pathways are often very similar in even primitive animals, allowing us to use simple animal 'models' for these studies.  In this proposal, we want to do experiments that will allow us to understand what allows these molecular pathways to change and evolve, so that different animals have different characteristics from one another.  We will be using a simple animal, the soil nematode Caenorhabditis, examining the molecules that control a simple choice, that between male and female fates.  We have already shown that in two related Caenorhabditis species (elegans and briggsae), that the same molecules act in different ways to control this choice.  In one species, we have identified many of the relevant factors, while in the second, we have not.  The animal model that we have chosen allows us to use many different approaches (genetics, molecular biology, genomics and cell biology). 

   The proposed analysis will i) use forward and reverse genetics to assess the respective roles of the sex determining proteins; ii) Use genetics to identify and characterize novel sex- determination loci (particularly those controlling the sperm/oocyte switch); iii) test the C. elegans homologues of these novel genes for any previously unrecognized role in sex determination; and iv) combine the results from these analyses in the two species (plus previous data from other species) to begin a structure-function analysis of the factors.  The results of this analysis will help to address two important questions in developmental biology.  First, (and most specifically) how does the C. elegans sex determination regulatory hierarchy work at the molecular level?  Second (and generally) how do developmental regulatory pathways evolve?","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","University of Alberta",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�n�tique du d�veloppement","G�n�tique"
"The proposed research program is centred around the use of a world-class micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) system that is to be installed at Queen's University in 2008.  This facility is capable of taking three-dimensional (3D) images of a wide variety of materials, enabling its user to examine key internal features in a non-destructive manner.  Furthermore, those key features can be related to the mechanical behaviour of the material when it is subject to loading.  In this particular study, two distinct classes of materials will be investigated: a metal alloy containing hard particles, and cancellous (i.e. porous) bone.



In the case of the metal alloy, certain physical characteristics of the particle population (i.e. size, shape, clustering) will be detected and measured from 3D micro-CT images.  Those measures will then be correlated with the occurrence of internal voids that nucleate and grow when the material is deformed, a progression of events that often leads to premature failure during the manufacture or in-service operation of structural components, such as automotive frames.



For the cancellous bone study, the integrity of the internal porous structure, made up of inter-connected struts and plates will be examined using 3D micro-CT images.  Key measures of the structure will be identified and related to the stiffness and strength of this type of bone when it is subject to loading.  It is believed that a better understanding of the link between structure and strength in cancellous bone will help to diagnose and assess bone strength levels in patients suffering from bone degenerative diseases, such as osteoporosis.

"Molecule-based materials, in the broad sense, is a term coined essentially to make a distinction between classic inorganic atom-based solids and materials built from pre-designed molecular entities. Thus, instead of high temperature synthesis typical of solid state chemistry, molecule-based materials are obtained through soft routes, traditionally from organic chemistry, coordination chemistry and supramolecular chemistry. As in biological systems, molecule-based materials can be built from several specifically designed unique molecules, where the sum of functions could yield new or non-existing properties. My research program is directed towards the realization of molecule-based magnetic materials where there is interplay between two or more physical properties. Research will focus on the preparation and study of two classes of compounds namely, spin bearing tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) donors and spin crossover (SCO) compounds. In the first project, TTF donors covalently appended with spin bearing verdazyl radicals will be combined together with anions to form solids with magnetic and/or conducting properties. Detailed structural and physical studies of new spin bearing donors will enable us to assess whether or not they are suitable building blocks for the preparation of ferromagnetic conductors. In the second project, a new family of switching materials known as spin crossover compounds will be prepared and studied. These are materials in which for example you can apply light or a change in temperature in order to switch their magnetic behavior.  We are particularly interested in preparing systems where two or more switching units are covalently linked together, since in this way we can investigate how the cooperativity between the units through different linkers affects their switching properties. The greatest challenge is to develop systems that switch at or around room temperature since this would be cheaper for device applications. This program represents a unique approach for the development and understanding of two classes of multifunctional molecule-based magnetic materials that could lead to commercial applications.

"The enteric nervous system is the largest and most complex part of the peripheral nervous system. It is found throughout the length of the intestines and is responsible for normal bowel motility. Thus, abnormal development of the ENS is the main cause of gut motility disorders such as aganglionic megacolon. This lethal condition is caused by the absence of an intact ENS in the terminal regions of the gut; the affected segment stays contracted leading to intestinal obstruction, dilation and severe constipation. Human clinical cases and animal models have led to the identification of several genes important for ENS development. Nevertheless, given the complexity of the ENS, our understanding of its formation is far from complete. In order to identify new genes/loci important for ENS development, I have performed an insertional mutation screens in transgenic mice. Due to random insertion of transgenes in the mouse genome, this screen allowed the identification of three lines of mice, named ""Dapple"", ""Dominant Spot"" and ""Holstein"" that display an aganglionic megacolon phenotype. Genetic studies to date have shown that at least the mutations for Dapple and Dominant Spot are in new genes/loci. The proposed research program is aimed at identifying and characterizing the genes affected by these mutations with a special focus on the Dapple line. Molecular studies to date suggest that reduced expression of the new gene Kiaa1279 is responsible of the Dapple megacolon phenotype. In this regard, I now propose studies to understand the function of the Kiaa1279 gene product in ENS development. Overall, this research program will significantly expand the current limited knowledge of ENS development at the genetic, molecular and cellular levels. This new knowledge will represent key contributions to an important research field which is currently understudied in Canada.","Advancement of knowledge","Universit� du Qu�bec � Montr�al",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Biologie mol�culaire","Biologie mol�culaire"

"As we begin to integrate intelligent autonomous systems in challenging real-world applications, we are confronted with a major scientific challenge: to build intelligent systems that are robust enough to handle the uncertain and dynamic nature of real-world task domains without requiring exact models of these domains.   Some attention has been given to the question of uncertainty in action effect and sensor data, but most existing techniques require a well-defined parameterized representation of the domain.



The long-term goal of this project is the deployment of intelligent autonomous agents in complex real-world domains, including inherently uncertain systems. In support of this, we propose to investigate new models and algorithms for addressing the problem of sequential decision-making under model uncertainty. The first objective of this research is to develop new methods for learning good state represntations directly from data, with a particular attention to domains where the input data is high-dimensional, or the state of the system depends on a long sequence of prevous inputs. The second objective is to improve current methods for joint parameter and value estimation in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes. The third objective is to develop effective methods for dealing with domains where the objective function is unknown or complex.



The research outlined in this proposal falls within a larger research context, which integrates two complementary objectives:  the development of representations and algorithms for decision-making, and their application to the problem of sequential decision-making in health-care domains.  An important aspect of this proposal is that any findings arising from the theoretical investigations will be validated in the context of complex medical and robotic decision-making problems.

"The GRIL: `Groupe de Recherche Interuniversitaire en Limnologie et Environnement Aquatique` is seeking support for a ZooScan imaging system to a inter-university group of four  professors from the Universit� de Montr�al (UdeM), Universit� du Qu�bec � Montr�al (UQAM) and � Trois-Rivi�res (UQTR) for direct recognition, sizing and classification of freshwater zooplankton at coarse taxonomic scales or in functional groups.  The ZooScan system uses a scanning sensor with a custom-built lighting system equipped with a watertight chamber into which samples can be poured, digitized at high resolution, and then recovered without damage. Automatic identification and classification of images can be done using the free open-source software ZooProcess which allows standardized image processing, analysis, and acquisition of metadata. The ZooScan has been successfully used to analyse zooplankton abundance and mass distribution in the Mediterranean and North Seas. We propose to use and adapt this instrument for lake and river zooplankton. This equipment will be the first prototype used for freshwaters in North America. It will be shared by four members of the GRIL to carry out five main projects:   1) analysis of functional groups of zooplankton in boreal lakes and ponds along eutrophication and disturbance gradients, 2) development of a trait-based approach to zooplankton functional biodiversity and early detection of aquatic invaders, 3) analysis of the composition and importance of zooplankton resources for larval development of yellow perch in the St.Lawrence River, 4) analysis of the role of functional groups of zooplankton in mercury transfer in lake food webs, and 5) Archiving of digitized zooplankton samples from lakes of the boreal ecozone in Canada. The ZooScan system will be primarily under the supervision of a postdoctoral fellow (UdeM) previously trained on the ZooScan in oceanography, but also used by another postdoctoral fellow (UQTR) and at least 6 students (2 Ph.D. 4 M.Sc) as well as undergraduate students over the next five years. The instrument will also be available for use by other GRIL members.

"Nine (9) grant eligible members of two (2) groups, the Centre for Particle Physics (CPP) group at the University of Alberta (UofA) and the University of Regina (UofR) group, are collaborating in this MRS application. These groups also support 7 postdocs, 13 grad students and 2 research scientists. In the next three (3) years, the CPP group will grow to include two (2) additional faculty members, in the areas of collider physics and astroparticle physics. This collaborative research effort, (partially) supported by the requested MRS grant, is broad in scope. It ranges from astroparticle physics at SNOLAB (experiments DEAP/Clean, PICASSO, SNO+), through QCD physics with the GlueX and Hall C Collaborations at Jefferson Lab (Jlab) in the US, thence to high energy (HEP) collider physics with the ATLAS collaboration at the European Centre for Particle Physics (CERN) in Switzerland. It should be noted that ATLAS and SNOLAB have been recognized by the Canadian Subatomic Physics community as two (2) of their three (3) ""highest priority"" projects.

         The CPP is a well manned and comprehensively equipped facility that in its totality has no equivalent  in any other Canadian University. We believe that only TRIUMF has similar or superior resources, but with more demand on its infrastructure than we do at the CPP. The research resources available at the CPP at the UofA consist of three (3) major facilities for electronics, machining and computing. These major facilities are complemented by large  assembly areas and an X-ray facility for radiation testing.  Importantly, as part of its SNOLAB initiative, a Radon Free Laboratory and a Low Background Counting Facility will be constructed at the UofA. This MRS application requests the funds to continue the employment of a physicist/engineer (J. Soukup) and a technologist (P. Price replacement) who form the core support of the CPP facility. In addition, we are requesting funds for an  technologist to help support the SNOLAB  initiative spear-headed by two (2) recent hires: A. Hallin (Senior CRC)  and C. Krauss (Ass. Prof). The experiments involved in this initiative are all in the startup phase.

"Symplectic geometry provides the mathematical framework of classical mechanics in its Hamiltonian formulation. It also underlies modern approaches to quantum theories. During the past 20 years, the study of the interactions between classical and quantum systems, as well as the introduction of powerful geometrical and analytical techniques, has led to the discovery of new structures and phenomena peculiar to symplectic objects that have no counterparts in classical differential geometry and topology. 



A central problem in symplectic geometry is to understand the symmetries, also called symplectomorphisms, of symplectic spaces. This includes the study of dynamical properties of individual symplectic transformations, the study of finite dimensional symplectic group actions and, more globally, the study of the infinite dimensional group of all symplectic automorphisms of a given space.



In my research, I am especially interested in the homotopy-theoretical and geometric properties of symplectomorphism groups with a view to related problems in analysis. I plan to further study the homotopy type of symplectomorphism groups of rational 4-manifolds, to determine the homotopy type of some spaces of symplectic and Lagrangian embeddings, to study symplectic conjugacy classes of maximal tori in symplectomorphism groups, and to investigate the classification of low-dimensional symplectic spaces under various equivalence relations. Finally, I would like to explore possible links of symplectic topology with asymptotic geometry and with probability theory.

"A program of research designed to exploit the concept of carbohydrate mimicry is proposed.  The concept is of importance because of the need for tighter-binding drugs or more selective vaccine candidates.  We have chosen several biologically important targets for the development of drug or vaccine candidates.  These include an antibody of importance for the development of a vaccine against dysentry, a critical enzyme (UDP-galactopyranose mutase) necessary for survival of M. tuberculosis (and absent in humans), an enzyme (neuraminidase) critical for the propagation of influenza virus, and an antibody of importance for the development of a vaccine against Group B Streptococcus, the causative agent of meningitis in newborns.

Our approach is based on a detailed knowledge of the interaction between these protein targets and their complementary substrates (ligands).  We will study the conformations and topographical features of the small molecule ligands recognized by the antibodies or enzymes of microbial origin.  This will require a combined NMR spectroscopy/molecular dynamics protocol, coupled to a quantitative evaluation of the contacts between the ligands and their cognate protein receptors.   We propose to develop new experimental and computational methods to generate more reliable models of protein-ligand complexes, and to design new lead drug or vaccine candidates.  

We will then synthesize these new lead molecules and test them for their efficacy of binding to their respective protein targets.  The collective information will lead to a deeper understanding of the requirements for mimics of carbohydrates that can be used to generate tighter-binding drugs or more selective vaccines, and to a broader understanding of the theories of mimicry and molecular recognition.

"Concepts of SuperCritical Water-cooled nuclear Reactors (SCWRs) were studied as early as the end of 1950s in USA and Russia.  After a 30-year break, the idea of developing SCWRs became attractive again as the ultimate development path for water cooling.  The main objectives of using SCWRs are: 1) To increase the thermal efficiency of modern Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) from 30 - 35% to 45 - 48%, 2) To decrease capital and operational costs and hence decrease electrical energy costs (~$1000 US/kW or even less); and 3) To co-generate hydrogen.

  SCW NPPs will have much higher operating parameters compared to modern NPPs (pressure of 25 MPa and outlet temperature up to 625�C), and a simplified flow circuit.  Reactor operation at such conditions requires new fuel-channel design options.  Currently, only one design option has been proposed so far - a SCW fuel channel with a ceramic insert.  However, such a fuel-channel design option has not been proven as a viable option.  Therefore, some alternative (back-up) options for SCWR fuel channels are definitely needed.  Also, achieving higher thermal efficiency requires an addition of steam reheat and corresponding to that an addition of nuclear steam-reheat channels, which might be of different design compared to SCW fuel channels.    

  Therefore, developing alternative fuel-channel design options for SCW circuit and subcritical superheated steam fuel channels will help to design reliable and efficient SCWRs and finally, to achieve the desired higher thermal efficiencies of SCW NPPs.

  Primary target recipients are AECL, NRCan, and other Canadian universities / companies / organizations participating in the National Generation-IV program.  Also, project information will be useful for other universities / companies / organizations worldwide, which participate in the Generation-IV program.

"Water-cooled nuclear reactors operating at subcritical pressures (10 - 16 MPa) started to be developed at the end of 1940s and have been used for the last fifty years.  At the same time, i.e., as early as the 1950s, concepts of SuperCritical Water-cooled nuclear Reactors (SCWRs) were studied in the USA and Russia.  Currently, several countries (Canada, European Union, Japan, Korea, Russia, and USA) have started to work in that direction, building on the successful international deployment of supercritical and ultra-supercritical boilers and turbines for coal-fired power plants.  The main objectives of using supercritical water in nuclear reactors are:

1) Using the increased temperatures and a direct-cycle turbine to increase the thermal efficiency of modern nuclear power plants (NPPs) from 33% to 40 - 45% for electricity production, or more than 50% with co-generation, and

2) Using a more compact design that results in decreased capital and operational costs and hence in decreased capital and electrical energy costs (~$1000 US/kW).

Therefore, the proposed work in support of SCWR activities will consist of the following parts:

1) Creation of a reliable supercritical heat-transfer database for the primary SCWR coolant such as light water and for two modelling fluids such as carbon dioxide and R-134a;

2) Developing heat-transfer correlations for supercritical water, carbon dioxide and R-134a, which can be applicable within a wide range of flow conditions and identify conditions for the deteriorated heat transfer;

3) Conducting analysis to find modelling parameters for scaling from supercritical water to modelling fluids and vice versa;

4) Designing and building a small-scale natural-circulation heat-transfer loop for experiments in supercritical water and modelling fluids at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology.

5) Participating in supercritical forced-convection heat-transfer experiments in water and modelling fluids flowing in tubes and bundle geometries at Chalk River Laboratories and using data from Russian test facilities.

6) Keeping a leading role in the world in developing the SCWR concept through innovative research and world-class publications and presentations; and 

7) Creating an educational basis and training of Highly Qualified Personnel (HQP) in the area of nuclear engineering and thermalhydraulics, whom are desperately needed in industry.

    Long-term objective is a creation of the supercritical-water heat-transfer database for fuel bundles and reliable correlations for calculating heat transfer coefficient at these conditions and limits for the deteriorated heat transfer.  Also, these correlations have to address thermalhydraulics safety issues.

"AN ELECTRIC SPIN ON ELECTRONS: NEED FOR AN HIGH-FREQUENCY VECTOR SOURCE 



 The sheer rapidity at which a computer processes information is due to the facility to manipulate and concentrate electric charges. The elemental carrier of the electric charge, the electron, also performs an action that could very well revolutionize the information technologies. Effectively, the electron turns, or spins, on itself. This rotation, directed by the laws of quantum mechanics, shows new and futuristic characteristics. By measuring the rotation degree around a main axis, an observer will always obtain one of two results: either the electron spins at a certain speed clockwise, or the electron spins at the same speed anti-clockwise. Furthermore, using electric fields, it is possible to excite the electron up to a state where it turns in both directions simultaneously: effectively producing a quantum gate. 



 The instruments requested will be used to precisely control these quantum gates by generating high-frequency electric pulses applied to the sample. These one-electron spin operations are crucial for my research program aiming at manipulating quantum information using electron spins. This will set a milestone in the race to build the first large-scale quantum computer, a technological revolution that will execute tasks extremely faster than the conventional computer. 



 This research program will significantly contribute to the advancement of Canadian research in quantum information. It will also provide with a state-of-the-art university laboratory and expertise for the formation of researchers and engineers eager to work in this extremely promising field.

"The rapidity at which a computer processes information is due to the facility to manipulate electric charges. The elemental carrier of the electric charge, the electron, also performs an action that could very well revolutionize the information technologies. Because of an intrinsic angular momentum, it is as if the electron turns, or spins, on itself. This property, known since the beginning of quantum mechanics, has been harnessed only recently. By measuring the rotation around a given axis, an observer will always obtain one of the two following results: either the electron spins at a certain speed clockwise, or the electron spins at the same speed anti-clockwise. These two states can be used to encode one bit of information at a very small physical scale: the size of the electron itself. Furthermore, using magnetic fields, it is possible to excite the electron to a state where it turns in both directions simultaneously, effectively implementing a quantum logical operation.



The objective of my research program is to exploit these spin properties to encode and manipulate information using quantum physics. This is not a simple task since electron spins easily loose their quantum properties due to fluctuating magnetic fields in their environment. The program will first improve the quantum robustness by ""cleaning-up"" this noisy environment. Using transistor-like devices called quantum dots and novel approaches to manipulate electron spins selectively, a small-scale quantum register will then be fabricated to demonstrate proof-of-principle concepts of quantum information processing. Finally, two distant spins will be coupled via a quantum bus, a critical step towards linking several of the above registers together. 



This research program will set a milestone in the race to build the first large-scale quantum computer, a technological revolution that will execute tasks extremely faster than the conventional computer.

"Blood cell production is a complex multi-step process that originates in a rare subpopulation of self-maintaining stem cells. Significant interruption of blood cell production activates these stem cells and stimulates them to regenerate the system. Most of the blood stem cells normally reside in the bone marrow, but they do also spontaneously enter the blood stream and then return to the bone marrow. The latent regenerative activity of blood stem cells in combination with their ability to efficiently re-home to the bone marrow following intravenous injection are the basis of bone marrow transplant therapies now in clinical use worldwide. A powerful application of this approach is to harvest stem cells from patients with genetic disorders, correct the defect ""ex vivo"" and then attempt to cure the patients by transplanting them with their own, corrected stem cells. This type of stem cell-based gene therapy strategy offers the potential of enormous benefit to many patients with congenital disorders like 6-thalassemia and sickle cell disease - 2 inherited diseases that adversely affect the lives of millions of people around the world. However, significant hurdles continue to prevent stem cell-based gene therapies from becoming a practical clinical procedure. Blood stem cells are transduced very inefficiently and they also differentiate rapidly as soon as they are placed in culture. To address these issues, a unique team of bioprocess engineers and stem cell medical researchers will evaluate and bring forward several novel reagents they have recently identified as able to circumvent these problems in model systems. The success of this project will thus greatly advance the possibility of permanent cures for patients with a wide variety of blood disorders that afflict thousands of Canadians and their families, and for which there are currently no known alternatives beyond palliative treatments.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","University of British Columbia",2,"CHRPJ ","Collaborative Health Research Projects","G�nie biom�dical","G�nie biom�dical"

"Over the last few decades an array of new financial products have emerged, some of them written on non-tradable underlings. These financial products are the output of a process called securitization that transforms non-tradable risks into tradable financial securities. Thus, the result is a new financial product which can be regarded as a vehicle to transfer non-tradable risk to financial markets. One example of non-tradable risk is weather risk and this affects many businesses. The natural question which arises is: What should be the fair price to be charged for such a financial product? One possibility is the equilibrium price. Equilibrium prices are the prices for which the market clears, that is the market  participants act optimally in such a way that the demand for the financial product equal the supply. Equilibrium pricing has been widely studied especially in complete markets (markets in which perfect risk transfer is possible). In reality markets are incomplete (for many reasons: illiquidity, trading constraints, idiosyncratic risk etc.) and this renders the analysis more complicated. In this project we focus on models where risk limits are imposed on market participants portfolios and we analyze the effect of idiosyncratic risk on equilibrium prices. Reducing the risk exposure by imposing risk limits is part of the new risk management regulations (Basel I and II accords). Idiosyncratic risk is the risk of price change due to the unique circumstances of a specific security and/or market participants. Although there are available examples of equilibrium pricing in incomplete markets, there is still need for a better mathematical framework for characterizing and computing the equilibrium prices. The project intellectual merit is the mathematical and financial framework which allows for numerical computation of equilibrium prices. Further it suggests how the financial products should be designed in order to be efficient in mitigating and transferring risk. The broader impact of this project is that the method proposed can be extended to other financial economic models. More specifically our methodology can be used to analyze the relationship between rates of assets return and aggregate consumption in incomplete market paradigms.

"Northwestern Canada has experienced the greatest warming in Canada during the past 50 years and numerous dendroclimatological studies also suggest that the 20th century may have been the warmest period during the past 3 centuries or more. Climate modeling experiments suggest temperatures will continue to increase in this

region during the current century. Such increases in temperature are likely to have dramatic impacts on northern ecosystems, including altering the composition and position of some biomes, altering the response of biotic communities to climate or possibly changing the frequency and intensity of disturbance events. This

research will have three main objectives: 1. Determining the controls on tree growth at northern treeline. To investigate this automatic point dendrometers will be used to measure tree growth at very high temporal resolution (every 15 mins.) during the growing season in the eastern Mackenzie Delta region. Onsite climate data will also be collected using a portable weather station. The climate data will be used to develop a

mechanistic model of tree growth which will greatly improve our understanding of climate-growth relations. 2. Investigating the utility of alternative proxy indicators from tree ring growth records for studies of past climate. Given divergence between tree growth and climate, alternative data sources need to be investigated to develop

accurate reconstructions of past climate and to put recent climate change in a long term context. We will expand on our initial work developing annually resolved records of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes from tree rings. We hope to develop a millennial length isotope record from northwestern Canada so that comparisons can be made between recent warming and the so-called Medieval Warm Period. 3. Determining

the natural frequency of forest fires and the impact of fire on succession and development in boreal type forests of northwestern Canada. Using high-resolution lake sediment records and tree establishment and fire scar records we will reconstruct fire frequency during the Holocene. These types of records will help us better constrain the natural fire frequency in the northwest of Canada.

"A promising approach aimed at ultimately resolving the P versus NP question is proof complexity.

For example, lower bounds for Cutting Planes proofs implies lower bounds for a broad class of linear-programming algorithms for SAT and other NP-hard problems.

"My research aims to assess and mitigate the impacts of fisheries on aquatic ecosystems; exploitation in aquatic food webs shifts the balance between schooling pelagic fishes and demersal fish, and hence affects the long-term sustainability of human fisheries. New approaches, methodologies and tools are employed as hypothesis testing engines. In particular my research focusses on how  historical reconstruction of past ecosystem states provides quantitative long-term management goals and a template against which management options can be evaluated. The work employs several types of dynamic numerical ecosystem modelling, including spatial models, that allows tests of hypotheses about how fisheries alter the trophic structure, habitat, species diversity, keystone species and life history characteristics of organisms in aquatic ecosystems. This methodology makes it possible to carry out thought-experiments, since real ones are both impractical and

unethical. Historical case studies use spatial simulation techniques, including the recovery of fish and fisheries in depleted, overfished and polluted systems, the effects of no-take marine reserves, sectoral closures and human-made reefs. The work attempts to emulate important ecological processes in plankton dynamics, trophodynamics, habitat structure and life history parameters. Models are improved by challenging them with considerable amounts of data from surveys and experimental analyses. Parameter uncertainty is accounted by for Monte Carlo techniques while climate fluctuations are simulated using a range of environmental forcing

functions at selected nodes in the ecosystem models; risks are evaluated using  semi-Bayesian Monte Carlo techniques. I am also further developing a multi-disciplinary rapid evaluation technique, termed ""Rapfish"", that uses non-parametric ordination and fuzzy logic to provide numerical scores, with confidence limits, that express compliance with stated management goals, such as sustainability, or compliance with international codes of conduct. Case studies come from a wide range of temperate, tropical and polar ecosystems.","Commercial fisheries","University of British Columbia",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Gestion des ressources renouvelables et non renouvelables","Autres �tudes en sciences naturelles et en g�nie"
"The primary objective of the proposed research is to develop and evaluate high and low performance strains of Chinook salmon for direct or hybrid use in the Organic Salmon Aquaculture industry on the west coast of Canada.  The strains and hybrids must therefore not only have high growth and reproductive performance, they must also have exceptional disease resistance, because theraputant use is not possible. We will address our objective with 4 broad goals; 1) use the existing selected high and low survival lines of Chinook salmon at our Industrial partner's (Yellow Island Aquaculture Ltd.; YIAL) facility to carry out a quantitative genetic breeding experiment, 2) evaluate the status of the previously-developed performance genetic markers in the YIAL selected lines as well as in the offspring from the quantitative genetic breeding experiment, 3) measure life-stage specific performance (e.g. survival, growth) in the offspring from the breeding experiment, and 4) determine the genetic basis of performance traits and estimate genetic correlations among traits. Since we will follow individual offspring from 100 family groups using Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag technology, we will be able to determine the heritability for specific traits of value to aquaculture and other genetic parameters that may add performance to the lines. The potential for commercial marketing of this research is good, both within Canada and for export. The proposed research will not only provide an opportunity for the academic partners to collaborate with the Canadian aquaculture industry, it will generate applied and basic science, highly trained students and scientific publications.

"At the most fundamental level, evolution can be thought of in terms of gene frequency changes over generations. As such, one of the goals of evolutionary biology is to explain why some individuals pass on their genes more successfully than others. My research program falls neatly within this goal of evolutionary biology because it elucidates factors that can affect female choice and male-male competition (i.e. sexual selection), which alters reproductive skews and thus can be responsible for changes in gene frequencies from one generation to the next. A major challenge within the field of sexual selection is to understand how and why females benefit by mating with certain males (or multiple males), which provide no paternal care or material resources. Theoretical models that account for the evolution of mate choice in such non-resource based mating systems requires that females obtain a genetic benefit through increased offspring fitness from their choice of mates. Empirical studies suggest that choosy females can improve the genetic quality of their offspring by mating with males that have good genes (alleles that increase fitness independent of the architecture of the remaining genome) and/or compatible genes (alleles that increase fitness only when in specific genotypes). With the emergence of powerful molecular techniques, evolutionary biologists are now on the verge of being able to provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of mate choice for genetic quality. My long term research goals will focus on four major areas associated with mate choice for genetic quality in fishes: (1) genetic basis of mate choice; (2) major histocompatibility complex; (3) genetic architecture of sperm competition; and (4) mating system evolution. Experiments will: (1) use quantitative genetics to identify sources of genetic variation; (2) examine pre- and post-mating paternity biasing mechanisms; (3) examine genetic quality as it pertains to reproductive success; and (4) develop a new and superior mating system for studying mate choice and genetic quality. These experiments will provide the foundations for a long-term research program on genetic quality and will provide training of highly qualified personnel.

"Ecologists often make simplifying assumptions about the degree to which species that are found together within communities differ from one-another.  Such assumptions are necessary because details concerning the ecologies of most species remain unknown.  One widely held assumption, which stems from conventional niche theory, is that coexisting species are different enough that their respective distributions and abundances are governed primarily by the suitability of the local environment, and only minimally by competition with other species, or by regional-scale processes such as dispersal.  In practice, this 'environmental determinism' assumption will be violated to varying degrees, and this has implications for both basic and applied ecology research.  My research uses both data-mining techniques and computer simulations of ecological communities to ascertain when, where, and by how much we should expect the environmental determinism assumption to be violated.  It also seeks to understand how violations of the environmental determinism assumption might affect the performance of predictive models in ecology, such as those used in global change research, and in environmental monitoring and assessment programs.

"Long term changes in the brain following neonatal seizures



There is now overwhelming evidence that the neonatal brain is very plastic or changeable, whereby even relatively innocuous interventions (eg small changes in maternal care) can have long lasting effects upon adult physiology. Febrile convulsions (FC) are seizures induced by fever that affect 3-5% of children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years; they are the most common type of convulsion in humans. There remains substantial disagreement regarding their effects on the developing brain, both in the acute period, and in the months to years after the initial event. It is difficult to believe that an 'electrical storm' where there is repetitive, virtually runaway excitation of major parts of the brain is not without lasting changes on brain structure, pharmacology and excitability. We have developed a FC model to enable us to elicit a FC and then ask how the brain is changed in adulthood. Using this approach we have preliminary evidence that there is  increased excitability in the brain in adulthood after a neonatal FC. I am seeking funding to follow-up on this finding to discover underlying evidence for, and mechanisms of brain plasticity after a neonatal FC.  My overall hypothesis is: 

Neonatal febrile convulsions produce long-term cellular, molecular and electrophysiological changes in the brain.

My specific questions are:

1.    )	Do neonatal FC alter brain excitability in adulthood?

2.    )	Is there a change in the intrinsic excitability of the hippocampus?

3.    )	Are there molecular and structural changes in the hippocampus after neonatal FC?

I will pursue these questions using our well described animal model and a combination of in vivo behavioral, in vitro electrophysiological and molecular approaches that are well established in the lab.

"A `cellular automaton' is an infinite grid of interacting, identical, simple computers (called `cells'). Although each cell is very simple, their interactions can give rise to complex emergent phenomena,  so that the grid as a whole resembles a `virtual universe' with some kind of `virtual physics'.



    Some cellular automata spontaneously organize the grid into checkerboards, stripes, or more complex patterns of cell-activation.  Often, two adjacent regions will independently and simultaneously self-organize into patterns which are incompatible with one another; the boundary between these two regions is then called a `defect'.   (For example, imagine two workers tiling a floor in a checkerboard pattern, who start from opposite walls.  When they meet in the middle, the two checkerboards don't line up properly;  this is analogous to a kind of defect called a `dislocation'.)    Other defects can form as localized imperfections in the midst of a properly patterned region (like a hole in an otherwise properly tiled floor).  



   The same self-organizing tendencies which create the patterns also act to stabilize these defects, so that they persist over time, moving and interacting like virtual particles, or like undulating strings and membranes.  The goal of this research is to understand the dynamics which governs the formation and interaction of these defect structures.

"The Earth's climate is constantly changing.  Over the past three decades, global temperatures have increased at an unprecidented rate and this trend is expected to continue.  Images from remote sensing satellites allow us to observe and monitor how climate change has been affecting the Earth.  By observing how a particular ecosystem has been responding to changing climate conditions we can learn more about how these areas might react in the future.  



When we experience a particularly warm winter or unusually wet summer we are tempted to attribute it to climate change.  In reality, however, the abnormal weather may just be a part of the natural variation inherent in climate.  To help separate the significant changes from natural variations, climatologists have long used an averaging period of 30 years to define ""normal"" conditions to which the abnormal events are compared.  While it may be instructive to learn that a period of unusual weather is statistically different than the climatological normal, this does not tell us what sort of real effect it is having, particularly on natural ecosystems.  Thus it may be more informative to assess the importance of a climate variation by noting the magnitude of its environmental impact rather than just its atmospheric impact.  In this research I develop a method to create an ""environmental normal"" that can be used to quantify where, when, and how big such environmental impacts are.  The environmental normal, derived from a 30-year archive of remote sensing images, identifies the range of typical conditions that can be expected in an ecosystem.  



In this study I will create an environmental normal for the northern mixedgrass prairie ecoregion of the Great Plains of North America.  This region is significant because less than one-quarter of Canada's original prairie remains but these grasslands are home to 70% of Canada's endangered species.

"Classifying biomedical data involves finding a mapping (relationship) from patterns (e.g., data relating to some type of tissue) to a set of classes (e.g., disease states). Patterns are represented by features (e.g., concentrations of biological compounds) and class labels are assigned using a reference test (RT) (e.g., a medical expert's analysis of tissue being ""normal"" or ""abnormal""). This process often suffers from three significant challenges: the RT may be unreliable; the number of patterns is low; and the number of features in a pattern is high. While RTs may be well-established benchmarks, they are seldom perfectly accurate and sometimes improperly applied. Nevertheless, any strategy that compensates for this imprecision must ensure that the mapping is correctly validated against the benchmark. The last two challenges, known collectively as the ""curse of dimensionality"", cause an inability to find robust, general solutions. This is often addressed by transformations that select the most discriminatory subset of features while not impeding the medical expert's ability to make informed judgments about the mapping's predictive power. 

Techniques using Computational Intelligence (CI) - adaptive, learning, or evolutionary algorithms - have demonstrated their effectiveness in data analysis. This proposal involves the development of a comprehensive CI based Classification Methodology to mitigate the effects relating to many features, few patterns, and an unreliable RT. Its novelty and significance is in its tightly integrated approach, where the enterprises - accurate classification, effective feature reduction, unreliable class assignment mitigation - incrementally inform and drive each other in a unified manner. This methodology will be instrumental in the analysis of complex biomedical data and will lead to more reliable classification systems. Further, while this investigation involves methodological and foundational concepts, it will simultaneously deal with ""real-world"" data. Finally, by collaborating with biomedical experts, the fundamental knowledge created by this investigation will generate tangible practical outcomes for the biomedical research community.","Information, computer and communication technologies","University of Manitoba",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Analyse de formes et intelligence artificielle",Robotique

"My research program aims at understanding the basic mechanisms by which the brain in general, and neuronal networks in particular, reorganize following lesion. With my research team, I study the physiological and environmental conditions that promote recovery of function. To study this functional plasticity I use a rat model of global ischemia that mimics the neuronal damage and functional deficits observed in humans following cardiac arrest or stroke.  In this rat model, the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus is extensively damaged and this leads to learning and memory deficits and stress reactivity. In the last few years, my students and I have demonstrated that the functional recovery of these deficits can be enhanced by physiological (i.e., ischemic preconditioning, CRH stimulation) and environmental factors such as food restriction and certain nutritional supplements such as fish oil. An interesting aspect of the functional effects seen following exposure to environmental factors is that they take place without apparent changes in ischemic neuronal injury, suggesting that they are induced via alterations of other neuronal circuits and/or biochemical changes. The present research program aims to target some of the processes that may underlay functional plasticity and cognitive improvement induced by environmental factors.  Its multidisciplinary approach will prepare students to contribute significantly to understanding the determinants of recovery processes following brain injury.",Psychology,"University of Ottawa",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Psychologie,Psychologie

"During recent past decades, harmful algal blooms have increased world wide in aquatic ecosystems, and not only in eutrophic ecosystems. In continental waters these blooms are mainly due to potentially toxic blue-green algae (cyanobacteria). The relationship between blue-green blooms and lake fertilisation by nutrients, particularly phosphorus (P), is known since the early 70s. The question today is why the blooms also occur in lakes with low nutrient concentrations in their surface waters. In some of these lakes external P-loading has been decreased in the last 20-30 years, in others external anthropogenic sources are unknown.  In these low surface nutrient lakes the occurrence and intensity of the blooms varies between years. Recently, the increase of noxious blue-greens has been attributed to global warming, and the author of this hypothesis advocates for more detailed studies of climate change and population dynamics of bloom-forming blue-greens. In our 5-yr study we wish to verify some of the mechanisms related to climate that could control algal community structure and blue-green blooms in small lakes. In particular, we want to measure the importance of wind-induced physical forcing at the bottom of lakes (benthic boundary layer) in the fluxes of nutrients and organisms from littoral and deep habitats to the water column (pelagic habitats); and between physically constrained adjacent areas (e.g. thermocline in stratified lakes). Our hypotheses are that: i) it is the P-accumulated in the sediments that allows the growth of the bottom resting stages of algae in lakes with low external P loads and, ii) the intensity of the physical forcing of nutrients and organisms through boundaries links the different habitats (from the bottom to the water column and through the water column) and creates a positive or negative feedback in algae recruitment. Our study constitutes a novel approach to explaining the inter-annual variability in algae community structure in stratified lakes and may explain cyanobacteria blooms. Our understanding of the importance of the physical forcing on ecological processes in stratified small lakes should produce better tools for noxious bloom management and control.","Oceans and inland waters","Universit� du Qu�bec � Montr�al",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","�cologie aquatique et limnologie","�volution et �cologie"

"The research agenda of the Healthcare Support through Information Technology Enhancements (hSITE) NSERC Strategic Network Grant proposes to develop an application-driven program of engineering research to design novel, advanced communications systems and infrastructures to improve healthcare efficiency through improved workflows, patient care, and safety. hSITE research targets advances in the areas of wireless communications, networking, middleware architecture, location technologies and smart systems with the goal of developing a smart, context-aware infrastructure that seamlessly follows the clinician, integrates into clinical workflows and provides the intelligence, dependability, ease of use, and flexibility needed to meet the demanding requirements of a clinical environment. The network has been divided into three research themes linked by cross- cutting healthcare contexts: Theme 1 is dedicated to identifying the requirements; Theme 2 focuses on the user interface, including software applications and sensor systems; and Theme 3 is devoted to the development of systems and networks architectures that will be able to meet the requirements of the hSITE application space. The systems developed within hSITE will be prototyped and evaluated within the context of a demonstrations and prototypes theme. Revised requirements and design recommendations will be identified as a consequence of the evaluation of designed prototypes. This information will then be communicated among themes using user interface mock-ups and prototypes as a detailed specification of how the technologies and the architecture should provide data and information to users within workflows. The proposed research structure is designed to achieve focus, coherence, and efficiency in executing the hSITE research vision while establishing a close link between clinicians and their needs, and engineers and their solutions.","Information, computer and communication technologies","McGill University","1 & 2","NETGP ","Research Networks","Th�orie des t�l�communications et de l'information","Technologie de l'information"

"The aerospace industry is facing strong political, social, and economic pressures to develop cleaner and lighter aircrafts made from environmentally friendly materials and using energy efficient technologies. One key technology is the development of ElectroMechanical Actuators (EMA) to replace conventional hydraulic actuators for primary flight control surfaces.

The main issue of developing practical EMA for primary flight control is reliability. The objective of this research is to investigate the potential of using redundant rotary motors, notably electric gear motors, for reliable airplane and helicopter primary flight control. With redundant electric gear motors, at least two motors (or one motor and a mechanical linkage) are connected to one flight surface using clutch elements. If a motor or gear reduction fault occurs, the system disengages the clutch of the faulty unit and remains functional.

The research will develop optimal system architectures (e.g. number of motors, spatial configuration, control strategies, fault detection) as well as reliable and high power density clutching technologies to connect/disconnect each motor unit. Design requirements will be derived from a Bell helicopter model 407 helicopter. Optimal system architectures and clutching technologies, in particular, MR-fluid clutches will be developed using state-of-the-art engineering tools such as finite element and system dynamic models. Finally, proof-of-concept demonstrators will be designed, fabricated, and characterized experimentally.

The research will advance the field of EMA by assessing the performance of new actuator concepts, by developing new modeling techniques, and by advancing the field of MR-fluids clutch design for the control of high power mechanical systems. The research will provide Canadian aerospace industry with proprietary new technology that will become a strategic asset for Canada's competitiveness in the aerospace sector.

"Dielectric Elastomer Actuators are a new class of all-polymer actuators for robotics and mechatronics. The main attraction of these actuators is that they show good overall performance (force-to-weight of 100:1, extensions of 200%) while being simple and low cost.  These actuators have the potential to drastically change the design and control paradigms of robotic systems.  In contrast to current technologies like DC motors and pneumatic cylinders, very large numbers of Dielectric Elastomer Actuators, up to 100 to 1000, can be used in a robotic system without significantly raising costs. Advanced robotic systems such as binary robotics or smart structures with embedded actuators are now possible.



Today, Dielectric Elastomer Actuators are still an emerging technology that is not completely understood. The proposed research investigates three important remaining road blocks in the development of practical Dielectric Elastomer Actuators for robotic systems. In particular, the research will: 

1) Investigate experimentally and analytically how Dielectric Elastomer Actuators age over time (creep) and after numerous actuation cycles (fatigue).

2) Develop design and manufacturing guidelines for practical actuators with high reliability and large forces (>10N).

3) Study robotic systems architectures that respect the nature of Dielectric Elastomer Actuators.



The findings of this research will be applied to the development of a functional robotic system for Magnetic Resonance guided biopsies and brachytherapies (implantations of radioactive seeds) for prostate cancer. This device could have an important impact on prostate cancer, the second largest cancer killer in men, by improving treatment accuracy and reducing procedure duration.

"My research centres on three areas: statistical methods for meta-analysis, causal inference, and methods for pregnancy outcomes. With Khajak Ishak (PhD graduate 2006) I have done extensive work on meta-analysis of multivariate data. We demonstrated that meta-analysis of multivariate data does not always provide benefit, in particular when correlation between the multivariate outcomes comes from sources other than correlation among treatment effects (eg study heterogeneity). I will continue to work on a new model for multivariate outcomes based on a Bayesian approach to a multinomial distribution, and individual patient data (rather than summary data). Iwill implement our model using frequentist and Bayesian analytic techniques, both in simulation and in real data. As I and others have noted, pregnancy outcomes pose many statistical challenges. In particular, I am interested in the role of gestational age. Gestational age is an important perinatal predictor,  but is subject to both systematic and random misclassification. I will extend my work on measurement error in gestational age to multivariate data; when information on birth length, head circumference and other characteristics are available, they should provide added information on the likelihood of errors in gestational age.  In addition, I will develop a more general model for this measurement error, of which my original model represents a special case.  Typical analyses of gestational age have treated the measurement error and subsequent analyses as separate problems. Bayesian approaches to survival analysis.  Finally, I intend to apply the theory of causal inference based on potential outcomes (Rubin 1976, Robins 1987 and subsequent papers) in several settings. I will develop and compare methods for model selection for inverse probability weighted estimation procedures, and develop principal-stratification based methods for randomized trials with noncompliance.","Medical and health sciences","McGill University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Biostatistiques,"Statistique et probabilit�"

"My long-term research goal is to identify the molecular, regulatory, and functional properties of key enzymes of plant carbohydrate and phosphate (Pi) metabolism. Our detailed biochemical characterization of purified enzymes was recently augmented by various innovative proteomic and genomic tools, resulting in several fascinating discoveries concerning the control of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) metabolism in the triglyceride-rich endosperm of developing castor oilseeds, and the biochemical adaptations of Pi-deprived (-Pi) Arabidopsis thaliana. PEP carboxylase (PEPC) is an important and 'multi-faceted' allosteric enzyme situated at the core of primary plant metabolism that participates in the control of seed carbohydrate partitioning to agronomically important end-products such as storage oils and proteins, but also helps plants to cope with suboptimal Pi, one of the least available macronutrients in many soils. Proposed research is focused on the: (A) functional properties, protein interactions, and subcellular localization of novel Class-1 & Class-2 PEPC isoforms of developing oilseeds, & (B) properties and Pi-scavenging functions of a PEPC isozyme that is reversibly accumulated and phosphorylated by -Pi Arabidopsis (hypothesized to result in excretion of Pi-solubilizing organic acids by roots of -Pi plants), as well as the predominant intra- & extracellular purple acid phosphatase isozymes upregulated by -Pi Arabidopsis (hypothesized to help recycle Pi from intracellular and soil-localized Pi-esters). Our studies have significant applications to problems in Canadian agriculture including the: (i) targeted modification of storage oil vs. protein levels in oilseeds such as canola or soybean, & (ii)  development of Pi-efficient transgenic crops, urgently needed to reduce mankind's rampant but inefficient use of non-renewable, unsustainable, and polluting Pi fertilizers. During this granting period we will continue to integrate new proteomic and genomic tools into our research. These innovations require retooling, training, and optimization, but provide quantitative advances in the types of data that we can gather, and a solid foundation for HQP training in modern plant metabolic biochemistry.","Plant production and plant primary products","Queen's University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Enzymes,Biochimie

"Insect pests, such as the cabbage looper or the spruce budworm (both moths), cause significant damage to crop and forests, respectively. Further, some pest insects transmit diseases to humans (e. g. malaria mosquitoes) or to plants (e. g. bark beetles). Control measures include insecticide treatments, which are effective only if the majority of insects in the target population are susceptible to the insecticide. A major problem we face today is the increasing resistance of insects to insecticides. Pressure for intensive production of agricultural and forestry products will increase dramatically in the coming decades. In addition to food, fibres, building materials and pulp, the demand for fuel and chemical building blocks will increasingly be satisfied by products coming from fields, greenhouses and forests. This will bring with it a pressing need to develop sustainable, effective, long-term insect control measures.

In this application we propose to research sustainable alternatives to insecticides: deterrents and chemosensory inhibitors. Insects decide where to feed, lay eggs and when to reproduce using chemical cues from the environment (general odorants or tastes) and from members of their own species (pheromones). We propose to discover and develop compounds that mimic either general odorants/tastes or pheromones and inhibit the insect's response to the natural cues. We will focus on the behaviour of the insect that causes crop damage or disease transmission. The target insects for our study are: cabbage looper, gypsy moth, spruce budworm, the pine engraver (a bark beetle) and the malaria mosquito. We will design and synthesize the compounds and test them against the insects to find candidates that deter the insects and/or mask the natural cues that elicit feeding, egg-laying or reproductive behaviours in target insects. The novelty of this proposal lies in our idea of developing insect control agents that are not toxic but that prevent the crop/forest-damaging behaviour. We anticipate that such compounds will become important tools in integrated pest management schemes.

"One hundred million year old Cretaceous rocks beneath the Plains of western Canada are globally-significant because they provide one of the most complete records of Cretaceous climate and sea-level change.  Abundant records from oil and gas boreholes allow us to map rock layers in great detail, reconstructing ancient shorelines, rivers, deltas and flood- plains.  One of the most interesting results coming from our mapping is 

that sea-level oscillated up and down by perhaps 5-20 m on time-scales of about 20,000 to 100,000 yrs.  Such changes are most logically attributed to the growth and melting of modest ice-caps on the Antarctic continent. This however is contrary to the >Cretaceous Greenhouse= model of an equable, ice-free world with very high atmospheric CO2 levels. Our results from western Canada have led us to collaborate with scientists in Canada, the UK, US, Czech Republic and Poland to study paleoclimate, high-precision radiometric dating,  biostratigraphic and sequence-stratigraphic correlation in an attempt to demonstrate that sea-level changes observed in Canada are of global extent, - proof of which would greatly strengthen the argument for waxing and waning Antarctic ice caps, and cause serious re-thinking of the nature of the 'Cretaceous Greenhouse'.

networks, rheology of complex fluids and gels and molecular motors. In the area of elasticity, we

have been studying how the elastic constants vanish as the network becomes sparse enough that it approaches the point at which connectivity is lost (percolation). In the other half of the

phase diagram, the opposite effect is of interest: As particles are linked to each to a greater and

greater degree, the fluid phase becomes more viscous and, eventually a gel or amorphous

solid. We are interested in the nature of that transition and the extent to which its characteristics are universal. Finally, we are working with a group of experimentalists who are

trying to make artificial molecular motors. We are using simulations to help optimize the design.","Advancement of knowledge","Simon Fraser University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Physique de la mati�re condens�e","Physique de la mati�re condens�e"

"In this proposal, we investigate fundamental phenomena in biology from the viewpoint of physics, using analytical and computational tools. We are interested primarily in 3 research areas. One is in biologically inspired optimization problems. Often evolution seeks to optimize the fitness of an organism by modifying shape, motion, or molecules. In some cases such optimization may be understood mathematically, in others, through computer algorithms. We focus specifically on a problem important to understanding how a protein folds to its biologically functional structure, which involves generalizing the notion of distance, normally taken between points, to objects of higher dimension. Another optimization problem is related to phylogenetic trees, the tree of life, and involves the construction of high-dimensional networks of minimal length indicating how closely related living species are, as well as what their common ancestors may have looked like. We are interested in constructing such networks and understanding their universal properties.

     The second research area is related to how biomolecules move around through small holes or pores which perforate membranes compartmentalizing the cell. Interestingly, a controlled study where a single stand of DNA threads through a single nanopore may be a potential tool allowing DNA to be sequenced, by analyzing current signals and translocation times. Computer models of DNA must be simplified to study these phenomena so simulations can run in reasonable time. This will involve modeling DNA as a sequence of ellipsoids, the dynamics of which are best described through hyper-complex numbers called quaternions. This framework avoids the problem of pathological divergences in energy that arise in traditional approaches.

     The third research area addresses why almost everyone has their heart on their left hand side, and liver on their right. This deep and unresolved problem stems back to the fact that life uses only left-handed amino acids to make proteins. We plan to investigate the initial symmetry-breaking events that occur around day 8 in vertebrate development, and their subsequent amplification into macroscopic left-right asymmetry.

"While advanced ceramics and their composites have been prepared from powders for many decades, there is now a growing interest in producing metallic components from powder sources. This approach offers the benefit of near-net shape production and reduced material wastage, when compared to more conventional metal forming routes such as casting. The processing of advanced particulate materials requires that the powders are initially consolidated into the desired shape, prior to final densification by sintering. Occasionally this can be achieved through simple uniaxial compression, especially for selected metallic alloys such as aluminium and steels (using pressures up to 600 MPa), and when the particle sizes are moderately coarse (i.e. > 40 microns). However, for metals such as magnesium and titanium, which can deform by twinning, die binding becomes a serious problem even at moderate uniaxial pressures (i.e. > 100 MPa). In addition, the use of fine metallic powders (i.e. < 20 microns) is simply not feasible, even though such powders would have potentially greater 'sinterability'. Similarly, for micron or sub-micron sized ceramic powders it is generally necessary to use high pressure isostatic compaction. Uniaxially pressed ceramic preforms do not have sufficient green strength or density, as they invariably cannot be pressed at pressures above ~50 MPa, as die binding and wear can arise. These problems can be alleviated by cold isostatic pressing (CIP), especially when following low pressure uniaxial pressing. The present proposal requests the provision of funding for a CIP system, capable of pressures up to 689 MPa, which will be used for alloys based on aluminium, magnesium, nickel and titanium, as well as for advanced structural ceramics, such as silicon nitride and titanium carbide. The CIP will allow production of novel, ceramic-reinforced metal matrix composites, where fine particle sizes can be used to promote microstructural homogeneity. An atmosphere controlled glove-box is also available, so that more reactive metal powders can be pressed without exposure to an oxidising atmosphere, which is a major problem for finer particle sizes. Finally, precision CNC milling facilities are available for further shaping of CIPed preforms.

"Ceramic-metal composites, or cermets, are widely used in the oil and gas, chemical processing, and manufacturing industries, due to a combination of high resistance to wear and corrosion, combined with excellent toughness and damage tolerance. Two novel cermet systems will be developed and evaluated in the present study, building on the previous work of the primary applicant (Dr. Plucknett). Current cermet systems such as tungsten carbide/cobalt suffer from a number of performance limitations, notably poor corrosion resistance, severe strength degradation at elevated temperatures and high mass. The new cermet systems are based on the use of ductile nickel aluminides or stainless steels as the metallic binder phase, with titanium carbonitride and titanium carbide as the respective ceramic phases. The materials that are to be developed will be characterised in terms of their mechanical properties, together with their wear and corrosion resistance, and compared to current state of the art cermets. Composite development will be based upon the use of colloidal forming methods to produce the ceramic preforms, building on our current work in this area. Cermet densification can then be achieved by infiltration of the molten binder alloy (or melt). Colloidal forming allows techniques such as gel casting to be employed, allowing the production of complex shaped components. Subsequent green machining is then possible, prior to melt-infiltration, giving the possibility of net-shape component production. In particular, these new materials are aimed at potential application in the demanding environments of the Canadian oil and gas industry, which combines the need for both wear and corrosion resistant materials. The proposed research will support up to seven HQP at Dalhousie University, with clear potential for intellectual property development.

"Ceramic-metal composites (or cermets) combine the favourable mechanical properties of both constituents, namely the high hardness and wear resistance of ceramics and the ductility and toughness associated with metals. Consequently, cermets are used in diverse applications including: transportation (marine, automotive, aerospace), chemical processing, pulp and paper processing, waste incineration, etc.. For many decades tungsten carbide/cobalt 'hardmetals' (WC/Co) have been the primary example of industrially applied cermets. However, these materials are limited in application by their poor resistance to corrosion and high temperature oxidation (i.e. above ~500�C), as well as their susceptibility to high temperature strength degradation. Recently, a new generation of advanced cermets, based on either carbide or boride ceramics combined with ductile nickel or iron aluminides, has been developed in work conducted by the applicant. In particular, titanium carbide/nickel aluminide (TiC/Ni3Al) cermets exhibit generally similar mechanical properties to WC/Co at room temperature, but vastly superior elevated temperature behaviour. For example, it has been demonstrated that TiC/Ni3Al cermets are actually stronger at 1000�C than at room temperature, while they also have less than half the mass of WC/Co. In the proposed work, novel variants of these materials will be developed, based on alloyed titanium carbonitride (Ti(C,N)) matrices, as well as nano-structured TiC matrices. Fundamental studies of the wetting and melt-infiltration behaviour will be conducted to assess processing parameters. The contact fatigue response of the composites will be determined under Hertzian indentation loading conditions, at both room and elevated temperature. A novel method based on focused ion beam excision of the indented regions will be developed to assess elastic/plastic deformation. The oxidation behaviour will be determined using thermogravimetric analysis and microstructural characterisation. In addition, novel binders will be evaluated, with a preliminary screening conducted using sputtering based combinatorial search methods, combined with nano-indentation of the resulting libraries.

"The objectives of my research program are 1) to contribute to an improved understanding of fire activity under climate change and fire suppression, 2) to contribute to improved decision-making for sustainable development in forest management. 



Climate Change and Area Burned by Forest Fires



In previous research I discovered that fire growth models predict fire growth during intense growth periods, or 'spread events', accurately, and developed a model for spread events. I will develop a model for fire extinguishment and incorporate my models into fire growth modeling. This will improve the accuracy and scope of our fire growth modeling. I will also develop a simulation model to predict area burned on the national scale.



Sustainable Forest Management under Climate Change 



I propose to study forest management under a changing climate. I propose to link these ideas of forest management under uncertainty and valuation of forest resources to recent work on forest management for carbon sequestration. I will begin with an optimal rotation problem under risk of fire, in which the forest manager has the option of hedging against fire risk by purchasing carbon credits on a CO2 market. I will also develop a simulation model of Toronto's urban forest to help urban forest managers decide how to modify their planting program for a changing climate.

"Patterned magnetic materials have become the optimal choice for the next generation of data storage in both computer hard disks and random access memory (RAM) devices. A variety of techniques are being explored within the industry to optimize their performance and effectiveness. This opportunity to develop new methods to fabricate these materials has catalyzed an active and growing collaboration at Memorial University that draws from expertise in three distinct areas: electrochemical production of materials, self-assembly of patterned materials, and computer simulations of magnetic material properties. We have demonstrated a promising new avenue for preparing patterned magnetic materials by pairing exceptionally fast and economical materials synthesis techniques. The resulting patterned materials exhibit complex shapes, and we propose that they may offer advantages for retaining high integrity data storage even as device dimensions shrink. 

     The most important step linking our materials synthesis with data storage applications is magnetic response characterization. For this, we require new research instrumentation: a vibrating sample magnetometer. When coupled with micromagnetics simulations, this tool will enable us to establish and understand important relationships between our new fabrication technique and magnetic device performance. These findings will be important to those in the fields of physics and engineering, and improved magnetic data storage devices will benefit consumers as well as the communications and computing industries in Canada and abroad.","Electrical and electronic machinery and equipment (including computer hardware)","Memorial University of Newfoundland",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","Propri�t�s magn�tiques et mat�riaux magn�tiques","Physique de la mati�re condens�e"
"Much like people, solid materials are never perfect. Also like people, the imperfections in a solid often define their character and make them unique. In fact, there are materials whose current scientific and technological appeal is intimately related to the types of defects and impurities that they can accommodate. For example, zinc oxide is a leading candidate for use in the transparent transistors that could enable brighter, more energy-efficient laptop computer displays. However, optimizing the performance of zinc oxide has challenged scientists because of the kinds of imperfections that occur naturally within this material. The defect-sensitive properties of materials like zinc oxide present an urgent need - as well as a golden opportunity - for strategies to control and tailor the creation of technological materials.     

     Addressing this need, my research program explores the role that defects play in tailoring the growth and performance of zinc oxide and other materials of technological interest. My experiments utilize a powerful combination of leading-edge material characterization techniques to assess the order (crystallinity) and disorder (defects) in selected materials prepared by electrochemical methods. This includes materials with applications for magnetics, optics, and biocompatible coatings. My long-term goal is to develop more general and versatile strategies for controlling imperfections to create economical, higher performance thin film materials.   

    This research program will produce highly qualified personnel whose skills in material synthesis and characterization are highly sought in the industrial and technology sectors, both within Canada and abroad. These skilled professionals will be able to utilize and develop novel instrumentation and techniques to advance the development of technological materials.

"Most employees utilize computers in their duties.  The software systems with which these users accomplish their tasks can often be improved to provide only the information that is needed, at the appropriate time, with a minimum of effort.  Employing the computer and its software to facilitate these operations for the user is termed an Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS).  While most EPSS can be readily customized to suit an individual (for instance, font enlargement in a web browser) the ability of the EPSS itself to adapt to the corporate information sources when changes occur, is very poor - usually requiring the installation of a new software information management system and all the disruption which that entails.  Companies are very aware of the notion of change management.  Previous research done here has illustrated the viability of an adaptable EPSS and this proposal continues this work with application to the area of medical informatics and more specifically the ever-changing individual electronic health record, within which, there are many disparate knowledge sources that are not compatible, such as MR/CT images and their analyses, physician's clinical test results, and so on.  The main property of the EPSS is to dispense information to the individual to allow self-assessments and better provide data involved in critical decision-making situations.  To do this, the EPSS must translate knowledge of many types into a form that is useful for the individual; that is, we must accommodate the many different types of information in some form of software.  Because the EPSS is based on software agents, the addition of a new knowledge source only requires the creation of a new software agent.  Adding the agent does not require the software to be stopped or reissued in any manner.  Much like adding expertise to a corporation by hiring experts that will provide a new corporate capability, the EPSS can dynamically accommodate the need to expand its knowledge bases without the need to stop or update the system off-line.  Finally, migrating the EPSS to the WWW would produce a very powerful medical patient portal facility.

"Ultrasound has the potential, by combining and further developing various techniques, to become a single integrated biomedical tool for examining anatomical structure, tissue pathology, and fluid dynamics, as well as functional imaging and targeted therapy (via tissue-specific microbubbles). While this may also be true for some other diagnostic modalities, ultrasound has the added advantages of being fast, compact, portable, and relatively inexpensive. This in turn has made it a prime candidate for advancing the knowledge of various disease processes via longitudinal studies to monitor disease progression. 

     The proposed research is aimed at the development of Doppler ultrasound techniques for investigating flow associated with sites of atherosclerotic vascular disease, such as the carotid artery bifurcation, in order to reveal more in-depth information on the local flow patterns, such as recirculation and turbulence, which are important factors in atherosclerotic vascular disease.

     Atherosclerosis is a thickening or hardening of artery walls to form plaques that can lead to emboli (particles) in the bloodstream. These emboli subsequently can become lodged in small arteries causing a blockage in blood flow in the brain, known as an ischemic stroke, or in the heart, known as a heart attack. It is recognized that hemodynamics play a role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, but a better understanding is needed of the clinically significant flow characteristics and how these may be identified through different DUS spectral parameters in order to better monitor in vivo hemodynamics and correlate blood-flow data with tissue disease changes. 

     The proposed basic investigations of the underlying physics of blood flow in diseased vessels in a controlled environment represent a significant step towards realizing the full potential of current Doppler ultrasound techniques for understanding and diagnosing vessel disease.

"Cosmological observations favor a universe with two periods of accelerated expansion in its history. One, known as Inflation, is thought to have happened in the distant past and helps explain the observed large scale features of the universe. The other period of acceleration is ongoing and, according to our current model, requires 70% of the universe density to be in the form of Dark Energy.  Both phenomena are still lacking a satisfactory description in terms of a fundamental theory.  The proposed research will contribute to developing models of Inflation and Dark Energy and ways of testing them with observations. It will help train students in a rapidly developing field, and further strengthen Canada's position as a leader in fundamental research. 



The Brane Inflation scenario is a working example of how inflation can be realized within the framework of String Theory -- a leading candidate for a fundamental theory of all particle interactions. What may help to distinguish Brane Inflation from other inflationary models is the special type of cosmic strings that form in brane-anti-brane collisions. I will study the non-trivial properties of these string networks and identify their observable features, such as the signatures they would induce in the cosmic microwave background radiation.



The cosmic acceleration could be caused by some type of repulsive Dark Energy or be a manifestation of Gravity obeying different laws on largest scales. My work will include developing tests of Dark Energy that will maximally utilize the information contained in the data. I will also study some of the interesting models of modified gravity with the focus on their predictions for the clustering of cosmic matter. Future telescopes will be able to track the evolution of cosmic structures back in time. My research involves understanding the capabilities of planned and proposed observations and making detailed forecasts of the extent to which they will help us be distinguish between different theories.

"Movement of proteins and organelles within a cell is a well-regulated process involving many molecular interactions. We discovered several proteins that are involved in this movement process. We recently found a novel interaction between two proteins in lymphocytes. These proteins are involved in moving vesicles to the area of the lymphocyte that is in contact with tumour cells. We will attempt to isolate other proteins that bind these proteins and determine how they are involved in movement of vesicles in lymphocytes. One protein is also cleaved when the cells potentially commit suicide. We would like to determine if this mechanism is used to kill and remove infected lymphocytes.  Another structurally related protein to our protein was also found in nerve cells. Recently we have found it to be also expressed in lymphocytes. This protein may have different lengths.  We will determine if these similar proteins can substitute for each other. The roles of these proteins in moving vesicles to the immune synapse and also their role in cell motility will be explored. Our long term goals are to determine how these proteins participate in coordinating vesicular traffic based upon our novel model.

"Over the past ten years, our team has documented an elegant mechanism by which the injured adult brain uses the cholesterol and phospholipids released from dead or dying cells to feed surviving neurons which are in the process of rebuilding new synaptic networks, in an attempt to alleviate the lost or damaged inputs. Cell studies have shown that the cholesterol produced intracellularly is transported by a series of complexes called the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) complexes. The ABC transporters are membrane proteins that transport a wide variety of substrates intracellularly and across membranes. The ABCA and ABCG subclasses in particular are involved in the transport of phospholipids and/or cholesterol across the plasma membrane, and mutations in several of these genes are associated with dysregulated lipid and sterol homeostasis. Because both ABCA1 and ABCG1 are expressed in brain, a key determinant of the lipoprotein population in CNS is likely to be the lipidation of apoE (synthesized by glia) and apoAI (derived from plasma) mediated by one or both of these transporters. 



OBJECTIVE: We propose to carefully dissect the molecular cascade regulating the cholesterol metabolism by examining step by step i) the intracellular transport of cholesterol by the ABC transporters system in glial cells both vitro and in the injured adult brain using normal mice and genetically modified mice who cannot express these ABCs in their brain, ii) the assembly of apoE-containing lipoprotein complex in presence/absence of genetic and pharmacological modulator of ABC complexes formation and, iii) the binding and internalization of the apoE-lipoprotoein complexes via specific receptor expressed by neurons actively involved in synaptic and terminal remodeling .



OUTCOME: We believe that these studies will provide crucial insights as to the cascade of molecular event leading to the activation of synaptic repair and the delivery of key lipid precursors involved in brain repair mechanisms in the adult and aging brain eventually.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","McGill University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Neurophysiologie,"Biologie animale"
"Materials whose physical properties are dominated by particle-particle interactions are called strongly correlated. These interactions produce novel ground states at low temperatures among which superconductivity and magnetism are the most important. The competition, the coexistence and the interrelation between these states must be investigated experimentally to appreciate their potential in future devices. Among these materials, organic conductors with a low-dimensional character are particularly attractive because an unconventional superconducting state is in competition with magnetism. They are also considered as ideal systems because of energy scales (temperature, pressure, magnetic field) attainable in laboratories. Superconducting thin films which can be more easily incorporated in novel devices and magnetic materials showing simultaneously magnetism and electric polarization (multiferroics) will also be studied. We propose to perform ultrasonic and microwave experiments on these systems to address important issues related to the identification and characterization of the novel superconducting and/or magnetic states. Such experiments are essential to sustain the construction of theoretical models of these materials. These experiments will be performed as a function of temperature (low 2-300 K and ultra-low 20 mK), of magnetic field (18 Tesla as a function of orientation) and hydrostatic pressure (12 kbar). These measurements can potentially constitute key experiments to complete our understanding of the materials.

"The proposed research draws on four inter-related areas:

Chemistry: Reaction mechanisms, both in gas phase and in solution, are studied using high levels of theory.  A long-term goal is to design and develop simple models to help chemists to a priori predict and explain reactivity and selectivity.

Algorithms: The long-term aim is to develop highly optimized algorithms for all aspects of computational chemistry. Special consideration is given to algorithms that can take advantage of modern computer architectures, e.g., parallel processing.

Theory: Novel wavefunction theories are being developed which can account for electron correlation and that lend themselves well to Divide-and-Conquer methods and to parallel processing.  In addition, a Simulated Electronic Structure Theory, a completely novel approach to performing empirical calculations, is being developed.  With this theory it is possible to simulate ab initio calculations and unlike conventional molecular mechanics, correctly describe bond dissociation and may ultimately be able to describe the entire potential energy surface.  These are ambitious undertakings that have the potential to revolutionize computational chemistry.

Chemical Informatics: Enormous amounts of chemical information are generated by computational methods, e.g., structures, heats of reaction, including complete reaction pathways.  We are developing metrics that can easily and efficiently be used for chemical information retrieval, sub-structure searches, similarity measures, and for complex queries.  A web-based National Comprehensive Computational Chemistry DataBase will be created, along with the tools for chemical information retrieval and storage.  Such a resource will be of tremendous benefit to researchers in academia and industry, especially the pharmaceutical industry.

"The proposal is divided into two broad streams. The first stream is concerned with the physics of black holes in tidal environments. What happens to a black hole when it is not isolated, but placed in the presence of other bodies which exert tidal forces on it? To answer this question requires a description of the tidal environment, a computation of the gravitational perturbation created by the external bodies, and the extraction of physical, measurable consequences. Among the most exciting of those consequences is the prospect of measuring the effect of the tidal coupling in gravitational waves, a measurement that would allow a black hole to be observationally distinguished from other types of compact bodies. I have initiated this line of investigation in 2004, and I propose to extend it in many different directions during the next granting cycle. 



The second stream is concerned with the motion of a small-mass body around a large black hole, in a treatment that goes beyond the test-mass description. In this treatment, the small mass creates a (small but significant) perturbation in the gravitational field of the large black hole. The perturbation affects the motion of the small body --- the motion is no longer geodesic, but accelerated, and the body is said to move in response to its own gravitational self-force. The perturbation also propagates outward in the form of gravitational waves. What is the nature of the self-forced motion, and what information concerning the strong-field dynamics can be extracted from the gravitational waves? These are the questions that my research group and I have been asking. This line of investigation was started before the current granting cycle, and our progress has been steady. It will be pursued vigourously during the next granting cycle.

"This proposal addresses modelling of failure of polyethylene (PE) in the context of the applicability of this material for the construction industry.  Long term performance of PE is likely the most critical issue that needs to be addressed in order to safely use PE and similar polymers as construction materials. Long term performance and failure (slow crack growth, creep rupture or yield) of PE are directly related to its environmental stress crack resistance (ESCR), which is determined in laboratory conditions. However, the relationship between ESCR and the structural performance of polyethylene in real conditions is not well understood. 

The proposed research will involve: 1) analysis and evaluation of ESCR testing methods in terms of the physical phenomena influencing each type of test, 2) determination of rational failure criteria based on ESCR test results and molecular structure of PE, 3) implementation of these failure criteria into macromechanical time-dependent constitutive formulations, and 4) implementation of the constitutive formulations into finite element analysis procedures. The study will be done by examining mechanics of creep, plastic deformations and failure on the molecular, micro-mechanical and macro-mechanical levels.  The relationship between micro- and macro-levels will be established.  The objectives will be realized by a comprehensive research program, which will include laboratory testing (both chemical and mechanical) as well as the development of theoretical mechanical modelling for polymeric materials.  

The proposed research project is part of a larger research initiative carried out at the University of Waterloo that focuses on linking chemical and mechanical properties of polymers.  The goals are developing rational constitutive formulations, necessary for practical utilization of polymers in structures and specifying appropriate manufacturing and molding processes when the required (desired) mechanical properties are known, allowing to produce improved materials for specific applications.

"This Strategic Project is directed toward the development of a method for the controlled imprinting of stable molecular-scale patterns on silicon surfaces. The method is embodied in four international patents (three issued, one pending) awarded to this laboratory. At this ultimate nano-scale of miniaturization neither masks nor manual manipulation are practical, instead, the 'ink' that embodies the pattern must be self-assembled. Accordingly, part I of this project seeks novel means for the patterned self-assembly of physisorbed (i.e., loosely attached) inks on silicon. Part II addresses the subsequent problem of permanently attaching these mobile molecular-scale patterns or their reaction-products to the underlying surface by means of 'localized' chemical reactions, induced by heat, light or electrons. Parts I and II taken together constitute a novel 'printing press' for nano-patterning, a fundamental step toward the realization and manufacture of nano-circuitry.","Physical sciences","University of Toronto",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Chimie des surfaces et des interfaces","Chimie physique"

"This research seeks to exploit a new opportunity to obtain detailed understanding of the way in which simple chemical processes take place at surfaces.  The opportunity stems from the confluence of two fields of contemporary research:  Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and Reaction Dynamics.  STM allows the experimenter to obtain images of single molecules at surfaces.  Reaction Dynamics (a field pioneered by the applicant with others) is the study of the molecular motions that give rise to chemical reaction.  A combination of these two fields offers a unique opportunity to see individual reagent molecules at surfaces and, following activation by heat, light or electrons, to correlate their geometries with subsequent product geometries.  Stated briefly, the opportunity exists to map the molecular motions in the course of surface reactions, a-molecule-at-a-time.  

This has a clear practical purpose since progress in fabricating nano-structures will depend on our knowledge of, and hence our ability to control, the locations and bonding of reaction products at surfaces.  A powerful new means to pattern surfaces is (a) to decorate them with loosely-bound self-assembled molecules and then (b) to induce localized reaction to imprint the self-assembled patterns, unaltered, permanently on the surface (this constitutes 'Molecular-Scale Imprinting', MSI, being developed in this laboratory).  Accordingly, we propose to engage in systematic studies of reaction dynamics in photon- and electron-induced reaction, and also thermal reaction, of physisorbed self-assembled patterns of molecules when engaged in chemical binding with underlying semi-conductor or metal surfaces.

The research will be experimental, supported by theory.  In favourable cases we can hope to see the reagent molecules (pattern and location), the underlying surface atoms, and the location at the surface of the reaction products -- a rich lode of information for use in surface science and allied technology.

"The petrogenetic and geodynamic models proposed to explain the origin of Archean anorthosite-greenstone associations require re-evaluation within the context of new high-precision geochemical data. Over the next five years, I plan to conduct a comprehensive series of field, trace element (e.g., LILE, REE, HFSE, transition metals) and radiogenic isotopic (e.g., Nd, Hf, Pb) studies on the well-preserved Neoarchean Fiskenaesset (SW Greenland), Bad Vermilion Lake (Ontario, Canada) and Dor� Lake (Quebec, Canada) layered anorthosite complexes and spatially associated greenstone belts. The overarching objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of the petrogenesis and geodynamic setting of this distinctive Archean magmatic associations. The specific outstanding problems to be addressed by the project are: (1) what are the sources of anorthositic magmas? (2) What are the petrogenetic relationships between anorthosites and associated gabbros, ultramafic intrusions, and mafic to felsic volcanic rocks? (3) What are the geodynamic settings in which these rocks formed? The results of this project will have the following significance: (1) enhance our knowledge on the petrogenetic origin of Archean anorthosites; and (2) improve our understanding the geodynamic origin of Archean greenstone belts and continental crust. Canadian mining industry will benefit from this study given that anorthosites complexes often contain mineral deposits (e.g. chromites). The project will provide important opportunities for two PhD students in the University of Windsor. One of the students will work on the Fiskenaesset Complex and the other student will study the Dor� Lake and Bad Vermilion Lake anorthosite complexes and associated volcanic rocks.

"This proposal describes ways to prepare and study how taking dye molecules, or 'chromophores' that are ordinarily flat, and bending them into curved structures.  This is interesting because we think it should offer a different way to tune the properties of these molecules, which then in the long term may help materials scientists use them for commercial applications.   

As is often the case in research in the physical sciences, we gained our initial source of inspiration from nature.  Impressive examples of how nature bends chromophores can be found in photosynthesis, wherein several of the molecules that mediate the transfer of the light energy are bent. It is believed the curvature helps to tune the properties of the molecules to make the process more efficient.  Chemists have made bent molecules before as well, though making them can be challenging because the molecules would rather be planar.  Nevertheless, in the few cases where chemists have made bent molecules that allow a fair comparison with their planar cousins, they have found that new and interesting properties emerge; including how they absorb and give off (fluoresce) light, and how they behave in an electric field (to name a few).

As our subjects of study, we have chosen to explore ways to prepare curved derivatives two important chromophores, porphyrins and pentacenes.  We intend to distort the porphyrins into a bowl-shape, the only type of deformation that neither nature nor chemists have explored.  We also make bent, 'banana' shaped versions of the board-shaped pentacene molecules. We chose these two classes because they are emerging as very important materials for a use in electronics that use organic materials instead of metals, as well as photovoltaic devices.  It is anticipated that so-called 'organic electronics' may prove to be an extremely important technology in constructing future electronic devices in the future, including computers and inexpensive solar cells.

"The far North represents one of the most challenging research environments in Canada, not only does it's natural systems behave differently than elsewhere, but the obstacles to Arctic fieldwork (both scientific and logistical) are enormous. The Arctic is also one of the most important global systems driving ocean and atmospheric circulation. It is also widely recognised as ""the canary in the coal mine"" for global climate change.  There are recent indications that Arctic climates are changing faster than predicted only a few years ago. Extreme environments like the Arctic provide important clues in our understanding about the limits of physical and biological processes on Earth. Lessons learned in Earth's Polar Regions are being used to develop a better understanding of neighboring planets like Mars.

My research focuses on two important aspects of the northern science. First, the dynamic interaction between extreme cold and biophysical systems, in particular the impact of cold temperature and permafrost on the hydrologic and microbiologic character of perennial springs. And secondly, the potential impacts of climate change on permafrost landscapes and infrastructure. My research employs detailed measurement, sampling and modelling in a series of northern locations to better understand the coupling of surface and groundwater hydrology, the surface exchange of energy, water and chemical mass, and microbial processes that together control the dynamics of physical and biochemical systems of permafrost and cold polar deserts. It also seeks to explain the dynamic interaction between frozen ground and climate, the formation and degradation of surface and subsurface ice in response to changing climates. This research addresses some of NSERC targeted areas by investigating Arctic global change, Earth system evolution and focusing on topics that play a major role in the sustainable management of northern resources. The North and climate change are also identified as priorities in NSERC's re-allocation recommendations.

"Geometry and dynamics on Riemannian manifolds are closely linked to the properties of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator. In this proposal I focus on two topics: dynamical aspects of spectral asymptotics and geometric inequalities for eigenvalues. The first topic is of particular importance from the quantum mechanical viewpoint. According to Bohr's correspondence principle, the spectral data at high energies ``feels'' the geodesic flow. My research program contributes to the mathematical understanding of this principle, particularly through the study of quantum ergodicity and of the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues. The second topic is mostly concerned with the opposite - low - part of the spectrum.  Geometric inequalities for small eigenvalues are  of great importance in the study of sound propagation and heat diffusion, and they have attracted attention of mathematicians and physicists since the time of Lord Rayleigh. I discuss some ways to obtain new sharp eigenvalue inequalities on surfaces and planar domains, and to study the corresponding extremal geometries. I also indicate intriguing connections between this rather classical subject and spectral theory of the Dirac operator, which is a recently developed area of geometric analysis.

"Snowmelt is the most significant contribution to water resources in most of Canada and so is not only vital to Canada's water security, but forms the basis for many impacts of climate change on Canadian ecosystems, communities and economies.  It is changing rapidly in the mountains, prairies and north due to climate and land use change.  Models of snowcover are used in many hydrological, meteorological and ecological applications.  Snow processes have been identified as an area of continuing weakness in models.  The long-term objective of this research is to reduce uncertainty in describing and predicting snow hydrology by improving the fundamental understanding of snow. The specific objectives of this research are to: 1) Improve the understanding of snowfall and energy inputs to snow, 2) Improve the understanding of snowmelt and meltwater release, 3) Better describe snow-vegetation interactions.  The approach will combine innovative field observation programmes in the Mountains, North and Prairies with laboratory advances in observational techniques and mathematical simulations of the fundamental snow hydrology processes.  The field programme, observational technique advance and computer modelling will contribute to all three objectives through common sites and suite of computational platforms. The field observation programme will use established research basins (high elevation -Marmot Creek, Alberta; high latitude - Wolf Creek, Yukon; prairie/woodland - Smith Creek, Saskatchewan) to supplement baseline measurements with detailed physical measurements.  Observational advances will focus primarily on the use of sound waves in snow to determine the internal structure and wetness of the snowpack. New models will be evaluated in the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform (CRHM) to determine the degree to which soil moisture and streamflow predictions in cold regions are improved by improved model physical process descriptions.

"This proposal consists of two items which plans to make use of noncommutative geometry in various geometric contexts. 



- Item #1: Noncommutative geometry, CR geometry and Fefferman's program. The general aim of this item  to make use of noncommutative geometry and of pseudodifferential techniques to relate the hypoelliptic analysis of the Kohn-Rossi complex to the CR differential geometry of the underlying manifold. It consists of 3 projects. The first project aims to reformulate the local index formula in CR geometry, the second one plans to give a geometric expression for the Euler characteristic of the Kohn-Rossi complex and the last one concerns applications to Fefferman's program in CR geometry. 



- Item #3: Higher index formula in noncommutative geometry and the quantum Hall effect. This item aims to prove ``higher'' versions of the local index formula in noncommutative geometry of Connes-Moscovici. This is partly motivated by a joint project with Mathai Varghese about the quantum Hall effect.

"Design Optimization Under Uncertainty

Design optimization of engineering and economic systems under uncertainty (probability and fuzzy types of

uncertainties) is a challenging problem. Modelling and design of real-world engineering problems have

become more complicated due to globalization resulting in severe competition, small marginal benefits albeit

potentially a large market, interrelated markets, instant capital flows, environmental degradation, conflicts, and

sustainability issues. Such design problems exist in many fields requiring multi faceted problem solving skills;

such fields are: water resources, pollution control, manufacturing, energy, electronic communication, financial

engineering, supply chain management, and health care, among others.



Large-scale design optimization under uncertainty has received new impetus from the introduction of copula

based models to treat commonly encountered dependent-non-normal-stochastic uncertainty, soft computing

tools for treating fuzzy uncertainty, and new techniques in non-smooth, non-differentiable, and global

optimization and massive distributed computing to efficiently solve these problems. However, each of the

above-mentioned engineering application requires specialized fine-tuning to fit the problem. The objective of

this proposal is to further develop our proven ability to apply new design optimization techniques to such

problems of significant economic and environmental importance.

"Gas hydrates are being evaluated for their potential as a future energy source.  To facilitate this evaluation, a few numerical reservoir simulators have been developed over the past decade.  These models are quite comprehensive and include the important mechanisms of multi-phase flow, convection and conduction, as well as intrinsic kinetics of hydrate decomposition.  Currently, three of these simulators, one of which has been developed in our group, are being used to evaluate the feasibility of suggested production methods.  This simulator will be enhanced as part of the research proposed here.

Based on recent mechanistic studies using our hydrate simulators, we have identified a number of approximations which do not affect calculation of the gas-production rate from a hydrate reservoir that includes free gas at the bottom and a hydrate cap at top.  In such a reservoir, hydrates at top contribute to the produced gas once the reservoir pressure is reduced by gas production from the free-gas zone.  Large gas reservoirs of this type are known in Alaska and are believed to exist in the Mackenzie Delta of the Northwest Territories, Canada and.  Currently, planning for these reservoirs does not include the effect of additional gas generated by the decomposition of the gas hydrate.

In this project, we invoke the above approximations and develop simple models to calculate the rate of gas production including that from the hydrates.   We will conduct extensive sensitivity studies using our comprehensive numerical simulator to examine the range of applicability of these simplified solutions, and to evaluate the impact of the hydrate on top of the gas reservoirs on productivity and life span of these reservoirs.

Furthermore, the analytical solutions will be inverted, to develop methods for interpretation of tests performed on hydrate reservoirs, for determination of the in-situ properties of the hydrate reservoir.  Similar objectives are sought for the thermal stimulation technique.  As part of the research program proposed here, ""equivalent"" hydrate decomposition reaction parameters will be determined that are suitable for field-scale simulation.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","University of Calgary",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie chimique","G�nie chimique"

"The globalization of the metals industry is resulting in extreme competitive pressures on the Canadian metals sector. As a result, there is increased awareness by Canadian companies such as Alcan that they must focus on high valued added products. The current proposal is a collaboration between Alcan and UBC to address this need. This project examines extrusion of 3xxx aluminum alloys which are used in a variety of applications but are of particular significance for the manufacture of heat exchangers used in the transportation sector. Currently, there is very limited knowledge in the literature about the processing of these alloys, especially in comparison to traditional aluminum extrusion alloys. The primary objective of this work is to develop knowledge based models for this process which will aid industry in improving the properties and quality of these alloys. The approach taken will be a combination of focused experiments and state of the art modelling techniques. The scope of the work will start with industrially produced as-cast alloys and then encompass the following aspects of the process: homogenization of the alloys, hot extrusion, room temperature deformation and final annealing. The benefits to Canada include i) the development and transfer of specific knowledge to the industrial partner, Alcan, ii) the education of 4 graduate students (2 MASc, 2 PhD), one research associate and one research engineer (the need for HQP has been identified by the industry) and iii) the expansion of internationally leading expertise on the physical metallurgy of aluminum alloys at UBC.","Manufacturing processes and products","University of British Columbia",3,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Structure, propri�t�s et essais des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"

"There is an increasing demand for new and improved metals and alloys for use in the transportation sector. The driver for this demand is the need to reduce fuel consumption and the associated reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. For example, light weighting of automobiles has been identified as one of the most effective ways to reduce the environmental impact of these vehicles. The general rule of thumb is that a 10% reduction in the weight of a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle reduces fuel consumption/emissions by 5-7%. Further, light weighting of vehicles is considered an enabling technology for the next generation of electric, fuel cell or plug-in hybrid vehicles. The most effective approach to reducing vehicle weight, while maintaining the performance that customers demand, is to use new materials. The substitution of the light metals, aluminum or magnesium, for steel has the potential to reduce component weight by 66 and 80 %, respectively.



The challenge for the increased utilization of light metals is that these materials intrinsically are more difficult to process than the better understood steels that they will replace. The objective of the applicant's research program is to develop basic understanding of the strength and fracture of light metals. Specifically, the following topics will be examined: i) the mechanism of atomic clustering of solute atoms in Al-Mg-Si alloys will be studied using a combination of novel mechanical tests and atom probe microscopy, ii) a new approach will be taken to designing aluminum alloys with multiple sets of different precipitates and iii) the underlying fracture mechanisms in magnesium sheet alloys will be elucidated using real time monitoring of damage during deformation with x-ray tomography. These projects will lead to the training of Ph.D. students who are in high demand from industry, academe and government laboratories.

"Lasers have completely changed many fields of science and our everyday life since their invention.  They have transformed our understanding of atoms and molecules as well as the way we communicate with each other and store information.  Today, lasers have become ubiquitous and can be found in every bar-code scanner and CD and DVD player. Meanwhile, the field of laser devices and their physics has continued to evolve and grow with many scientific and technological developments.  In the past decade or so, the field of laser and photonic devices has taken a new leap forward with advances in fabrication technologies and material science.  Today, features of the order of nanometers in size can be readily fabricated, which opens new opportunities to study the interaction of photons and electrons in micro- and nano-scale structures.



Using this unprecedented level of control over the physical properties of micro- and nano-scale devices, we will study theoretically and experimentally the dynamical (i.e. time dependent) and noise (i.e. fluctuation) behaviour of optical microresonators and microresonator lasers.  In the same way that a drum head or a tuning fork is a resonator for acoustic waves, optical microresonators are chip-scale resonators for light which have typical sizes of about a few microns by a few microns (in contrast, a human hair is about 100 microns in diameter).  The study of microresonator dynamics and noise will lead to scientific breakthroughs, because microresonators represent a new regime for laser and resonator physics.  These structures tightly confine light, so light can interact strongly with the atomic medium and the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum.  Practically, the issues of noise and dynamics will be crucial for discovering the ultimate limitations on the performance of ultra-compact optical devices and sources.  These devices will underpin the next generation of communication and sensing technologies.

"With the completion of numerous genome projects there is an increasing interest in understanding how molecules encoded within the genomes interact to define various functional networks of the cell. These intra-cellular networks may be classified as  gene regulatory networks, protein interaction networks, or metabolic networks. Together these networks aim to describe the full set of reactions or molecular interactions between a genome and its environment, ultimately defining the growth and development of an organism. 



At the level of the cell, the chemical dynamics may well be dominated by the action of regulatory molecules that are present at levels of only a few copies per cell. Therefore, the molecular fluctuations of these components may determine the dynamics of the reaction network. These molecular fluctuations appear to have significant consequences, the observed large variation in rates of development, morphology and concentration of molecular species in a cell often lead to a randomization of phenotypic outcomes and non-genetic population heterogeneity. Since these fluctuations may have profound effects on the physiology of the cell, a stochastic model for the intra-cellular reaction networks and a statistical analysis appear to be necessary. 



Such networks of integrated molecular reactions tend to involve  many different molecular species, thus posing a complex analytical problem. For prediction and simulation purposes it is essential to reduce both the model and computational complexity of the problem, while still capturing all of the essential characteristics and potential behavior of the network. The primary goal of my research program is to develop model reduction techniques for stochastic models for such intra-cellular networks.

"The regulation of Photosystem II structure and electron transport activity is strongly affected by environmental factors such as light and the presence of different pollutants which cause inhibitory effects. In this research project, we attempt to understand in which way structure and functions are accommodated to cope with those environmental conditions. When the photosynthetic apparatus is exposed to toxic effects induced by heavy metals and herbicides the excess light energy not used in photochemistry will be dissipated via pigments of the light harvesting complex through thermal dissipation or formation of reactive oxygen species. Our hypothesis is that, under those conditions, the mechanism of energy dissipation will reflect the specificity of the inhibition mechanism induced by heavy metals and herbicides. In our project, by using different species of higher plant and alga and their specific mutants, we will investigate the mechanism of energy dissipation process associated with Photosystem II. Our research objective is to study the relationships between the effects of inhibitors, heavy metals and herbicides induced under strong light intensity and energy dissipation mechanisms. By using highly advanced spectroscopic studies and biochemical methods, experiments will be done in in vitro and in vivo conditions. Results obtained will provide information which can explain how plants can survive and tolerate pollutants toxicity effects under different light conditions. These results will contribute to fundamental knowledge concerning the interaction between inhibitory effects of some pollutants and light energy dissipation mechanism.

"The strength of my research group lies in accurate numerical modeling of interaction between electromagnetic waves and tissue. BREAST CANCER DETECTION WITH MICROWAVES is a novel approach to breast imaging that promises to complement existing diagnostic techniques. Due to a notable contrast in electrical properties of breast tumors with respect to the healthy surrounding tissue, the tumor is ""visible"" to a microwave signal. If such a signal is launched from the skin surface, it penetrates through the healthy tissue until it encounters the tumor. Then, part of the signal ""backscatters"", and part of it is absorbed by the tumor, causing the heating and thermal expansion of the tumor, which generates an acoustic wave. Both the backscatter and the acoustic signals can be captured at the skin surface. The novelty of the proposed research is development of: 1) a three-dimensional model that will couple the electromagnetic, thermal and acoustic processes ; 2) a data fusion algorithm, which will combine the signals obtained by the backscatter of the microwave and by acoustic signal generated by thermal expansion for image enhancement. WIRELESS IMPLANTABLE BIO-SENSORS will enable a researcher to acquire data from electrodes and biological sensors over an extended time-period while allowing the subject with the implant (e.g. mouse) to remain functional and retain a good quality of life. Currently there is no way to remotely (without wires) stimulate and acquire data from a variety of bio-sensors using implantable devices. Technical barriers are: a) Size: implants need to be small, yet electrically efficient, b) Lifetime - requires a battery-less power solution. c) Range beyond the current limitation of 0.5m range, d) Neurophysiology requires multiple channel high-bandwidth data collection, e) Safety: power-delivery management and potential field-hazard assessment. Any sensor prototype that can overcome these obstacles needs to include accurate simulations of in-vivo sensors. My research group will develop advanced numerical models of the in-tissue sensor and optimize its design with two goals: 1) low power deposition in the surrounding tissues and 2) reliability of signal transmission in the heterogeneous tissue.

"My research is focused on physics beyond the standard model, which addresses questions on the forefront of elementary particle physics: what is the origin of mass? why are the electroweak interactions so much weaker than gravity? is there a higgs? is there supersymmetry? is there strong dynamics at the electroweak scale? We expect that many of these questions will be answered by upcoming experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).



More specifically, I have a long-standing interest in supersymmetric theories of nature. If supersymmetry is indeed responsible for the origin of mass, it must be broken. If it exists at the LHC energy scale, the question of the origin of supersymmetry breaking and its manifestation in elementary particle physics would become one of the central issues in particle theory. Most recently, I and collaborators have realized that there exist some new and unexpected possibilities for the way supersymmetry could show up. Together with my students and postdocs, I plan to investigate these possibilities and the way they would manifest themselves at LHC experiments in some detail. 



Another area of research of great interest to me is the dynamics of strongly coupled gauge theories. Apart from purely theoretical interest, this is an area that could become very relevant should the LHC discover that strong dynamics is responsible for the origin of mass. Currently, I am interested in two approaches to the study of the dynamics of chiral gauge theories: by using numerical simulations and by semiclassical methods made possible by considering compactifications of four-dimensional theories.  The former question is one of principle and presents an unsolved problem of lattice gauge theory, while the latter has until recently been largely unexplored, but I (along with others) think that it is full of possibilities and promise.

"This proposal is to facilitate the research needs of the entire Biology and Chemistry/Biochemistry Departments at the University of Windsor. Hence, the areas of science it encompasses are diverse; from cellular and molecular biology/biochemistry/genetics studying areas such as how organisms develop, how cells grow, divide and regulate cell death in normal and abnormal situations, how the body regulates its lipid/fat content, how cells interact with one another and the environment around them to physiological questions relating to how animals process both smell and sound and how this controls important responses to the external environment. Each of these research programs rely very heavily on microscopy as the endpoint to analyse and publish data. Currently this group is sharing a 15 year old core facility microscope which is outdated, heavily utilized and limited in its capabilities with regard to camera resolution and spectral imaging. With our Departments growing in the number of NSERC funded young faculty dependent on microscopy it is absolutely essential that we expand and improve our imaging capabilities here at the University of Windsor. Acquisition of a core facilities microscope, with updated capabilities to image a wide range of different colours at enhanced speed and with much improved resolution is absolutely essential to facilitate the success of the research and training of the programs described in this application.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","University of Windsor",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","Biologie cellulaire","Biologie cellulaire"
"Division into two daughter cells is an event that occurs throughout life in many cell populations and involves the successful duplication of the DNA followed by cell division or cytokinesis. It is essential that these events occur in the correct order, without error and that the cell monitors its size and energy requirements during the formation of a new daughter cell. Coordination and monitoring over these events depends on regulatory proteins called cyclins and a family of catalytic proteins called the cyclin dependent kinases (CDK)s. Cyclin and CDK proteins form a complex that in turn trigger all of the events required to move the cell through these phases of cell growth and division. Formation and activation of these important complexes relies on many layers of regulation, much of which still remains to be resolved. This research program focuses on determining how these complexes are regulated to initiate the onset of cell division. Importantly, our lab has exciting data linking proteins known to monitor nutrient and growth factor content with cell division. We propose that this data reflects a novel checkpoint which is essential for maintaining proper growth control.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","University of Windsor",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Division cellulaire","Biologie cellulaire"

"Although great strides have been made in plant development and systematics using the new tools available through molecular techniques, several key questions remain: 1) Are phylogenies (evolutionary relations) based on molecular data in agreement with those derived from more classical morphological data? And if not can the inconsistencies be resolved? 2) What role does or should development, in particular floral development, play in systematics and in reconstructing phylogenetic homologies? and 3) how applicable are current molecular models of floral and vegetative development to highly unorthodox developments such as leaf apposed tendrils (inflorescences) in the grape family (Vitaceae) and the axillary complex (tendril, axillary bud, male and female inflorescence) in the cucumber family (Cucurbitaceae)? The objectives of the proposed research are to address the above questions by focusing on two highly derived angiosperm families; the Vitaceae and the Cucurbitaceae. Our methodology in the proposed research is to look at comparative development and to match our findings with current DNA-based phylogenies. For our developmental studies we plan to use several techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, epi-illumination light microscopy (recently modified by our lab to increase depth of focus), confocal laser microscopy and various histological protocols including paraffin and plastic thick sectioning. Our approach to this research is unique since very few labs have the morphological and developmental databases to allow for extensive comparisons with molecular phylogenies. As well, our goal is to collaborate with labs working with molecular phylogenies and with molecular development in order to build up a combined data set that is fully representative and as complete as possible. The significance of our approach is to bring together as much comparative data as we can, both developmental and molecular, in order to construct a robust phylogeny and also to understand complex evolutionary origins such as the tendril in the Vitaceae.

"A reliable vehicle is necessary to access wilderness field sites in support of the field programs of John R. Post and Sean Rogers of the University of Calgary which focus on the ecology, evolution and conservation of freshwater fishes. Their research programs depend on access to undisturbed natural and experimental populations of fishes throughout Alberta and British Columbia. Our programs strive to understand the mechanistic basis for behavioral, physiological, population and evolutionary traits of freshwater fishes. We use a combination of field sampling and whole lake field experiments to characterize and test hypotheses about ecological and evolutionary processes in nature. The remote nature of our research sites and the field equipment used necessitate use of an extended cab, 4WD, 3/4 ton vehicle with canopy and boat rack. Our combined use of the vehicle involves 10 months of continuous use and rental of an equivalent truck is prohibitively expensive. This proposed vehicle purchase will replace one that is no longer repairable after 20 years and 300,000 km of use in field research. These research programs depend on a safe, reliable and cost-effective research vehicle for the researchers and trainees to continue their productive and important research.  Purchasing the vehicle is by far the most economical strategy to meet our combined needs and maximize the efficient use of NSERC research funds.

"The abundance of fish and many other organisms tend to vary substantially over time within populations, and among populations. This variation often impacts other species within the communities and ecosystems that they inhabit. It is of course also important to humankind, particularly if the species is one that we exploit for food, or if it is a ""pest"" species. My research is aimed at understanding the biological processes that lead to this variability. In fish populations, much of this variability originates in the early life stages that are particularly susceptible to predators and the vagaries of the environment. Therefore, variability in survival of these young life stages is reflected in older life stages. The objectives of the research proposed here include: (1) understanding the ecological and environmental processes that lead to survival of the young stages of fish populations, (2) understanding of how variation in early survival feeds back to variability at adult life stages and (3) how we might manage fisheries harvest in ways that ensure viable populations in the future.",Environment,"University of Calgary",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","�volution et �cologie","�volution et �cologie"

"Many modern advanced materials of economic importance cannot be analyzed accurately using classical solid mechanics. These materials include, for example, synthetic polymers, foams, graphite and fiber-reinforced composites. In addition, classical solid mechanics fails to predict adequately the elastic behavior of human bones. This is attributed to the fact that these materials have microstructure, which has a significant effect on their deformations.



The proposed program is concerned with the construction of analytical solutions and the mechanical analysis of problems related to advanced materials. Specifically, the incorporation of the effects of material microstructure into classical models and theories of elasticity.



The theory of Micropolar Elasticity is used to describe deformations of materials when the microstructure is significant. The physical nature of these materials requires the asymmetric description of deformation, since classical theories fail to predict their physical and mechanical behaviour. For this reason micropolar theories for elastic solids and fluids need to be developed to accommodate a wide range of problems relating to crack and inclusion problems in composite, granular, polymeric materials and human bones.

 

As a result of the proposed program, we will get a deeper understanding of deformations of advanced materials with significant microstructure, which will find applications, for example, in aircraft industry and design of human bone implants.

"Le premier mandat de la Chaire de recherche industrielle CRSNG - Universit� Laval en sylviculture, et faune visait � mettre au point un syst�me sylvicole permettant de maintenir la structure irr�guli�re des peuplements et les habitats fauniques qui y sont associ�s. Dans le second mandat de la chaire, nous proposons un programme de recherche ax� sur la probl�matique du maintien des populations de caribou forestier dans le cadre des activit�s d'am�nagement forestier des �cosyst�mes bor�aux domines par de vieilles for�ts  � structure irr�guli�re. Puisque le domaine vital du caribou forestier est tr�s grand et que ses exigences d'habitat requi�rent la pr�sence de grands massifs de vieux peuplements, nous croyons que les pratiques d'am�nagement li�es au seul maintien des populations de caribou sera suffisant pour maintenir l'abondance et la richesse des autres esp�ces, autant animales que v�g�tales.

"Histophilus somni is a Gram negative pathogen of cattle capable of causing a variety of diseases, including infections of lung, heart, joints, brain and reproductive tract.  The control of H. somni infection has been accomplished through both antibiotic treatment as well as vaccination.  However, given that the prevalence of this disease syndrome has been increasing over the past decade, improved control methods are clearly needed.  Central to the ability of the organism to cause disease is its capability to evade host innate immune responses, the first line of defense against bacterial pathogens.  Specifically, H. somni is able to suppress the antimicrobial activities of leukocytes, including PMNs and macrophages, resulting in enhanced survival of the organism and dissemination throughout the body.  It is our hypothesis that H. somni produces specific proteins capable of modifying the host innate immune response, resulting in a general suppression.  In order to test this hypothesis, we will characterize new proteins produced by the bacterium while it is incubated with bovine leukocytes using both functional genomic as well as traditional protein biochemistry techniques.  These proteins will be fully characterized and the genes coding for each one isolated and used to construct mutant H. somni lacking each specific gene.  These will then be tested for their ability to interfere with PMN function.  Finally, we will test the ability of these mutants to cause disease in a bovine infection model.  Ultimately, this will lead to the development of novel targets for both vaccine and therapeutic development.","Veterinary pharmaceuticals","University of Saskatchewan",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Bact�riologie",Microbiologie

"The use of computational tools for research into physical phenomena (e.g. wireless signal transmission, medical imaging) has become ubiquitous for several decades now, in large part due to the great leaps forward in computational power.  The many methods of casting analytic problems has been mirrored by the many forms of computational tools that have sprung up.  Researchers and practitioners in the area today can find a myriad of software packages on the market, with each one boasting improvements that escalate from year to year.  Furthermore, these packages and improvements are very often utilized as an integral part of the design process for a variety of applications ranging from microwave devices, to antennas, and on to optical components.



One of the objectives of my research program is to improve and enhance one of the mainstream simulation techniques in electromagnetics - the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method. Improvements to the FDTD method will be significant because they will allow us to study new problems with greater accuracy.  And because FDTD is so prevalent a research tool, improvements will have wide-ranging implications in fields ranging from antenna design, to optical device modeling, and into geophysical and seismic modeling.



My second objective is to use the method for two problems of interest: optical data storage, and the design of advanced and improved Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems for medical diagnosis.  Our new optical data storage modality holds the promise of even denser storage media with faster access times.  The improvements in imaging from advanced MRI designs are obviously of great importance in providing the best health diagnosis to Canadians and others.

"The proposed research program is designed to study methodologies that should improve the Henry reaction.  This chemical reaction generates key synthetic intermediates that can be used in the pharmaceutical industry.  For example, 1,2-aminoalcohol functionality can be produced after reduction of the Henry reaction product.  This functionality is found in chemicals that can affect neurotransmission and is found in Tamiflu, the only drug that is believed to stop avian flu.   



The Henry reaction has inherent thermodynamic problems.  To solve these problems, the nitroalkane used in the reaction is used in large excess, and thus complex large nitroalkane reagents cannot be used in the reaction and intramolecular reactions a very difficult to perform.  To solve this problem, we propose to modify the reaction conditions use either silyl nitronates or boron nitronates.  These modifications should allow for less equivalents of the nitroalkane within the reaction conditions and thus allow researchers to use more complex starting materials.  More importantly, intramolecular reactions should now become accessible and create new synthetic routes for Tamiflu, which presently has a severe supply problem.  During this research program, the stereochemical outcome of these new reactions will also be probed.  This work will also provide university students the opportunity to gain valuable experience in synthetic organic chemistry and enhance their problem solving skills

"The growing number of computer users, increasing amount of data, and proliferating data usage styles yield data that does not fit well within traditional data management solutions.  My research hypothesis is that as the number of computer users grow, there will be ever more of this data to be managed.  My objective is to use traditional data management techniques to harness this unmanaged data, particularly heterogeneous data used by many parties.  In particular, I seek to (1) enable users to better understand their data when it is managed inside a system that is not of their design, whether it is a conglomeration of disparate data from many sources, or their own data stored in a different data model and (2) enable integration of data from multiple non-traditional data sources (e.g., Computer Aided Design (CAD) or Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data).","Computer software","University of British Columbia",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Gestion de bases de donn�es","Technologie de l'information"

"The research in my group encompasses a variety of projects sharing interest for biodiversity and carbon cycling as a key function of the ecosystem. We are working in the tropics, a biome most important for the global carbon cycle and for biodiversity. The present proposal concentrates on two short-term objectives: (I) the search for mechanisms underlying the observed biodiversity effects reported in our tropical tree plantation, (II) the extension of our analysis of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning to natural tropical forests.  

In 2001-2003, I established in Sardinilla, Panama, a tree plantation designed to test the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF). This plantation, consisting of 60 diversity plots of 1- to 18- native tree species, will serve as a basis for my research in the next five years.I propose studying neighborhood effects focusing on competition for light as a key structuring factor. I am also interested in the multi-functionality of ecosystems and will examine the feed-back loops between tree crown  and soil physical characteristics, e.g. temperature. I hypothesize that tree diversity, by altering tree architecture, will affect soil respiration.

The knowledge that we build in Sardinilla experiment will be expanded to examine the biodiversity-carbon storage relationship in a natural forest.  To do so, we will take advantage of a 50 hectare permanent forest plot established also in Panama, on nearby Barro Colorado Island, by the Center for Tropical Forest Science.  It has been proposed that species selection effect might dominate the BEF relationship at small scale but that this effect would even-out at larger scale. Testing this idea will be an important focus of our work on Barro Colorado Island. I anticipate that main contributions of the proposed research will be improved understanding of scale-dependency in BEF relationships and of indirect feed-back loops between different ecosystem traits and biodiversity.    )

"    )	The research has as a long-term practical objective to develop, test and implement metal-ligand coordination complexes in catalytic roles in fuel cells, photovoltaic cells, energy storage and information storage. This builds upon expertise acquired with ruthenium- and titanium-containing coordination complexes and in the synthesis of specialized ligands, and seeks to make more fundamental advances in synthetic methodology and structural analysis, to gain a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanisms, and to study the relationships between structural, electronic and photophysical properties. In the short-term, the five-year plan includes efforts to (i) build more efficient carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction catalysts, and determine the mechanism of action, (ii) investigate a hitherto-unexplored family of photovoltaic sensitizers and implement reductive quenching for some, (iii) anchor the photo- and electro-catalytic centres to electrodes through electropolymerization, (iv) test a new information storage scheme employing spectroscopic and electrochemical responses to read, write and erase data, (v) develop materials that can self-assemble into linear, photo- and electro-active arrays of controlled length, and (vi) investigate the coordination chemistry and electrochemistry of novel titanium complexes as potential electrocatalysts of methanol oxidation for Direct Methanol Fuel Cells. 

    )	Some of proposed work will employ expertise and equipment in other labs, in particular in Prof. Sylvie Morin's for the photovoltaic and surface work, and in Prof. Barry Lever's lab for the electrochemical reduction of CO2. The remainder of the work is completely independent. The research will employ and train four graduate students (more, if some are shared with our collaborators) as well as several undergraduate project students per year. Each student will be exposed to a rich array of techniques and will acquire a diverse set of skills in synthesis, structural characterization, spectroscopy, electrochemistry, photochemistry and, when shared, computational methods, surface electrochemistry or photovoltaic cell construction and characterization.

"Major environmental changes now underway combined to increased commercial exploitation of northern resources currently and dramatically impose a stress on ecosystems, namely by altering the fate of contaminants. To ensure sound management of these resources and protection of population health, it is critical to further our abilities to predict the fate of toxicants and to develop novel remediation strategies in landscapes and conditions typically Canadian. The long-term goal of my lab's research will be to advance our knowledge of metal and metalloids biogeochemistry in cold environments with an emphasis on microbial processes. Mercury (Hg), for example, is a heavy metal, a global pollutant and a potent neurotoxin in its methylated form. The pathway affecting its transformations in the Arctic and in temperate locations are diverse and involved both photochemical reactions and microbial processes. I am particularly interested in the mechanisms that allow microbes to influence contaminant transformations. Indeed, they are at the base of any food webs and their physiologies are directly controlled by global environmental changes, such as global warming. The short-term goal of the proposed research is to characterize Hg transformation, uptake and transfer in cold food webs by using a combination of field and laboratory experiments. The goal is to provide transformation rates that can be incorporated into predictive models as well as new avenues for possible remediation at high latitude through a better understanding of microbial interaction with contaminants. Students in my lab interested in addressing these questions will be trained in cutting edge techniques in molecular biogeochemistry both in the lab and in the field, providing them with skills suited for subsequent careers in fundamental and applied research or natural resource management.

"Quantum information science is a young and promising research field. Its primary goal is to control physical systems that obey the laws of quantum mechanics for information processing tasks. This possibility has already had an important impact on fundamental science and could lead to revolutionary technological applications. In particular, a quantum computer could rapidly execute certain computations that require an exponential amount of time on a conventional computer. Quantum cryptography on the other hand offers the possibility of private communication whose security rely on the fundamental laws of physics.



However, quantum mechanical systems are particularly susceptible to noise. Hence, the implementation of these technologies relies on our ability to devise robust control techniques that can operate on large-scale systems despite the presence of noise. Quantum error correction is the most powerful tool for this task. The primary goals of our researches is to develop new and more powerful error correction techniques. 



We will also exploit some important connections between quantum error correction and problems in solid-state physics. Indeed, decoding a quantum error-correcting code is a quantum statistical inference problem similar to those encountered in the context of quantum many-body physics. This connections will be exploited in both directions: 1) The new error correction techniques will be based on many-body methods and 2) The decoding algorithms will be adapted for the numerical study of interacting quantum particles that manifest striking properties such as superconductivity. The study of these compounds is a complex task and new simulations algorithms can lead to important breakthroughs in our understanding of their physical properties.

"The proposed work aims to investigate the longer-term alterations that occur in the cerebral circulation in response to hypoxia and altitude over a period ranging from several hours to 14 days. The research program will be conducted in the laboratory at the University of Calgary, and in the Yukon at the Kluane Lake Research Station (KLRS) and on a high plateau (Mount Queen Mary) in the St. Elias Mountain Range.  The studies in Calgary will investigate the alterations that occur in the cerebrovascular control system of men and women volunteers, during wakefulness and during sleep, when the arterial blood gas tensions are altered in a pre-defined and fully controlled manner for a period ranging from minutes to several (i.e., 8-12) hours. Studies in the Yukon will investigate the adaptive nature of the cerebrovascular responses to prolonged exposure to hypoxia at rest and during exercise by studying healthy men and women near sea level (at KLRS) and during acclimatization (i.e., over 10-14 days) to altitude (on Mount Queen Mary; 3,245 m above sea level). We have established an important and necessary collaboration with the Arctic Institute of North America (AINA) for the proposed studies in the Yukon. The AINA is based at the University of Calgary but operates the KLRS, where the infrastructure and human resources are in place to support a high altitude research program. The proposed program will have a major impact in helping advance our knowledge of human cerebrovascular physiology and the adaptations that ensue with exposure to hypoxia and altitude. The proposed studies are innovative and important because they will help elucidate the effects of hypoxia and altitude on cerebrovascular regulation in humans and they will address the mechanisms involved. Upon completion, we expect to 1) characterize the alterations in CBF that unfold during the initial acclimatization (< 12 hours) and acclimatization (1-14 days) phases of exposure to the hypoxia of altitude, and 2) determine the role of oxygen sensing genes and some of its induced genes on the observed alterations in CBF with exposure to hypoxia and altitude.

"My research program is concerned with how infants successfully organize the world into meaningful  object categories. There is currently a hot debate about whether infants' first categories are relatively broad or relatively narrow, as well as about the  conceptual nature of the categories infants form (Mandler, 2004, Quinn, 2002). One basic issue about which there is considerable controversy is the relative importance of conceptual features (features that cannot be seen) and perceptual features (what objects look like) in infants' formation of categories. This issue will be the main  focus of my research program. In a series of experiments, I  will examine how experience with objects and knowledge of object labels impact on the categories infants form, more specifically on developmental changes in the use of static and dynamic features  (e.g., object parts) to group items. Infants aged 9 to 24 months will be administered a wide range of categorization tasks,  including the object  examination, sequential touching, infant-controlled habituation, and generalized imitation techniques. We will also collect data on scanning patterns of objects with eye tracking equipment adapted for infants. The effect of exposure and object labels on category formation will be examined by manipulating familiarity with objects, including  exposure to video clips showing moving category exemplars and by measuring comprehension and  production of object labels. Taken together, the proposed  research program should shed new light on how infants establish their categories during the first two years of  life.

"Bovine milk proteins are now recognized as a source of peptides having biological activities such as antihypertensive, immunomodulating, lipid and mineral-binding ant antimicrobial.  These so-called bioactive peptides are increasingly used as health ingredients in food systems or as supplements. The bioactive peptides are characterized by different charge (cationic, anionic, neutral) and molecular weight values (500-2000 Da) can be produced by enzymatic hydrolysis.   The main problem associated with the production of bioactive peptides is to find a process to purify them from a complex mixture in order to increase their potency. The present work is based on the hypothesis that a membrane-based process integrating size, charge and solubility as separation parameters can successfully achieve the purification (>95%) of peptides from complex mixture.  The aim of the work is to develop a membrane-based purification procedure for cationic, anionic and neutral peptides from milk. The objectives of the project will be to (1) Evaluate the potential of the different NF membrane materials commercially available for the separation of acidic peptides from complex mixtures; (2) Characterize the effect of the presence of polyelectrolytes (polysaccharides) on solubility, secondary structure and peptide-peptide interactions in b-LG peptide mixtures and NF fractions;(3) Characterize the binding profile of b-LG peptides on the selectivity of NF separations; (4) Validate a separation approach combining NF and pre-treatments with complex systems such as complete milk or whey protein hydrolysates. This research will provide un-precedent opportunities to better understand the separation of peptides from complex mixtures and to apply the knowledge to other peptides, such as growth factors, naturally-occurring in milk.

"Inhibition of brain activity is fundamentally important for the control of normal behaviour. The majority of this control is accomplished by the neurochemical GABA. GABA acts at sites in the brain that are highly variable in their structure. The variability of this structure is known to have considerable influence on physiological and pharmacological functionality of GABA. However, the scope of our understanding between structure and function is far from complete. We also do not fully understand how naturally occurring  brain chemicals derived  from steroids effect this system, yet these substances, referred as neurosteroids, have profound behavioural effects. At high levels they can induce unconsciousness while at lower doses they may reduce our reactivity to stressful situations. While it is clear that neurosteroids interact with GABA sites is not clear how the structure of GABA affects the differing responses of GABA activity to neurosteroids.  In order to resolve these important questions the research that will be carried out by this discovery grant will alter the structure of GABA sites (receptors) and determine what features are important for neurosteroid activity. Another goal of this project is alter GABA receptor structure and determine how this affects the inhibitory function of GABA. These studies are fundamental to our long term goal to determine how this neurochemical  governs brain behaviour.

"Consider spoken-dialogue managers, mobile robot controllers, automated monitoring/prompting systems for seniors with dementia or any other complex system that must accomplish a fairly complicated task.  The conception of such systems is particularly challenging due to the noisy nature of the sensors (e.g., noisy speech recognition, noisy sonars) as well as the uncertain and interdependent effects of system actions (e.g., uncertain effect of prompts on seniors, interdependent and noisy motor controls in robotics).  As a result, it is generally impossible to design complex robust systems by hand coding control policies.  The fields of decision-theoretic planning and learning have made significant advances in the development of automated techniques to generate robust control policies that could revolutionize the next generation of computer systems.  Instead of programming a policy directly, an algorithm is used to optimize a policy based on a model or simulator of the system and its environment.  However, eliciting the domain knowledge necessary to specify a model or simulator, and validating/explaining the resulting policy are two major bottlenecks ignored by the research community that are holding back the adoption of this disruptive technology.  Knowledge elicitation and policy explanation are particularly challenging since non-technical domain experts tend to have partial and imprecise knowledge, and often need high-level explanations of the policy where technical details are abstracted away to better convey the intuition.  Hence, the objectives of this research are i) to design general and principled techniques to elicit and encode partial/imprecise domain knowledge about the system, the environment and the desired policy, ii) to develop algorithms that can exploit as much domain knowledge as possible to improve scalability, and iii) to create generic tools to validate and explain the decisions made by a policy at an appropriate level for developers and non-technical experts.

"Decomposition of organic matter in the biosphere is the task of all organisms on the Earth, but ultimately degradation of the nastiest and most complex molecules falls to bacteria and fungi. While these organisms have evolved to deal with a wide variety of natural substrates, they are increasingly challenged by man-made compounds which they may or may not degrade.  These degradative activities are thus of interest: to know what Nature in its incredible variety is already capable of; how and why microbes fail with man-made compounds; and how these activities might be adapted or modified to degrade chemical wastes, clean up pollutants, or transform natural materials.  We are interested here in biodegradative reactions, carried out by single species of bacteria and fungi, generally to derive energy and support growth. 

   The focus is on aerobic degradation of a limited number of simple aromatic compounds-phenols and hydroxybenzoates.  These compounds form the nucleus for a wide variety of chemicals that are toxic and which cannot be degraded by humans and other higher animals.  The ability of bacteria and fungi to degrade them is dependent on the action of enzymes, intracellular catalysts that specifically and efficiently direct the breakdown sequence.  We are continuing our studies of selected enzymes involved in the degradation of phenols by a soil bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain CF600, which was originally isolated from activated sewage sludge.  The first and last enzymes of the pathway are particularly interesting as they require several proteins to work together in ways that are currently not well understood. We are also looking at a range of intracellular enzymes from a diverse group of fungi that degrade similar types of compounds.  Our goal in this part of the project is to learn more about such degradative enzymes in fungi, which are less well understood than those of bacteria, but which are likely to be important in the natural environment as well as in laboratory studies.

"Recent years have seen a burst of activity in the interface of harmonic analysis and its related fields (such as partial differential equations, combinatorics, number theory, and mathematical physics), with beautiful and

mutually beneficial consequences. Long-standing open problems in harmonic analysis have been solved using combinatorial techniques, while tools from harmonic analysis have helped in proving exciting results in number theory, partial differential equations and mathematical physics. In this proposal, the applicant outlines future goals in three areas of harmonic analysis: (a) Fourier estimates for cones and their applications, (b) analysis of linear and monomial polyhedra, and (c) oscillatory integral operators with degenerate phases.



Projects 1 and 2 address a class of problems that may be approached using Wolff's microlocal estimate for 

light cones (arising in his proof of the local smoothing conjecture), and would answer a variety of questions 

regarding averaging and Fourier integral operators and partial differential equations. They necessitate a deeper understanding and extension of the delicate combinatorial arguments employed in his proof. Results from project 3 would mark nontrivial progress on a much-studied open question on Bergman kernel estimates, and would be of significant interest in several complex variables. Project 4 addresses a problem of which very

little is known at the moment, but which has deep ties not only to numerous questions in harmonic analysis (regarding degenerate Fourier integral operators), but also to the extremely rich theory of resolution of singularities.

"""Spintronics"" and ""organic electronics"" are two emerging frontiers of modern electronics. Spintronics aims to harness the spin degree of freedom of charge carriers (instead of traditional charge degree of freedom) in semiconductors to realize novel device functionalities. These include low power computing, non-volatile memories and ultra-sensitive magnetic field sensors. Organic electronics, on the other hand, offers mechanically flexible, optically active and inexpensive devices which have found myriad applications in portable ""roll up"" displays and lighting, electronic papers, smart cards, organic labels and tags, smart textiles, solar cells and batteries. The goal of the proposed research program is to blend spintronics and organic electronics to realize a new class of ""organic-spintronic"" nanodevices. These devices will integrate the attractive material properties of organic semiconductors with spintronic functionalities.



Here we propose to develop two distinct organic spintronic nanodevices: (1) nanowire organic magnetic random access memory (nanowire OMRAM) and (2) nanowire spintronic OLED (organic light emitting diode). We argue that nanowire OMRAM devices will be inexpensive, ultrathin, ultralight, flexible and will possess high data storage density. This ""plastic"" memory chip can be seamlessly integrated with virtually all organic electronic applications to realize smart performance. We also claim that nanowire spintronic OLEDs will be brighter and more energy-efficient than conventional OLEDs. This will have an immense impact on battery-powered organic LED applications such as cell phone displays and PDA screens.

"Catalysis is an important component of energy technologies, and the development of improved catalysts can dramatically improve the performance of fuel cell systems by increasing the activity of crucial reactions. In this work, we seek to develop methods to optimize catalysts using detailed models. This will be an improvement on current practice, which involves trial-and-error experimentation. The models we develop are multiscale, and take into account effects at the electronic, molecular and reactor scales. This enables us to account for all relevant phenomena in predicting the effect of catalyst properties on reaction rates and selectivity. In this work, we develop methods, by conducting judicious experiments, to improve the predictive power of these models. We then use the relationships described by the models to identify the catalytic properties that lead to the optimal reaction behavior. Having found the properties of the optimal catalyst, we then identify multimetallic catalysts (alloys) that display these properties. We also use the multiscale models to optimize reactor design.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","University of Alberta",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie chimique","G�nie chimique"

"Canada is the world's second largest pork exporter with over 1 million tonnes of pork exported in the year 2005, valued at almost $3 billion. The growth in the livestock industry has been possible mainly due to the advent of intensive livestock operations (ILOs). However, they have also increased the quantity and rate of waste production exponentially. For example, manure production rates have increased by as much as 75% between 1986 and 1996 in Canada, thereby heightening the risk of soil, water and air pollution. The annual manure production in Canada was 177.5 million tonnes in 2001. 



     Veterinary pharmaceuticals (VPs) are used routinely in ILOs not only to control livestock diseases, but also to promote livestock growth. Most VPs, however, are poorly absorbed in the animal's gut and, with an average degradation rate of 50%, approximately 8000 tons of VPs, given annually to animals in Europe and North America, remain unmetabolized in animal feces and urine, thereby polluting environment.



    Therefore, investigations are urgently needed to investigate the environmental risks posed by VPs in manure. They could also be increasing the half-life of pesticides in soil by killing the susceptible microorganisms and thus significantly affecting their microbial degradation. There is a great need to carry-out studies in order to determine the fate and transport of these micro-pollutants in the colder Canadian environment. 



    Preferential flow in soils may be playing a big role in causing groundwater pollution of shallow groundwater and surface water bodies. Mathematical modeling can not only simulate the fate and transport of VPs in soil but also help in the development of best management practices to reduce pollution. Composting, aerobic or anaerobic digestion, and vegetated filter strips may also minimize environmental pollution from VPs.

"The oxidation of biological molecules (lipids, proteins and nucleic acids) has been implicated in virtually every degenerative disorder, ranging from cardiovascular disease to cancer. The mechanisms by which these oxidation reactions occur are generally free radical reactions, involving species with one unpaired electron. These highly reactive intermediates are also involved in the oxidation of items of commerce, such as lubricating oils, rubbers, foodstuffs and polymer materials. Research in our laboratory focuses on the characterization of the mechanisms of these oxidation reactions and the development of novel means to control or prevent these reactions for both therapeutic and industrial applications. In contrast to the uncontrolled oxidation of biological molecules described above, many classes of enzymes catalyze similar oxidation chemistry in a very highly controlled way. Understanding how Nature has evolved enzymes to accomplish this incredibly difficult task is critical to our understanding of enzyme catalysis, in general. Thus, a second vein of investigation in our laboratory deals with probing the origins of the enzymatic control of radical reactions and the application of these ideas to the design of compounds that may serve as effective inhibitors of these enzymes where a therapeutic possibility exists.","Physical sciences","Queen's University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Cin�tique, interm�diaires r�actifs et m�canismes des r�actions","Chimie organique"

"Using geophysical waveform data to form images of the subsurface is akin to computer tomography methods used in medical tomography. However, due to the limitations imposed by the earth's surface, by the dramatic complexities of structural geology, and other difficulties such as waveform attenuation and anisotropy, the geophysical imaging problem is inherently difficult.



The more rigourous our modelling methods are, the better the quality of the information we discover about the subsurface. By using advanced forward and inverse modelling methods we can achieve unprecedented resolution from a wide range of geophysical experiments.



Practical applications for these methods include deep crustal imaging (to learn about the roots of the continental and oceanic crust), exploration for hydrocarbons and mineral resources, and high resolution engineering surveys. Most recently, some of our geophysical methods are finding application in medical tomography (in the early detection of breast cancers).

"Infrared remote sensing has long been used to learn about the composition and structure of planetary atmospheres. The basic principle of atmospheric remote sensing is to determine a property of the atmosphere by detecting spectrally related features in a radiation field that has passed through the atmosphere. Spectra of the outer planets and their moons have been recorded by various instruments at ground-based telescopes, on aircraft and on spacecraft. Laboratory studies are often required to properly interpret mission data, particularly for planetary and lunar atmospheres that have compositions and temperature and pressure regimes quite different from those in the terrestrial atmosphere.

    As the spectral resolution of planetary observations has improved, the spectroscopic parameters used to interpret these observations have also been required to improve.  Usually this necessitates the recording and analysis of high-quality laboratory spectra.  Furthermore, these laboratory spectra should be obtained for gas temperature and pressure conditions as close as possible to those expected on the planet or satellite of interest.

    The long-term goal of my research program is to develop spectroscopic techniques to increase our understanding of Earth and planetary atmospheres. Our research has direct application to the analysis of high resolution atmospheric spectra acquired by remote sensing instruments. This work will also improve our understanding of past and future observations of planets and be useful for designing instrumentation for future space missions. The current proposal will address the following specific objectives: (1) experimental studies of line shapes and molecular collisional dynamics in molecules of environmental interest, (2) theoretical modelling of line mixing effects and broadening parameters, (3) development of novel spectroscopic tools that combine investigations of molecular structure and molecular interactions with line shape studies.

"Having measured litter decomposition rates in dozens of experiments over the last 20 years, I have concluded that we will make no further progress in measuring, modeling or understanding decomposition rates until we better understand the process itself, in particular the later stages of decomposition. Most of our estimates of litter decomposition rates have been derived from studies in which soil macrofauna have been excluded, and thus may seriously misrepresent long-term decay rates.  Most of the litter consumed by soil fauna is passed through the gut rather than completely decomposed; thus understanding of the fate of fecal material of soil fauna is necessary before we can accurately predict and model litter decomposition. Recent development of stable isotope analysis techniques allows us to address this previously intractable problem.   In the proposed research, I will use stable isotope analysis to determine the fate of litter carbon as it moves through the soil food web, and compare rates of C, N and P mineralization in ant nests compared with surrounding forest floor to better represent nutrient cycling in dry forest ecosystems in B.C.  I will also investigate the movement of N and characterize the nitrifying organisms in forest floors of different tree species with known differences in nitrate production and availability to improve our understanding of nitrogen cycling in forest soils and the factors that influence it.  My findings will be communicated to modelers to assist to improving the reliability of ecosystem and carbon budget models used to inform decisions and policies related to forest management and carbon accounting.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","University of British Columbia",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Biologie et microbiologie","Science du sol"

"The Brockhouse Institute for Materials Research - named in honour of McMaster Professor and 1994 Nobel laureate Bertram Brockhouse - supports interdisciplinary materials-based research. The Institute was one of the first materials research centers in North America and is the largest such institute in Canada. This year it is celebrating its 40th anniversary.  With over 120 faculty members from across the country, Insitute researchers are widely recognized as leaders in electron microscopy, crystal growth, polymer synthesis, processing and characterization, X-ray characterization, and materials discovery and refinement. 



The Institute is home to the Canadian Centre for Electron Microcsopy; home of the world's most advanced analytical electron microscopes.  These are instruments not only capable of resolving physical structures down to the atomic scale, they are also capable of extracting electronic and chemical information with the same high resolution.   This information is augmented by the capabilities of the McMaster Analytical X-Ray Facility, one of the most comprehensive X-Ray laboratories in North America. The Institute contributes most of the large pristine single crystals grown in Canada, and has recently invested in a new diffractometer to use the McMaster Nuclear Reactor as part of the crystal refinement process.



The vision behind the Brockhouse Institute is that the very best research is always driven by the imagination of the best researchers.  The objective of this Institute is to develop versatile tools at the highest level and provide the infrastructure, access and expertise that researchers from across Canada require to take full advantage of them in the pursuit of their ideas.   The Institute is highly focused on student training with the perspective that the best training is direct involvement in the high-impact research at the cutting-edge of science and engineering.

"Technological advances depend upon the development of new materials. The short history of personal computers is a good example. In December, 1981, when hard drives first became affordable for use in PCs, the cost of memory storage was $228 USD per megabyte (MB). Today, the largest commercially available hard drive is 500 gigabytes (GB) which costs roughly $250 USD. That is about 0.05 cents per MB. For comparison, the cost of 500 GB of data storage in 1981 would have been approximately $114 million USD. This vast decrease in the cost (and physical size) of memory storage is largely due to the development of new magnetic materials. These materials are generally cheaper to process and have superior data storage and stability properties.



Our research aims to further advance the development of magnetic materials and new materials with ""switchable"" properties (i.e., more than one stable state, magnetic or otherwise). In contrast to the ""top down"" approach adopted by lithographic and printing techniques, we are taking a ""bottom up"" approach by designing materials at a molecular level. We start by preparing molecules that have unpaired electrons and hence the quantum mechanical property called ""spin"", the fundamental property giving rise to magnetism. Then we coordinate these molecules to metal atoms to generate a larger molecule with enhanced spin. At this point, magnet properties ""designed"" into the molecules will be apparent in the bulk material. We can now modify our design to promote enhanced bulk properties. This ""molecular tuning"" is achieved through well-understood synthetic chemical techniques and can generate a large number of new molecule-based materials with a wide range of magnetic properties. A further advantage of our ""bottom up"" approach is that other potentially desirable properties can be built into the new magnetic materials, including mechanical flexibility, optical transparency, electroluminescence, and conductivity or resistivity.

"La prolif�ration d'algues bleues-vertes (cyanobact�ries) repr�sente une menace envers les sources d'eau potable desservant un grand nombre de Canadiens s'approvisonnant en eaux de surface.

A major focus is the goal of managing fertility in cattle, which has great importance to the Canadian agricultural industry. A secondary goal is gaining new knowledge about normal and disease states that may have implications for women and other species such as companion animals and endangered animals.



In order to study the biology of the ovary and uterus, a useful approach that avoids the use of live animals, is to collect tissue from the abattoir and to culture this tissue in the laboratory. Similarly, there are a number of immortalized cell-lines that our centre is also using as models for animal cells.

"Most life experiences are not truly unique: People tend to experience the same types of events repeatedly, with minor variations (e.g., going to work, visiting the doctor). When children experience several similar versions of an event, the task of accurately remembering which particular occurrence involved which details (e.g., what colour of tie was worn on Tuesday versus Friday) is cognitively challenging. From decades of research on children's memory for repeated events, we know that reports of repeated experiences differ from reports of unique experiences. We also know that with sufficiently supportive retrieval cues, accessing details from particular occurrences is possible. However, little research has been conducted that has addressed the precise nature of these ""sufficiently supportive cues"". In this work, I will explore various techniques that will assist in retrieval of memory for occurrences of repeated events.



The results from this research may enhance both our understanding of how memory for individual occurrences of repeated events is represented and be used to develop strategies that use this understanding to facilitate retrieval of such instances from memory. In an applied context, these retrieval cues may assist forensic investigators in better questioning children about experiences that have occurred more than once  (e.g., sexual abuse).",Psychology,"University of Regina",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Science cognitive -- principes fondamentaux",Psychologie
"Peatlands comprise 14% of Canada's land area. The accumulation of peat (a major carbon sink) is largely due to the presence of Sphagnum mosses. Sphagnum mosses lack roots and a vascular structure to deliver water to the growing part of the plant (top). It has generally been assumed that water is wicked up from the water table below through the small capillary spaces that are formed between adjacent strands of moss, as they cluster together in a community. The amount of water they can retain or draw from below is an important control on the rate of growth, but also the rate of decomposition of plant material. While liquid flow through capillary spaces has been assumed, the process has not been well documented because of the inability of standard methods to measure it, and a poor understanding of the process relating to the structure of the plant. In my laboratory we have just developed instrumentation to measure the properties of the moss that control liquid flow. We are now set to perform a series of experiments to investigate the migration and storage of water through the mosses to test its ability to sustain moisture in the critical growing part of the plant. This proposal also aims to test this for various species of Sphagnum, which have distinctly different community structures, and therefore occupy different niches in the wetland. In a related set of experiments we want to find if vapour flow is important in keeping the upper part of the mosses hydrated - even though we know the amount of water in vapour is relatively small. Understanding these processes is important for the restoration of mined peatlands, where the substrate restricts water flow to mosses that could potentially regenerate there. The above experiments will be directed at understanding this process, so that we can better manage disturbed peatlands, or at least manage our expectation for their recovery. The overall (long-term) objectives of my research, therefore, are to use lab and field tests to measure and understand the water stores and fluxes within Sphagnum mosses, between mosses and mined peat substrates, and to model these processes.

Diamond mining operations near Attawapiskat, Ontario are set to begin in early 2008. Over 90% of this area is covered by peatlands (muskeg). Dewatering of the mine will pull water from the underlying permeable limestone aquifer that could cause or accelerate downward seepage of water from the surface system, and partially drain about 3000 km2 of peatland. We anticipate distinct spatial patterns of drainage related to the strength of the connection between the upper and lower hydrological systems. Relatively permeable bioherms (ancient coral reefs) that protrude to the surface from the bedrock aquifer through the layer of fine-grained sediments that directly underlie the peatland, are expected to provide ""windows"" of seepage. Where partial drainage of peatland occurs the ecosystem will change, notably the vegetation patterns. DeBeers has made a substantial financial contribution to a research project which aims to explore and document the hydrogeological linkages between the surface (peatland) and deep (limestone) aquifer systems. The current proposal builds on that research by 1) examining in more detail the peatland drainage systems (water table, soil moisture, flow pathways) so we can construct a water budget that includes a range of peatland types; 2) investigating the mercury dynamics in this system, since we suspect that the disturbance will cause methylization of the naturally occurring mercury, hence its liberation into surface waters; and 3) expanding the scale of disturbance-monitoring with the addition of a remote sensing component which will detect changes in water-sensitive vegetation communities and peatland surface configurations - and thus allow us to interpret the broader impacts and responses of the mining activity.

Surface waters of the open sea contain some of the lowest concentrations of dissolved metals of any environment.  Most of the metals are essential for plankton, as co-factors of enzymes and redox proteins involved in cellular metabolism.  They catalyze reactions and chemical transformations that are critical parts of all of the major biogeochemical cycles on Earth.  Iron (Fe), one of the least soluble metals in seawater, is a limiting resource for phytoplankton in the contemporary ocean.  Its low concentration restricts carbon (C) production, influences community structure and function, and affects the cycling of other metals and macronutrients.  Discovering the processes that influence Fe availability and utilization are key to understanding the ecology of the Fe-limited sea. This knowledge will inform us of how the ocean functions biologically and how it may respond to change in the future. The objectives of the research are: 1) to study how autotrophic and heterotrophic plankton acquire trace metals and adapt and acclimate when they are limiting, 2) to determine the dominant roles that these metals play in cellular metabolism, and 3) to identify the symptoms and consequences (ecological and biogeochemical) of metal limitation in the sea.  This proposal addresses three important topics that relate to the objectives: 1) How widespread is Cu substitution for Fe in oceanic diatoms?, 2) How prevalent is Cu limitation in the sea and how does it affect Cu and Fe uptake by phytoplankton?, and 3) How does Fe-limitation affect the requirements of phytoplankton for other metals and their abilities to tolerate oxidative stress?  The work will contribute to our understanding of how Fe regulates plankton production in the sea and the ways in which organisms adapt and compete for this limiting resource.

"This research aims to elucidate some of the processes involved in the formation of mountain belts as exemplified by the Canadian Cordillera. The focus is on the origin and evolution of the Cordilleran foreland thrust-and-fold belt in southern Canada and northern Montana, which formed during convergence between ancestral North America and subduction zones along its western margin. The thrust-and-fold belt consists of sheets and slices of supracrustal strata that have been scraped off the under-riding ancestral North American continent and its western margin by an over-riding tectonic collage of accreted, mainly ocean-basin, volcanic rocks called ""Intermontane terrane"". The research involves preparation of ""restored"" paleogeological structure sections and maps that portray the supracrustal rocks in the locations and configurations in which they existed prior to the thrusting and the folding. Three deep sedimentary basins from which most of the displaced rocks came (Belt-Purcell, Windermere, and Cordilleran miogeocline) will be restored to their original relationships with each other and with the deep crustal structures in the Paleoproterozoic basement of North America that extends under the Cordillera. The reconstructions will be based mainly on geological maps and balanced deep structure sections. Five additional 1:50,000-scale geologic maps, with structure sections and two new regional. deep, balanced structure sections will be completed from available field data to close a critical information gap in the centre of the region. Deep seismic imaging, together with gravity and magnetic anomaly maps, geological maps, and thermochronometric and geobarometric data from metamorphic and igneous rocks will provide constraints on regional and temporal variations in deformation and on the deep crustal and lithospheric structure. Preliminary analyses indicate that the cumulative displacement across the belt is >300 km. The results of this research can be expected to clarify how, when, and why the southeastern Canadian Cordillera and its rich fossil fuel and mineral resources formed, and also to inform the many people whose fascination with the Rockies arouses their curiousity about the mountains came to be.

"The main theme of the research presented in this proposal is vibrations and instabilities of flexible structures caused by fluid forces, and particularly where the structural motion arise as a result of interactions between the structural dynamics and the fluid forces generated thereby. Two specific problems will be examined: bluff bodies in cross-flow and aeroelastically-induced instabilities of aircraft structures.



The first problem, bluff bodies in cross-flow, is motivated by industrial problems occurring in a variety of situations, such as: heat exchanger tube arrays, overhead conductor bundles and offshore structures. The primary objective is to understand the mechanisms leading to flow-induced vibrations and instabilities and provide guidelines for designers and/or operators of such equipment. Existing work has shown that to develop reliable analytical models of these fluid-structure interactions requires a much better understanding than presently exists for the unsteady interstitial fluid mechanics of groups of cylinders in cross-flow. This is one of the primary aims of this research, it will be achieved using both experimental investigations and numerical simulations. This work will lead to a better understanding of the unsteady fluid mechanics in cylinder arrays, and hence, to superior modeling of the concomitant fluidelastic instabilities.



The aeroelastic investigations are centred around the effect of nonlinearities on the aeroelastic response of airfoils. The main objectives are to investigate the efficacy of existing techniques for aeroelastic parameter identification, and to develop new and improved methodologies. A combination of experimental and numerical methods will be used to pursue this project. The ultimate aim of this work is to develop improved flight test techniques for the identification of flutter boundaries for aircraft which possess structural nonlinearities.

"Supernovae are among the most energetic transient objects in the Universe.  They briefly outshine entire galaxies of stars, and are responsible for the formation of almost all of the elements heavier than helium. They dominate the energetics of the interstellar medium. Type Ia supernovae are the most accurate distance indicators for external galaxies.



The Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and its outstanding imaging detector, MegaCam, are being used to study supernovae at large distances and lookback times. These supernovae, observed as part of the CFHT Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), provide a superb tool with which to determine the topology and equation of state of the Universe, and have already yielded the best determination of any team on the nature of the mysterious ""dark energy"" (not to be confused with dark matter) that dominates the mass-energy of the Universe.  At the same time, SNLS supernovae provide, for the first time, a strong constraint on the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, and also an understanding of the recently discovered dependence of Type Ia supernova rate on star formation rate.



In this proposal we will explore the many implications of the recently developed ""white dwarf lifetime"" model that explains the dependence of supernova rate on star formation rate. We will also extend the our work to Type II supernovae, whose progenitors are massive stars undergoing core collapse at the end of their lives.  Type II supernovae offer us the opportunity to study the cosmic star formation rate over the past two thirds of the age of the Universe.  Finally we will study the systematics of supernovae in different galaxy environments (clusters, radio galaxies, far infrared emitters). Observational work will make use of data both from the SNLS survey currently approaching completion, and new surveys.

"Besides offering mechanical support and absorbing water and nutrients from the soil, plant root help to sense and respond to soil environment. Plant root often respond to biotic and/or abiotic cues by secreting a mixture of chemical compounds commonly referred to as root exudates. One group of organisms that interact with plant roots in the rhizosphere (the soil zone extending to a few millimeters immediately surrounding the root) is bacteria, a group consisting of both pathogenic and beneficial forms. Chemical components present in the root exudates affect the growth and physiology of bacteria, implying a dynamic interaction between rhizosphere bacteria and the plant root. The chemical components and the biological functions of the root exudates on pathogenic and beneficial root-bacteria interaction, and the genetic basis of the interactions are largely unknown. The proposed research program will use the existing vast genetic resource of Arabidopsis thaliana to identify components in the root exudates that promote colonization by beneficial Pseudomonas putida and those that repel pathogenic Pseduomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000. Furthermore, this program will unravel the genetic basis of root-microbe interactions. In the short term, chemical analysis of root exudates and associated gene expression will lead to the development of metabolic and molecular markers that could be used to identify genotypes that selectively encourage the population of beneficial bacteria in the rhizosphere. Taken together, this research program will add considerable new knowledge to our current understanding of rhizosphere plant-microbe interactions.

"Future advances in technology will depend on the reliability and further miniaturization of electronic and communication devices down to nanoscale size and on the development of new materials for applications in nanotechnology, medical sciences, sensors, etc. The proposed research is aimed at these broad needs, but focuses on two projects, in particular: i) improvements to the operation and understanding of the Damascene process used to fabricate copper-based microelectronic devices in the semiconductor industry and ii) development of new processes to produce shape memory alloys for use in a wide variety of applications such as actuators, switches, thermostats and medical devices including stents, vena-cava filters, orthodontal braces and eyeglass frames. The common approach in both projects is the use of electrodeposition of metal and alloy coatings. Electrodeposition is an attractive alternative to more established techniques such as chemical vapour deposition, melting and casting since it is generally cheaper and more flexible, can operate under milder conditions, provides more precise control over part shape and more efficient use of metal being deposited.



The Damascene process is a relatively new technique by which copper is electrodeposited over a pre-patterned silica wafer to completely fill sub-micron features without any defects. This is possible due to the addition of various chemical reagents to the plating bath. The first project is aimed at better understanding the role of these additives on the dynamics of copper deposition and the development of mathematical models to describe deposit growth in the sub-micron features during the Damascene process. The second project is aimed at developing an electroplating method to produce Fe-Mn-based alloys for use as shape memory alloys. These are ""smart materials"" that can ""remember"" their original geometry due to reversible crystal transformations they undergo under the influence of temperature and stress or magnetic field. To date, melting and casting has been the principal method to produce these materials.

"Sexual selection is an important force behind diversification of sexually reproducing organisms.  Much research has examined the benefit to females of selecting males with particular attributes (e.g., males with bright colours may have 'good genes' that can be passed on to the female's offspring), but there is also a less mutually beneficial side to sexual selection.  Sexual conflict occurs when there are different benefits to males and females of repeated matings, timing of mating, or fertilization of eggs.  Species differ in potential for both female choice and sexual conflict based on proximity of male and female at the time of sperm transfer.  For species with little or no contact (e.g., marine animals with broadcast spawning of gametes), potential for intrasexual selection is low.  For those with close contact (e.g., animals that copulate), it is likely to be high, and can influence evolution of behaviour and morphology of structures involved in sperm transfer.  

     Most sexual selection studies have involved groups in which all species in the group transfer sperm via copulation (e.g., insects, spiders, birds, mammals).  For most of these, male genitalia are external and easy to examine, whereas internal female structures must be dissected to be seen.  In this application I propose to explore aspects of sexual selection, including sexual conflict, in two groups of mites that differ greatly from the taxa typically targeted in such studies.  The first group, water mites, exhibit a huge range of sperm-transfer modes, from direct copulation to complete dissociation in which males and females never meet.  Males of the second group, feather mites, all transfer sperm directly via an aedeagus (penis).  Internal genitalia of female feather mites are visible through the body wall, allowing easy comparison of male and female genitalic structure.  The unusual diversity and morphology of these two mite lineages will allow me to test hypotheses intractable in most other animals, including: (1) consequences of evolving copulation, (2) evidence for sexual conflict in morphology of male and female genitalia, (3) evolution of courtship complexity and female morphology in closely related (congeneric) species that either do or do not transfer sperm via intromission.

"Changes in body composition, i.e. lean muscle and fat, can occur independent of any significant changes in body weight. Since alterations in body composition can be significantly affected by metabolic and immunological variables in our long term diet, exercise, hormone and studies it is necessary to measure changes in body composition in the same animal over the duration of the study. The advantage of using this powerful technique allows us to determine if changes to the type of body tissue are a direct effect of the experimental manipulation, i.e. diet, or an indirect effect related to changes in body composition. We currently do not possess the technology necessary to make repeated, non-invasive measures of body composition in small animals in our studies. The acquisition of this technology will significantly enhance the excellence in quality and capacity of our data collection and increase the standard of HQP training in our internationally renowned nutrition group.

Consequently, here we request funding for a Bruker Optics MiniSpec LF90II for small animals. This device allows for the rapid (~2 minutes/animal), accurate and non-invasive determination of body fat, lean tissue and total body water in both rats and mice. Compared to dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), considered the gold standard of body composition analysis, the MiniSpec LF90II has been shown to be more precise and accurate. This device will benefit numerous research programs directly on our campus and national/international collaborators, as well as  significantly increase our capacity to compete on the world stage in this area.","Medical equipment and apparatus","University of Alberta",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)",Nutrition,"Sciences de la vie li�es � la sant� publique et aux maladies humaines"

"Switch-mode power supplies (SMPS) are highly efficient power processing devices providing regulated voltage or current for virtually all electronic applications today. In low-power (LP) devices analog-controlled SMPS operating at switching frequencies between several hundreds of kHz and several MHz have been preferred to more flexible and intelligent digital-controlled solutions. Applications include portable and consumer electronics, computers, lighting system, and numerous other devices consuming power from a fraction to several hundreds of watts. The prevalence of the analog designs comes from the requirements for a fast controller action and simple implementation that, at the high switching frequencies, are challenging to achieve with conventional digital systems. 



Through recent research, enabling technologies for digital control of LP SMPS have been developed. In addition to that, novel features, such as parameter extraction and consequent auto-tuning, have been introduced, giving significant advantage to digital over analog solutions. 



The proposed research goes beyond the sole controller implementation and addresses the operation of the entire digitally-controlled LP SMPS, i.e. power stage and its controller, as well as its interaction with supplied digital loads. The ultimate goal is to fully utilize advantages of digital control and create a new generation of low-power reconfigurable SMPS topologies that, compared to existing solutions, will have higher power processing efficiency, smaller dimensions, higher flexibility, and improved reliability. To provide those benefits, the reconfigurable SMPS will dynamically change their own topology, depending on the power source conditions and estimated load needs, or through communication with the same.

"Orbifolds form a mathematical tool which can be used to study certain types of symmetry. Tilings of the plane such as created by the Dutch artist M.C. Escher and crystals are two well-known examples of this kind of symmetry. These examples have in common that the local symmetry is finite. There are finitely many crystals grouped together around any corner of the crystal and there are finitely many tiles with the motive coming together in any center of symmetry of the tiling. In two dimensions there are two basic types of symmetry patterns: purely rotational or a combination of rotations and reflections as in a snowflake. Several types of symmetry may be combined as one can see in the case of crystals.

    In order to study this type of symmetry it is useful to consider the so-called quotient of the pattern. This quotient is obtained by 'folding' the pattern so that corresponding motives come on top of one another. E.g., for a snowflake the quotient is a thirty degree circle sector. One could think of this circle segment as generating the symmetry; if one wants to cut a snow-flake pattern out of paper, one needs to fold the paper to obtain a thirty degree circle sector and the cut pattern in the folded paper will generate the symmetric pattern of the snowflake. The quotient of a crystal consists of the asymmetric unit of the crystal where one has to identify sides which correspond to each other under the symmetry.

    Dr. Satake introduced the concept of orbifolds in 1956. They have since been used in mathematics, physics (string theory) and crystallography. My research is focussed on the foundational questions: what properties do orbifolds have and how can we characterize different types of orbifolds? The questions I ask are influenced by the applications in physics and crystallography. The methods I use to describe orbifolds and other objects with symmetry come from category theory. Where mathematics is used to abstract some of the properties of the physical world to obtain models that can be used in a variety of situations, category theory is used to abstract even further and develop theories and constructions that can be applied in several areas of mathematics.

"We request funds to be able to perform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) studies at pressures between 1 bar and 2000 bar. The one-of-a-kind apparatus at the University of Toronto would be installed in an existing protein NMR facility and used by various researchers. Temperature and pressure are critically useful parameters in structure studies of macromolecules and proteins. Our main research interests include photo-switchable proteins and membrane proteins. In both cases, we may describe the proteins in terms of a ground state and one or more low-lying excited states. The excited states and excited state intermediates are often associated with the active form of the protein and are often the most elusive to understand. The application of a technique called NMR dispersion spectroscopy allows us to tease out the energy landscape associated with the protein and its excited state(s). By repeating these measurements as a function of pressure we can learn fundamental information about how the excited states are constructed. The apparatus permits us to make great leaps in our current research (e.g. specific volumes and compressibilities of excited states, water penetration of folded proteins, new information on photoswitchable proteins) and study pressure-dependent phenomena by high resolution NMR. We also believe that that the apparatus will forge new collaborations and establish new research niches for the applicants.","Physical sciences","University of Toronto",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","Chimie biophysique","Chimie physique"
"The human genome encodes over 800 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) - a superfamily of membrane proteins responsible for signalling and targetted by over 50% of pharmaceuticals. We propose to develop a protocol for monitoring GPCR membrane protein misfolding and determining the binding site of pharmacophores, using 19F Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The protocol entails new strategies for protein expression, new (19F) labeling protocols (including site-directed mutants involving parafluorphenylalanine), and approaches to determine topology and structure through inter-helix distance measurements. Most of this work will be focused on two integral membrane proteins (DAGK and V2R) which are expressed in E coli. The use of fluoro-tryptophan is key in studying misfolding and drug binding sites since tryptophans are typically located at the membrane water interface, and local chemical shift perturbations from pharamcophore binding can thus be registered. 19F shifts and relaxation rates are exquisitely sensitive to local structure and the presence of water- or membrane soluble paramagnetic additives. The combination of paramagnetic shift or rate measurements from both dissolved O2 and water soluble paramagnetic additives provides a simple way to probe local topology (immersion depth, solvent exposure, exposed surface area and local dynamics). Much of the proposed research will be bolstered by extensive membrane model studies and work with soluble proteins (ubiquitin, Mesd, calmodulin, and drkN SH3), some of which is more suited to advanced undergraduate students. Finally, an additional area of research entails new work with paramagnetic nanoparticles (NPs), consisting of gadolinium and fluorine (GdF3) and coated with polyacrylic acid. These NPs give rise to the highest known paramagnetic relaxation rates for MRI contrast agents and are directly applicable as contrast agents for Computed Tomography. Our goal is to develop the GdF3 NPs for targeted imaging and explore their potential as anticancer agents, when appropriately doped with radionuclides.

"The goal of this project is to continue the development of advanced engineering tools integrating the Optimization Theory with recent progress in mathematical and computational modeling of complex, multi-physics processes involved in industrial welding. We will apply and further elaborate the advances made during an earlier project. In particular, we intend to develop an improved suite of computational tools that will allow research engineers to (i) create optimal input process parameter schedules (speed, current, power, etc.) for the Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding process; these schedules will also ensure minimal heat input and, consequently, minimal material  distortion, (ii) perform estimation of certain unknown parameters of the model (e.g., solution-dependent material properties) based on experimental measurements; actual values of material properties are often difficult to obtain, hence suitably performed parameter estimation will likely improve fidelity of computational modelling. This interdisciplinary research project will be carried out jointly by Dr. Protas' group at McMaster University, which will bring mathematical and computational expertise, and General Motors of Canada (GM) which will contribute engineering expertise. We will also closely interact with physicists from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia who will be working with GM on a related problem. During the course of the project we will provide interdisciplinary training, involving elements of applied and computational mathematics as well as physics and applied engineering science, to a graduate student and a post-doctoral fellow to be recruited to work full-time on this project. The results of this project may have the generic effect of improving the joining technology used in various sectors of the manufacturing industry and may therefore exert a positive influence on the Canadian economy. For example, the optimization methodology developed in this project could be used by GM to improve the joining technology of its vehicles assembled at the GM plant in Oshawa, ON. This project will also create opportunities for Dr. Protas' group to make contributions at the forefront of academic research.

"The proposed research will address a range of topics that bridge the theoretical and computational fluid mechanics with the modern theory of control and optimization. Our goal is to develop and validate a suite of advanced computational methods for a number of fundamental problems in this field. The theoretical foundations established by this project will provide the basis for more applied investigations to be pursued in the future. In one part of the proposed effort we will revisit vortex-based models for inviscid and incompressible flows characterized by continuous vorticity distributions, such as vortex patches and vortex sheets. These models are relevant for understanding the mechanisms of hydrodynamic propulsion important, for instance, for fish-like locomotion. Our research will add new value to these classical models by providing a suite of tools for solution of control and optimization problems formulated based on such models. In another part of the proposed effort we will extend the methods of control and optimization to flow phenomena involving multiphysics effects and featuring interfaces and contact lines. Such flows are ubiquitous as models in a number of important industrial applications. Mathematically, all of these phenomena are described as 'free-boundary problems' in which the shape of the domain must be determined as a part of the solution. This fact has far-reaching consequences for the mathematical formulation of inverse problems for such systems. As a result, one is required to develop special approaches combining classical methods of applied mathematics with a number of novel techniques. In addition, in this investigation we will also seek to make contributions to some outstanding problems in classical hydrodynamics concerning flows past obstacles. The funding provided by this grant will allow Dr. Protas to train several graduate students in interdisciplinary research rooted in applied mathematics and involving also elements of scientific computing, physics and engineering science.

L'objectif g�n�ral de la recherche du candidat est d'avancer l'�tat des connaissances sur le comportement dynamique des ouvrages de g�nie civil (barrages, ponts, b�timents) et donc de r�aliser des structures plus s�curitaires. Les objectifs sp�cifiques � long terme sont de d�velopper des m�thodes de r�habilitation sismique et de contr�le des vibrations qui seront appliqu�es sur des structures r�elles. Dans le cas des barrages, des m�thodes de mod�lisation sismique pour �tude de s�curit� sismiques seront d�velopp�es et valid�es � partir de donn�es enregistr�es sur des grands barrages lors de s�ismes r�els. Dans le cas des b�timens, une nouvelle technique de contr�le des vibrations par dissipateur d'�nergie visco�lastique sera d�velopp�e et test�e sur un mod�le r�duit avec une table sismique. Enfin, une approche bas�e sur les courbes de fragilit� sera propos�e pour d�treminer la vuln�rabilit� sismique des ponts et viaducs, ce qui permettra de s�lectionner une structure type et d'�valuer des techniques de r�habilitation sismique en laboratoire.

"Membranes processes are one of the most promising domains for gas or water treatment because they are relevant from environment friendly processes and contribute to enhance green chemistry protocols by recovery of byproducts. Compared with polymer membranes -that represents at least 95% of the market-, ceramic membranes, which are already developed at the industrial level, offer improved properties in term of durability, chemical resistance or resistance to abrasion

However, the main drawback of the ceramic membranes is their cost of production resulting from a multi-steps fabrication that requires large handling and a significant rate of defective membranes. They are produced from colloidal solutions of inorganic particles obtained by a controlled hydrolysis/ condensation process starting from metal alkoxides M(OR)n. These precursors are always expensive and the colloidal suspensions that are obtained are not always stable with time, which can prevent them to be fully used and contribute to increase the overall cost.

We intend to explore new pathways of membranes production through two complementary ways that would allow us to reduce the total cost of production. Firstly, we will take as starting materials, ceramic nanopowders produced by industrial processes, in place of the colloidal suspensions prepared from alkoxides. We will study (i) the stability and dispersion of these powders in aqueous solvents and (ii) the obtention of porous ceramic bodies from these powders. Secondly we will explore an innovative route for the preparation of inorganic membranes: instead of natural deposition, we will explore the influence of pressure-helped stacking of particles. To this purpose, the core of the tube will contain a system that can be inflated in order to push the colloidal suspension through the porous support. Our expectation is to take advantage of the forced diffusion to increase the raw density of the stacked layer, facilitates its further densification and overcome the inherent defects of the support in order to decrease the rate of defects.

"The proposed research will explore and develop a new class of continuum models --coined ""phase-field-crystal models""-- for quantitative modeling of solidification phenomena in multi-component alloys. The unique advantage of these models is that they are atomically resolved in space but operate on time scales many orders of magnitudes longer than current molecular dynamics. They contain, on the one hand, an intimate connection to atomic-scale properties of matter, through their connection with classical density functional theory. On the other hand, their dynamics is course-grained in time, which makes it possible to simulate many aspects of elasto-plasticity, grain boundary interactions and topological defects on the same [diffusive] time scales that govern phase transformation kinetics. This work will begin by deriving a suite of phase-field-crystal models for multi-component alloys that are linked to direct correlations functions computed from molecular dynamics and analytical methods. These models will be used, in their own right to study the interplay of thermodynamics, crystal defects and elasticity on several important applications involving nano-microstructure evolution in materials science, which have been typically inaccessible to traditional phase field theory and molecular dynamics.  In addition, the proposed research will extend and further develop mathematical and numerical methods to course-grain the new alloy phase-field-crystal models to higher length scales. This will have the advantage of guiding the formation of improved (i.e. quantitative) traditional phase field models for use on higher scales.  The research will provide a high level of scientific and applied training in materials science and engineering for two graduate students.

"The human genome contains ~35,000 genes, from which more than ~200,000 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) can be derived. These mRNAs have the potential of encoding more than ~2,000,000 different proteins, the main constituents of cells. Recent studies have unveiled the existence and biological significance of a gene regulatory mechanism based on tiny RNA species called microRNAs. Expressed in almost all living eukaryotes, microRNAs may regulate up to 92% of the genes! This observation suggests that every metabolic processes may be under microRNA control in all cells and tissues of the human body. 

       Of central importance in microRNA biogenesis is Dicer, an enzyme of the ribonuclease III (RNase III) family that we discovered and characterized in its recombinant form. Strategically positioned at the nuclear/cytoplasmic interface, Dicer would accept its microRNA precursor (pre-microRNA) substrate of nuclear origin from the transporter Exportin-5, recognize it via its central PIWI/Argonaute/Zwille (PAZ) domain and release microRNAs through the concerted action of its RNase IIIa and IIIb motifs. Despite its central importance in microRNA biogenesis, the cellular context in which Dicer functions in RNA silencing still remains poorly understood.

       In this proposal, we wish to address that issue by elucidating the protein interaction network of human Dicer, which is very likely to regulate its function in microRNA biosynthesis and function such as, among others, enzyme activity, substrate recognition and specificity, intracellular localization/transport, stability and ability to interact with other proteins. Expected to lend an additional level of complexity to the mechanisms regulating the human genome, our findings may provide a better understanding of the cellular role and function of Dicer, which is a prerequisite for identifying genetic diseases possibly linked to alterations in Dicer function or caused by malfunctioning of the microRNA-guided RNA silencing machinery.

"I am planning to develop efficient semiparametric approaches to univariate and multivariate regression and density estimation and to study related convergence issues. A recently proposed differentiated logdensity approximant, which turns out to possess numerous desirable properties, requires further investigation. I shall extend my results on the distribution of the distance between random points located in rectangles, polygons and parallelepipeds to random points located in  polygonal pyramids, and consider certain applications to transportation logistics, such as those associated with intercity traffic and the positioning of airtankers. Further developments on generalized distributions should lead to more efficient techniques in reliability analysis and quality control. The Bayesian predictive approach will be used to make inferences in connection with problems arising in the biomedical fields, and in particular, in statistical genetics. Extensions of the published distributional results in Time Series to general ARMA models are also being investigated. I intend to explore an alternative structural representation of elliptically contoured distributions; promising applications include the modelling of time series with thick-tailed distributed innovations as well as the development of efficient alternative techniques for simulating functions involving elliptically contoured vectors, among others. I shall develop efficient algorithms for determining the distribution function of indefinite quadratic forms in singular elliptically contoured or complex random vectors. I shall make the code associated with several of my results available on Wolfram's website. I am also preparing monographs on density estimation and Hermitian quadratic forms. Finally, I am aiming to complete a textbook on multivariate statistical analysis with the addition of chapters on classification, multivariate analysis of variance and generalized linear models.

"Freshwater ice is an integral component of cold-regions lakes and rivers and an important modifier of related biological, chemical and physical processes.   Although serious concerns have been expressed about the impacts of climate change on ice-covered systems (e.g., the recent assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment), knowledge of such systems is relatively weak making it difficult to predict the nature of the effects of a changing climate.  This project will focus on filling some of our most important knowledge gaps by addressing three research areas: extreme hydrologic events; climatic controls; and effects on hydro-ecological systems.

The focus of extreme hydrologic events will be river-ice breakup and associated ice jamming.  Such events can produce floods exceeding those possible under similar flow during the open-water period.  Although breakup flooding is known to produce significant economic damage and also to be critical to the environmental health of aquatic systems, no broad-scale assessment of its importance has been conducted.  This study will fill this gap by conducting a national and circumpolar evaluation of the historical frequency and magnitude of breakup floods and compare the results to those for the open-water period.  This will provide a basis for improved infrastructure planning and environmental management, as well as be the basis for the second objective of this research program: predicting how the frequency and magnitude of such extreme events will be affected by future climate change.   

Major changes in river and lake ecology, particularly including the water quality, are also expected to result from climate-induced changes to river-ice cover.  Projected ecological changes, however, have been based primarily on guesstimates of changes in the ice cover, not on the results of physically-based models.  The final objective of this program will be to undertake such modelling so that we can more accurately forecast how northern aquatic systems will respond to climate change.

"Freshwater ice is an integral component of northern rivers and an important modifier of related biological, chemical and physical processes.   Although many concerns have been expressed about the potential impacts of climate change on ice-covered systems, our knowledge base remains relatively weak thereby making it difficult to predict the nature and magnitude of the effects of a changing climate on ice-covered systems.   Moreover, even basic information on river-ice systems in northern Canada has been a problem for proper assessment of the potential environmental impact of development, including  oil and gas development along the Mackenzie River and most recently directly within the Mackenzie River Delta.  Although river-ice breakup is known to create the dominant hydrologic event of the year in the Delta and is essential to its ecological health, there is a lack of information about how variations in climate have controlled the timing, severity and intra-delta spatial dimensions of such events.  Moreover, little is know what effects future climate will produce.

    )	This project focuses on filling some of our most important knowledge gaps with the following objectives:

i.    )	quantify the detailed spatial and temporal variations in river ice breakup within the Mackenzie River Delta;

ii.    )	establish the significance of breakup events, as measured by magnitude and recurrence interval, to annual flow events produced under open-water conditions within the delta;

iii.    )	quantify the relationship between temporal changes in river-ice breakup timing and severity with major controlling hydrologic and climatic conditions that affect the forces driving breakup (e.g., flood wave) and factors resisting breakup (e.g., ice thickness and mechanical strength), and

iv.    )	relate the major controlling hydro-climatic conditions to atmospheric circulation patterns.

    )	The related long-term objective of the proposed research is to predict how the timing and magnitude of extreme breakup events will be affected by climate-change induced modifications of major temperature and precipitation patterns.

"How organisms acquire their form is a fascinating basic research problem in developmental biology. The form of an organism is largely determined by its genetic makeup, yet molecular-level phenomena do not control form directly. Instead, they set the stage for a cascade of developmental processes, which take place at different levels of plant organization and eventually yield the final form. These emergent processes are increasingly studied using data-driven computational models, simulations, and visualizations, which complement and help interpret the results of biological experiments. In the general scope of these studies, my research is focused on:



A. Model-based studies of plant development.  In collaboration with experimental biologists, I am seeking common mechanisms that underlie diverse developmental processes in plants.  Our work is driven be the hypothesis that several key aspects of plant development and form can be explained in terms of the pattern-generating properties of the plant hormone auxin.  



B. Advancement of mathematical and computational techniques for the modeling of development.  In this part of my research program, my students and I devise techniques that can be incorporated into simulation software. This software can then be used to create visual simulation models that provide insights into the mechanisms of plant development in nature.



I am also organizing elements of biology, mathematics, and computer science into a coherent framework, the ""computational biology of plant development.""  This synthesis is needed as a systematic account of the results obtained to date, as a stepping stone for further research, and as a vehicle for transmitting ideas to the next generation of researchers and students.

"Wireless personal communication has emerged as a key technology that dramatically impacts our society. Wireless cellular and local area networks are currently experiencing significant growth driven by a strong market interest for highly mobile, widely accessible, multimedia communications. To address the ever-increasing consumer needs and demands, current research on wireless communications strives to: (i) Increase Capacity (i.e., increase number of mobile clients in a given geographical area); (ii) Reduce complexity (both hardware and software); (iii) Improve performance through intelligent processing at the receiver and/or transmitter. The short and long-term growth of consumer-based mobile and portable communication systems is tied closely to the achievement of the above four objectives. 



This research focuses on the investigation of new algorithms that achieve the previously mentioned goals. Special emphasis  is given in the development of algorithms that exhibit improved performance in realistic wireless communications environments. More specifically, this research focuses on the design and analysis of low-complexity reception and highly accurate parameter estimation algorithms, specifically for realistic non-stationary wireless environments where, due to rapid changes in the user population and the physical characteristics of the environment, the size of the data record available for receiver adaptation and parameter estimation is limited.

"This proposal is directed toward acquisition of an analytical instrument for the analysis of trace concentrations of mercury in water. This instrument will support a rapidly growing research program focused on the development of novel technologies to reduce the flux of mercury to the environment. There are numerous locations in the world where mercury has been released to the environment due to past industrial activities, resulting in accumulation of mercury in soils and sediments. This mercury can then be released slowly over many decades, continuously entering the food chain. Because of the very high toxicity of mercury, there is increasing regulatory pressure around the world to limit the release of mercury from contaminated sites to very low concentrations. Our research program is directed at developing cost effective management approaches to minimize the release of this highly toxic contaminant and prevent uptake into biota. Studies are being conducted to assess the effectiveness of stabilization techniques, which limit the long-term release of mercury to the environment. These techniques involve co-blending reactive media with mercury contaminated sediments and soils to minimize release of mercury and its transformations. The equipment requested will provide analyses of very low concentrations of mercury in an automated, rapid manner by employing gold concentration followed by cold-vapour atomic fluorescence. The equipment will provide analyses in the sub nanogram per liter range. These low detection limits are required to evaluate whether the proposed stabilization approaches can effectively control mercury at concentrations that are protective of the environment.",Environment,"University of Waterloo",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","G�ochimie environnementale","G�ochimie et g�ochronologie"
"Mercury is a highly toxic metal released to the environment through natural and anthropogenic activities. At many sites, efforts are underway to remediate soils and sediments with elevated mercury, primarily to minimize ecosytem damage and to protect fisheries. The costs associated with such remediation efforts can be exceedingly high, therefore there is a desire to develop low cost methods to treat mercury contaminated soils and sediment. This project focuses on delineation of treatment options for mercury contaminated sediments. Experiments will be conducted to assess various remediation approaches using sediments obtained from a site contaminated through past industrial activities. The contaminated sediments will be stabilized prior to ex situ deposition to minimize Hg leaching to soil and groundwater. Particular emphasis of the study will be placed on delineation of long-term leaching of Hg through the use of experiments which are designed to assess reactions under accelerated weathering conditions. The results of the experiments are expected to benefit industry through potential cost savings. If applied to the site scale, Hg fluxes will be reduced, leading to environmental improvements, and potentially reductions in exposure.

"In recent years, modern information systems have evolved in fundamental ways. As opposed to the traditional client-server architecture of data warehouses, modern informations systems consists of large volumes of distributed data sources, all connected by the Internet.  Aside from being distributed, the data sources are also evolving, with their schemas updated frequently and asynchronously.  Today's information systems are also heterogeneous.  Beyond traditional databases, there is an emergence of novel sources of data.  They include real-time streamed data, data services, sensor and radio frequency identification (RFID) readings.



  The proposed research program is on developing techniques for resilient user applications in the presence of asynchronous schema updates.  We will develop techniques to allow user applications and queries to automatically adapt to evolving schema of heterogeneous data sets.  These techniques will also enable mission critical applications to limit the evolution of remote databases with minimal restriction to ensure correct and uninterrupted data access.  The proposed techniques will take into account the unique characteristics of novel data sources such as web services, data streams, and sensor/RFID data.



  The proposed program will also study the problem of autonomic storage and exchange of heterogeneous data in distributed information systems.  Our objective is to design efficient layouts for storage and exchange

for unstructured or semi-structured data sets or data streams.  By analyzing the data to be stored or exchanged, we will develop algorithms to automatically design the storage and exchange layout that efficiently make use of available database systems and network resources.  Aside from static data sets, we are particularly interested at data storage and exchange problem for evolving data sets and data streams.

"The birth of stars and planets is the overarching theme of my research program. Stars typically form in stellar clusters within turbulent, magnetized clouds of gas. How do these clusters end up with a well-defined, and possibly universal distribution of stellar masses (the so-called initial mass function, or IMF)? Dense regions of gas within such forming clusters collapse to form gaseous protostellar disks, which can form single or binary stars.  What properties do these disks have?  Do the energetic outflows that appear to be associated with the disks have some role in limiting the mass of the stars that form within them?  It is well known that these protostellar disks are the birth regions for planetary systems as well - so by studying the disks we can  follow the growth of planets from these earliest times. 

     The current revolution in planetary discovery has turned up nearly 300 planets, and dozens of exo-planetary systems.  How can one account for the mass spectrum of exo-planets as well as the unexpected distribution of their orbital radii (hot Jupiter-sized planets revolve at orbits well within 1 Astronomical Unit of their host stars)?  Forming planets can interact with the surrounding gas in a disk through tidal forces, and by this means, can rapidly migrate through disks.  What prevents them from plunging into their central stars?

      We use specially developed computer codes using an Adaptive Mesh algorithm and include gravitational as well as magnetic forces and dust cooling. This enables us to follow the formation of stars and planets over 8 decades in physical scale.  Our computer simulations will allow us to follow the formation of stars from initial turbulence in such magnetized clouds, and predict their masses.   We can then follow the evolution of disks including the launch of jets from their surfaces, and the dust settling within them that ultimately gives rise to planets.  Our calculations will track the evolution of rocky planets and massive gaseous planets as they accrete and migrate within these disks.  This research will lead to a deeper understanding of how stars and planets form in our Galaxy - which we shall test with many new observations - from X-rays to millimetre waves.

Phosphorite and iron formation are marine sedimentary rocks that contain important information about the development of the Earth's early oceans and the evolution of life.  They are also the primary sources of phosphorus and iron for fertilizer and steel production.  The purpose of the proposed research is to understand the relationship between phosphorite and iron formation in the Earth's distant past (~1,800 million years ago) to gain insight into how the composition of the Paleoproterozoic ocean changed through time.  On a more applied level, this research will also enhance our understanding of how to explore for and mine these deposits.

"Many studies in healthcare research follow patients over time. This allows researchers to evaluate how, for example, treatment impacts a patient's health over a number of months or years, rather than looking at just the initial response to treatment. Most research involving patients who are followed over time involves some unpredictability in the times when patients are seen by their physicians, or in the information that is gathered at each visit. Even if the researcher lays out a timeline specifying when visits should occur, patients my miss a scheduled visit, see their doctor more often when unwell, ask that a test or measurement not be taken at a particular visit, or withdraw from the study altogether. These variations in visit times and information collected at each visit are rarely completely random, and are often associated with the patient's health. If this is ignored when analysing the data, the results of the analysis can be very misleading. Work outlined in this proposal will develop methods to analyse this type of irregular data, with a focus on providing precise, unbiased answers to important healthcare questions.

"Algebraic combinatorics is the study of discrete mathematical objects using algebra.  It includes methods for solving counting problems, such as how many ways are there of writing a number as a sum of smaller numbers, or how many ways are there of tiling a region with certain shapes.  On the flip side of this, is the idea that discrete methods and algorithms can be useful in solving problems in algebra.



Algebraic geometry is a rich subject built upon the notion of geometry that is describable by equations.  Some familiar geometric objects such as circles and lines in the plane are basic examples of this.  Counting problems also arise in geometry, and in this case algebra provides the bridge between the combinatorial (discrete) side of the problem and the geometric (continuous) side.  Some of these geometric counting problems are fundamental for a number of areas of mathematics, but an understanding of their combinatorial side is often completely missing.  This proposal addresses some of the questions that have arisen out of the attempt to fill this enormous knowledge gap.

"When we speak, we use the sound of our own voice to help maintain accurate speech production. This is true for qualities of our voice such as loudness, pitch, and the sound of vowels. Without auditory feedback (after a hearing loss for example), we can lose good control of these aspects of our speech over time. There has been a significant amount of research done on the control of loudness and pitch because these properties of the voice are relatively easy to change as an individual is speaking. With very little delay, the altered voice signal is delivered over headphones and influences the ongoing speech. Changing the sound of vowels during speech is much more technically challenging, and has only been reported in a limited way by three laboratories world wide. 

The proposed research project uses a new speech processing system that I have developed to change vowels as people are speaking. Of the three devices that exist to do this, mine is the most flexible to adjust voiced vowels, and has the shortest delays in the tracking of vowel characteristics. In this project, we will study the role that hearing one's own voice has in the maintenance of vowel production. Specifically, we will investigate what aspects of the sound of the voice are important to the part of the brain responsible for using that information. Experiments will determine under what conditions does speech change to compensate for the subtle errors introduced in the headphones. Some people respond less to these changes in their voice than others, and the research will study why this is the case. The possibility that their hearing may not be as sensitive will be evaluated using hearing tests that measure the electrical activity of the brain in response to sound.



This basic research will improve our understanding of the role of auditory feedback during speech in healthy individuals. As we come to understand the system better, there will be future opportunities to develop diagnostic tools and clinical treatments.",Psychology,"University of Western Ontario",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Syst�mes sensoriels et perception",Psychologie

"Life history traits directly influence an organism's ability to pass genes to the next generation. Traits like growth rate and maturation age vary widely among- and within-species and affect harvestable yields. Understanding this variation is critical for conservation, management, and insights on adaptation. The long-term objectives of my research program are to determine the scope, hierarchical expression within-species, origins and implications of intra-specific life history variation in fishes. Three short-term objectives are outlined by this proposal.



(I) An examination of temporal changes in the life histories of capelin, herring and sand lance will address the significance of environmental perturbation and fishery induced evolution. Similar long-term temporal shifts in these species would indicate widespread mid-trophic alterations, and energy flow changes in the marine ecosystem. The absence of temporal shifts in unexploited sand lance would suggest top-down fishing mortality as a probable cause in other species. (II) Artificial fertilizations will identify local adaptation between on- and off-beach spawning capelin and spring- and autumn-spawning herring. Such genetic variation would be important for productivity and should be protected for long-term viability of species and fisheries. Barriers to fertilization among-populations would also indicate the degree to which a general phenomenon might mitigate human induced genetic homogenization. (III) Environmental effects on growth and survival are reasonably documented, but we know very little on factors influencing fertilization ability. Individual variability in sperm performance will be examined under different environmental conditions for several species. Local adaptation to spawning conditions in populations of cod and capelin will be investigated at different temperatures and salinities. Results of the sperm work will indicate evolutionary trends among-species and genetic differences among-populations that would be important to protect, and may also help improve aquaculture techniques.

"This research speaks to the development of internal structure (at the nano, micro and higher levels) in advanced engineering materials, (such as high strength alloys for light-weight automotive applications).  It is well established that internal structure at all levels has a profound influence on the useful properties of materials; the object of the proposed research is to provide a deeper understanding of the ways in which structure is developed, with a view to optimizing the processing of these materials to obtain improved properties. The research includes studies of the energetics of the materials, coupled with studies of the rates of formation of the internal patterns arising from processing.  Applications are pursued to metals, semiconductors and other useful solids.



The interactions among materials composition, materials processing (which may include mechanical working and/or thermal treatments) and the ultimate physical and chemical properties of a material are essential elements of materials design.  A recent specific example can be found in the modeling of the evolution of microstructure of micro-alloyed steels.  With my students and colleagues I developed and experimentally validated a mathematical model that incorporates the formation of sub-microscopic (niobium-carbide) particles at elevated temperature within solid steel. These nano-particles interact dynamically with internal surfaces in the steel, and with crystal defects produced by deformation, in such a way that the physical properties (e.g. strength, ductility) of the steel are profoundly affected. The resulting quantitative model is currently being evaluated by steel processors in Canada and abroad. A paper summarizing the model and its applications was recently recognized via the award of the Sawamura and Guimaraes medals by the Iron and Steel Institute of Japan.

"Skeletal muscle contractions generate the forces that allow us to interact with our environment.  The structural and functional characteristics of skeletal muscle fibres determine the nature and quality of those interactions.  Interestingly, this post-mitotic tissue possesses the unique ability to change its structural and functional properties to meet new demands placed on it by the external environment.  For example, chronic increases in activity lead to the conversion of a fast contracting (fast-twitch) muscle that fatigues rapidly into a slower contracting but fatigue resistant muscle.  Conversely, inactivity or immobilisation induces the opposite response.  There is a paucity of information regarding the events that underlie the structural and functional plasticity of skeletal muscles.  To investigate this, we use a rodent model of muscle training in which low-frequency electrical stimulation (LFS) is chronically applied to a fast-twitch muscle in order to convert it into a slow phenotype.  The capacity of this experimental model to demonstrate the full adaptive potential of skeletal muscle is unparalleled.  When combined with nutritional and drug interventions, and the study of individual molecules and cells in culture, it allows us to investigate factors that direct muscle adaptation at levels that range from a single molecule to the contractile properties of whole tissue.  The work proposed in this application will focus on revealing adaptive strategies used by skeletal muscle.  In particular, we will focus on the nature and extent of contributions made by a population of pre-mitotic muscle stem cells (satellite cells) to the adaptive process. The outcome of this work will have broad implications ranging from improving our fundamental understanding of how muscles adapt to exercise training, to enhancing the regenerative and adaptive potential of diseased and healthy human muscles.","Advancement of knowledge","University of Alberta",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Physiologie et m�tabolisme des animaux","Biologie animale"

"The objective of this proposed research program is to investigate the use of water treatment residual (WTR) solids for immobilization of soluble phosphorus (P) and application of the WTR solids for preventing P movement to surface and ground waters from wastewater lagoons, stormwater ponds, constructed treatment wetlands and landfills.  The novelty and significance of the work is the potential to utilize a waste product that would typically require disposal in a landfill for control of P release to the environment.

   The proposed research program will be conducted in three phases.  The first phase will characterize the chemical and physical properties of several representative WTR solids.  These will include WTR solids from aluminium sulphate and iron salt based coagulation water treatment systems, lime softening WTR solids, and mixtures of coagulant and lime softening WTR solids typical of plants incorporating coagulation and softening in a single reactor (Saskatoon). 

   The second phase of the program will investigate the utilization of WTR solids for retention of P within 1) the sediments of wastewater lagoons and stormwater detention ponds, 2) the granular substrate of constructed treatment wetlands, and 3) the daily cover material of landfills.  The P retention studies for lagoons and detention ponds will be conducted in laboratory bench top batch experiments.  The investigations for constructed treatment wetlands and landfills will be conducted in mesocosm and column laboratory experiments.

   The final phase of the project will be to conduct full scale field experiments in collaboration with municipalities and/or industry partners.  Municipal and industry participation and support for field studies will be sought based upon the results of the laboratory experiments.

   The research program will provide support and training for an overlapping sequence of at least three M.Sc. students over the five year duration of the grant.

"My research is devoted to the theoretical study of solvation (for example, what happens at a microscopic level when common table salt (mostly sodium chloride) is dissolved in water. Many chemical reactions are carried out in a solvent such as water or an organic liquid such as hexane. Depending on the solvent used, the products obtained can vary, because polar solvents tend to stabilize polar products such as ions (in the previous example, sodium cation and chloride anion). 

The usefulness of theoretical techniques such as traditional ab initio and density functional theory was brought to the public eye by the awarding of the 1998 Nobel prize in chemistry to Walker Kohn and John Pople. Theoretical techniques can offer profound insight into chemical phenomena that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to verify experimentally.

I propose to continue my studies of cations and anions in aqueous solution using some techniques that have recently been, or shall soon be, developed. I will also develop some tools and methods  that could help computational chemists do their jobs more easily and make the fruits of their labour more accessible to those wishing to build on their work.

"Our arteries are lined by a single layer of cells called the vascular endothelium.  Due to their position on the inside of the artery, the endothelial cells are constantly exposed to the frictional force created by the flowing blood.  Termed shear stress, this frictional force plays a key role in regulating endothelial cell responses that change artery size and stiffness in both the short and the long term.  We are interested in understanding the sensitivity of the endothelium to changes in shear stress, the speed of its responses and how these factors may differ in arteries that are in the arms vs. the legs.  We will use cutting edge Doppler ultrasound technology to measure both changes in shear stress and changes in artery size and stiffness.    In daily living, the most common cause of increases in shear stress is performing exercise.  Exercise also results in long term changes in artery function and structure, however, we do not know if these changes are brought about by increases in shear stress per se,  or other variables that change with exercise.   We will isolate the role of shear stress in changes in artery function with a novel technique that allows us to mimic exercise induced changes in shear stress without having to perform contractions.      In addition to responding to changes in shear stress, our arteries are also controlled by nerves.  Similar to the motor neurons that that stimulate our skeletal muscles to contract, the nerves that control our arteries cause the muscle in their walls to contract, making the vessel smaller.  We still do not clearly understand the ways in which responses to increases in shear stress, and responses to signals from the nerves interact when they are experienced simultaneously in the same artery.   In experiments we will manipulate both variables, and measure changes in artery size and factors in the blood that reflect neural and endothelial cell function.  This will give us important insight into the complex interaction and integration of signals in our arteries.   The information gained from these studies will assist in advancing our understanding of basic human cardiovascular function.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Queen's University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Circulation animale","Biologie animale"
"Aquatic animals live in a universal solvent.  Water has a high capacity for dissolving a range of both organic and inorganic chemicals.  As such, aquatic animals have evolved sophisticated chemical communication systems for receiving information about their surrounding environment by sensing various chemicals in the water.  These info-chemicals convey information about the location of food or predators, genetic quality and reproductive status of potential mates, location of migratory routes, and more.  Moreover, the molecular machinery used to detect and process these chemicals is conserved among taxa.  Although we have understood for over 30 years that some water contaminants, like metals, can interfere with a fish's sense of smell, we do not yet fully appreciate the extent of this contaminant-induced sensory deficit nor do we appreciate its ecological significance.  Our work involves studying metal-impaired chemosensation in animals representing different levels of a typical aquatic food web, including water fleas representing the zooplankton and primary consumers, and fishes representing predators and secondary consumers.  The goal of our work is to understand how metals interfere with chemosensation and how those effects impair vital processes like predator-avoidance, feeding, and reproduction.  By understanding metal effects on processes at the cellular or subcellular levels of biological organization, we can begin to understand how those effects propagate to higher levels of organization to become manifest at the population, community, or ecosystem levels.  Protection of aquatic environments consistently ranks highly among Canadians owing to the several recreational and economic resources these systems offer. Because this work affords us an unique opportunity to determine the extent to which chemical communication participates in essential processes that are vital to ecosystem function, we can begin to determine the extent to which human activities affect fundamental ecosystem processes. Both the regulatory and industrial communities will be interested in this work in order to develop approaches that mitigate these effects and ultimately protect ecosystems.

"The proposed research will investigate the dynamics of the active continental mantle lithosphere (i.e., sub-crustal lithosphere) and its relationship to crustal tectonics.  The mantle lithosphere makes up the largest component member of the tectonic plates, but compared to the overlying crust and fluid mantle below, its evolution is little studied and poorly understood.  The research program will make tangible advancements in our understanding of this part of the Earth by addressing questions in three environments where continental mantle lithosphere is/was tectonically active:  (1) what happens to consumed mantle lithosphere plate at a continental plate collision?; (2) How/why are large blocks of mantle lithosphere missing at various locations around the Earth?; (3) How did the different natural (atmospheric, solid Earth) environment during the Earth's infancy in the Archean change the way mantle lithosphere behaved?  The research program will try to answer these questions by a cross-disciplinary ""top-down"" methodology, wherein new and developing techniques of computational and laboratory modeling of dynamic Earth processes will be integrated with associated geological/geodetic/geophysical observational constraints.



The work is significant for exploring what is a fundamental gap in our understanding of plate tectonic processes.  The mantle lithosphere is the bridge between mantle thermal engine and tectonically active crust and as such controls how heat and stresses are transferred between the surface and planetary interior.  Also, as the site for the genesis of diamond bearing volcanic kimberlite pipes, the study of the evolution and dynamics mantle lithosphere has direct implications for understanding the development of important resources in 

Canada's mineral industry.  Across a broader frontier, the research will help decipher the geologic evolution of terrestrial planets such as Venus, Mars, Io, and Europa that seem to indicate minorly active lithospheres with geodynamic processes akin to those we will investigate in the proposed research.

The goals of this research are, to further our understanding of the fundamental properties of the particles that make up the atomic nucleus (neutrons and protons), to test our knowledge of the interactions between these particles, and to test our understanding of fundamental physics through sum rules. This will be accomplished by measurements of nuclear reactions on light nuclei that are initiated by photons and by photon scattering from the nucleus. The photon measurements will be accomplished primarily using linearly and circularly polarized photons from the High Intensity Gamma Source at the Duke University Free Electron Laser facility in Durham, North Carolina.

"Quantum technology is likely to play an important role in the 21st century. Entangled photon sources are an essential component for many quantum applications. This proposal aims to take an important step forward in the development of quantum technology for practical applications.  We propose to develop compact devices that generate entangled photon pairs for practical applications of quantum technology. Entangled photons, broadly speaking, are pairs of photons (or light ""particles"") prepared in a special state that makes them exhibit correlated properties. For example, for polarization-entangled photon pairs, the measurement of one photon's polarization state reveals that of its partner, even when they are physically far away from each other -- a phenomenon described by Einstein as ""spooky action at a distance"". Entanglement can be exploited by quantum computing and quantum communication. Entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD), for example, utilizes the correlation of the photons sent to two remote parties and allows them to share a common set of random cryptographic keys. It guarantees the security of the keys since any eavesdropping attempt would result in a detectable deterioration of correlation.  Entangled photon pairs can be generated from higher energy photons in a nonlinear optical material. In contrast to using nonlinear crystals which is expensive and incompatible with photonic platform technologies, we propose to use apply mature photonics technologies, that is, fibre-optics and semiconductor waveguides, to create entangled photons. If successful, such technologies will result in compact, robust, entangled photon sources that can be deployed directly in practical systems, and in fact, will serve as a strong driving force for the proliferation of practical quantum technologies.

     Entangled photon pairs can be generated from higher energy photons in a nonlinear optical material. Optical fibre is typically inefficient for this purpose due to its weak nonlinearity. We propose to use poled fibre, one that has been subject to a high electric field, for efficient entangled photon pair generation. Compact, robust, fiber-based sources are highly desirable for both QKD and metrology applications that use fibre for transmission or photon delivery, because they remove the need for beam alignment, eliminate coupling losses to and from fiber, and facilitate turn-key operation perfect for field deployment.

Sphere decoding is a widely used technique. We propose to investigate accurate, robust, and efficient sphere decoding methods and more general integer least squares methods. Our project will strengthen the competitiveness of Canadian digital communication industry. Students in this project will receive training in digital communication, scientific computing, numerical software engineering, and numerical analysis. Although our project focuses on the application of communications, integer least squares also has applications in cryptography and computer security.

"The objective of the proposed research is to develop numerical methods to compute the violent sloshing in Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) tank and its coupling effect on ship motion. 



The high demand of natural gas has led to dramatic changes of LNG terminals and transportation systems due to new trade routes and operational conditions. The sloshing phenomenon becomes a challenging issue in LNG carrier design, especially when LNG carriers are getting large in size and the shipping lines are demanding more flexible operating conditions such as partial filling of LNG tanks and operations in Arctic seas. In rough sea conditions, LNG ships can experience extreme loads due to sloshing. The internal sloshing flows in tanks can not only cause damages of inner hull structures, but also affect the motion of the LNG ship. 



It is important to predict the sloshing flow due to ship motion and its effect on the ship motion. The proposed project will focus on the development of numerical tools for the computation of sloshing flow and its coupling with motions of LNG ships. The research is summarized as follows: (1) A conservative form of the constrained interpolation profile (CIP) method will be developed for the computation of 3D sloshing flow; (2) A fully nonlinear time-domain method will be developed to compute ship motions in extreme seas. The ship motions will be coupled with sloshing; (3) Validation studies will be carried out for the coupled motion. 



Through the proposed research, highly qualified personnel in the area of marine hydrodynamics with strong computational skill will be trained. The proposed research will contribute nationally and internationally to the field of ship and offshore hydrodynamics, especially numerical studies of nonlinear ship motions and highly nonlinear free surface flow.

"Very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFAs) such as arachidonic acid (20:4n 6, ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n 3, DHA) are essential components of mammalian cell membranes and precursors of biologically active compounds, such as mammalian eicosanoids and docosanoids. Dietary VLCPUFAs not only provide protection against common chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome and inflammatory disorders, but can also enhance the performance of the eyes, brain and nervous system. The current sources for VLCPUFA supplements are oils from fish and microbes. However, shrinking fish populations and possible contaminants in fish oil, along with the low yields and high costs of oil extraction from microbial sources are making the economic sustainability of these traditional sources questionable. In the past few years, research workers have explored the use of transgenic plants as an alternative source for VLCPUFAs. Genes encoding desaturases and elongases involved in the biosynthesis of VLCPUFAs have been identified from microalgae and fungi, and successfully introduced into plants. However, transgenic plants expressing these genes produced VLCPUFAs at a level much lower than that found in native microorganisms, implying additional factors besides desaturases and elongases per se are required for the synthesis and accumulation of higher levels of VLCPUFAs in heterologous systems. The goal of this research is to identify and characterize these factors in the native Thraustochytrium sp, a single cellular protist capable of accumulating substantial amounts of VLCPUFAs in triacylglycerols. Specifically, we will identify and characterize acyltransferases, which facilitate polyunsaturated acyl flux, and cofactors of the condensing enzyme/elongase, which assist in the elongation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Achieving these goals will significantly contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the synthesis, assembly and accumulation of VLCPUFAs, and will provide strategies for the transgenic production of VLCPUFAs in oilseed crops.","Agriculture and primary food production","University of Saskatchewan",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Lipides,Biochimie
"Increasing traffic congestion on freeway networks around the world call for innovative traffic control strategies and systems that can maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of the existing transportation infrastructure. Reduced traffic congestion leads to reduced car idling which leads to less carbon dioxide emissions. The Transportation Research Program at the University of Alberta has submitted an NSERC Discovery Grant application which proposes the development of an adaptive and coordinated traffic-control strategy to improve freeway mobility. The research group will collect some field data, model and simulate the possible implementation of control strategies, and analyze its principal impact on freeway-traffic-flow efficiency.

Traffic-related research, however, is an application-oriented research field. The lack of practical data is one of the key difficulties researchers are facing now, and it is necessary to collect field data to generate efficient and excellent research. Traffic demand, flow and travel time are three critical parameters in the traffic research field. This data must be collected with sufficient temporal and spatial coverage to validate the potential algorithms and strategies for freeway operations derived from the ongoing and future research studies. The requested equipments in this proposal include: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) System for collecting traffic demand data, Radar Traffic Detector (RTD) System for collecting traffic flow data, and Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) Handset with a GPS Unit for collecting travel time data.

The proposed traffic data collection tools can be used for other research projects as well as to introduce and train undergraduate and graduate students in the use of common field equipment in classes and term projects. Each year around 150 undergraduate students and 30 graduate students can understand the principle and know how to use them through class teaching and field work, and that will be a great experience for their professional career.

"Apoptosis is a form of cell death that plays an important role in controlling tissue development and homeostasis; however, dysfunction occurs in numerous diseases. Mitochondria are important mediators of cell survival and death given their role in producing energy, altering the levels of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS), and releasing factors that directly promote apoptosis. Recent evidence suggests that increased apoptosis in skeletal muscle contributes to the muscle atrophy and possibly the functional deficiencies associated with neuromuscular disorders, cardiovascular disease, and aging. Skeletal muscle has the remarkable ability to undergo various cellular adaptations including alterations in mitochondrial biogenesis/content in response to physiological and pathophysiological stimuli. Independent studies have shown that reduced mitochondrial content along will increased oxidative stress and apoptosis occurs in several skeletal muscle disorders and aging. In contrast, physical activity can increase mitochondrial biogenesis, improve ROS removal, and decrease apoptosis in skeletal muscle. Collectively, these studies suggest that mitochondrial content may be an important factor dictating cell function and survival. However, the direct effect of altered mitochondrial content on oxidative stress and apoptosis has not been studied in any cell type including skeletal muscle. The proposed research will alter mitochondrial content in vitro (in muscle and non-muscle cells) and in vivo (skeletal muscle) using several different approaches. Using state-of-the-art methods, we will comprehensively examine how apoptosis and oxidative stress (at a basal state and in response to cellular stress) are altered in conditions of low or high mitochondrial content. Further, the efficacy of regular physical activity (which induces mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle) will be evaluated as a strategy to inhibit skeletal muscle oxidative stress, apoptosis, and atrophy in response to chemical stress and a pathophysiological condition of muscle atrophy. Ultimately, the findings of this research could have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate skeletal muscle apoptosis and physiological adaptations that occur with exercise.","Medical and health sciences","University of Waterloo",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Sciences de la vie li�es � la sant� publique et aux maladies humaines","Sciences de la vie li�es � la sant� publique et aux maladies humaines"
"Power electronic systems are widely used in alternative energy systems such as fuel cells to transform, control and supply the energy from the fuel cell to the load (stand-alone systems) or the utility grid (grid-connected systems). A fuel cell (FC) is an energy conversion device that produces electricity by electrochemically combining fuel (e.g. natural gas, hydrogen, methanol, etc.) and oxidant (oxygen from air). Fuel cells are similar to batteries in that both produce dc voltage and current. Hence, power conditioning units consisting of dc-dc power converters and dc-ac inverters are required as interfaces to the load or the standard utility grid. Power electronics designers of the power converters for fuel cell applications face the challenge of ensuring high reliability, high efficiency, low cost, and safety of operation. These desirable features can be achieved through the development of suitable power converter topologies and control strategies. The successful development of the power converters is hindered by the high cost and complexity of peripheral devices of fuel cell stack. A fuel cell simulator that can emulate a fuel cell stack without using an actual fuel cell stack will reduce developmental costs and enable the advancement of the power conditioning systems.

The goal of the proposed research program is to develop a robust and versatile fuel cell generation system based on the Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC). In the short term, it is proposed to investigate, develop and implement control strategies for the power electronic converters that will enable the fuel cell simulator to emulate the electrical characteristics of the fuel cell stack for stand-alone applications.

The proposed research addresses the need for an easier and cheaper approach to enhance the development of fuel cell generation systems. Strategically, the research program seeks to develop an experimental test-bed that will be used to provide integrated solutions to meet the demand for smart, clean and efficient sustainable energy resources. The research program will also provide training for senior undergraduate and graduate students in the area of alternative energy systems.

"The researcher will investigate the behaviour of large interacting stochastic systems.  For example, partial differential equations are used as models throughout the sciences, but are often an approximation of discrete many body systems.  One would like to know how the discreteness and randomness, which are really present, will affect the systems on a large scale.  To do this one has to develop methods for the analysis of such systems with effectively infinitely many degrees of freedom.

"A thorough understanding of many financial and climatic phenomena requires the simultaneous observation of many random variables. Recently, the theory of copulas has revolutionized the classical approach of multidimensional modelling by perfectly defining the nature of the dependence between random variables without relying on the individual stochastic behaviours. However, a satisfactory and rigorous application of copulas requires the use of statistical methods that are strongly justified, which remains to be developed in many contexts of applications. 



The main aim of this proposal is to elaborate new statistical methodologies in order to verify hypotheses that can be stated in terms of copulas. A special attention will be given to so-called ""composite"" hypotheses. In order for the procedures to be completely rigorous, modern methods of re-sampling will be adapted for each treated situations and will be formally justified. Many important aspects will be visited, in particular tests of independence between random vectors, tests for the detection of break-points in dependence structures, nonparametric symmetry tests and goodness-of-fit procedures. 



The possibility to verify formally these hypotheses will enable a better understanding of many natural and financial phenomena, where these questions are of a great interest. Also, in addition to the development of new statistical procedures for specific problems, this project will allow a better use of empirical processes based on ranks. In particular, the proofs of the validity of the re-sampling techniques that will be defined, like the bootstrap and the multiplier method, will allow to consider many other interesting hypotheses in the future.

"We study and develop optimization models and methods for decision problems in Operations and Supply Chain Management, along four main research directions.  

(1) Scheduling methods and applications: In addition to theoretical work on the structure of scheduling polyhedra and approximation algorithms, we work on several applications of scheduling: production planning and scheduling in underground mines; scheduling of medical procedures in health care systems; and staff scheduling in resort operations. 

(2) On-line algorithms and robust approaches to Operations and Revenue Management: We apply a competitive online approach to decision problems for dynamic pricing, for example, of airline seats, hotel rooms or Video On Demand services, as well as recallable products in Revenue Management; and randomized on-line scheduling algorithms.

(3) Lattices and parametric discrete optimization: In this more fundamental research, we study the structure of algebraic lattices and of lattice programming problems; structural and algorithmic properties of parametric minimum cuts in networks; and algebraic methods in parametric integer programming and related problems. 

(4) Discrete Optimization methods for strategic Supply Chain management: We investigate computational properties of discrete versions of principal agent and monopoly pricing problems, and the role of logistic system design decisions in electronic business.   

This research program addresses fundamental issues in and applications of Discrete Optimization, and is expected to contribute both to fundamental knowledge and to several sectors of the Canadian economy.

"Canadian boreal forests occupy 77% of this country's forested land and account for over one third of the Earth's total boreal forest resource. These forests represent a huge reservoir of carbon on a global basis, containing close to 25% of the total carbon present in all the Earth's vegetation and soils. Eighty four percent of boreal forest carbon stocks are in soil, with only 16% in vegetation. In view of their importance in the global carbon budget, there is an urgent need to better understand the processes responsible for carbon accumulation and sequestration in boreal ecosystems. But there is a paucity of studies on carbon biogeochemistry in boreal forest soils, and very little is known about the exact nature and stabilization mechanisms of their organic matter, and resulting soil carbon stocks. 



Microorganisms mediate organic matter formation in soils. They break down plant residues, transforming some of these residues into more resistant compounds. The resulting organic matter is a heterogeneous mixture. It encompasses labile and stabilized carbon pools whose relative distribution may vary greatly among soils as a function of environmental conditions. This research program will quantify the influence of vegetation and climate on the composition and distribution of carbon pools in a wide range of Canadian boreal forests. Secondly, novel analytical techniques will trace the fate of individual litter molecules to clarify their specific degradation and stabilization pathways within the soil environment.

The past decade has seen a renewed interest on marine biodiversity due mainly to growing concerns over habitat deterioration, and loss of species and key ecosystem services. Nonetheless, conservation and management priorities continue to focus on charismatic or economically valuable species, disregarding the study of critical habitats and their influence on the interactions that shape marine biodiversity. A prime example of this is the poor understanding we have of the processes organizing communities associated to marine sediments, the single habitat encompassing a vast majority of the world's seafloor. For example, in sandy and muddy shores the presence of scattered beds of oysters and mussels adds substantial complexity to these otherwise uniform coastal habitats. It is well known that these patchy beds enhance the number and diversity of coastal species, but it is still unclear what role they play in the trophic interactions taking place within and among this landscape of patches. This program combines elements of landscape ecology and predator optimal foraging to address three intriguing but blurry phenomena: the influence of biogenic patches (oyster and mussel beds) upon landscape biodiversity, their mediation of among-predator interactions, and their effects on predator-prey interactions. This program takes advantage of the ongoing spread of an invasive predator, the green crab (Carcinus maenas), and the striking preference that this species and its native counterpart exhibit for patches of biogenic habitat. Due to the nature of the questions outlined here, this mosaic of biogenic patches embedded into a sedimentary matrix represents a unique model system in which to study species interactions with broad ecological applicability. Ultimately, improved understanding of the processes associated to local phenomena like habitat patchiness, and large scale phenomena like invasion biology, will lead to a more comprehensive understanding and a better management of marine biodiversity.","Oceans, seas and estuaries","University of Prince Edward Island",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Oc�anographie biologique","Oc�anographie"

"We propose to develop a miniaturised sensor with mass less than 400 g that is able to determine spacecraft orientation, motion and orbit location for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) applications. The sensor will acquire and maintain a four-dimensional attitude quaternion and time derivative using inertial gyro and rate sensors and camera images of the surrounding space to determine uniquely orientation. It will also utilise timing signals broadcast by global positioning spacecraft including the GPS network in order to derive a geospatial location and velocity with respect to Earth. The sensor will estimate high-precision expected mean values of these parameters as they evolve in time using a fourteen-dimensional stochastic state estimator that predicts the spacecraft attitude and broadcasts this information via serial data stream to the spacecraft bus. We propose further to utilise an Earth-motion model in our attitude estimator to provide the first mechatronic device to provide attitude-coordinate predictions with respect to either solar system or Earth-based reference frames as well as predict solar, Lunar and Earth location.  Our star-camera research will also examine additional information that may be extracted from motion blur in camera images.



We will design, build and qualify for space flight a prototype sensor in our space-test facility and seek opportunities to contribute sensors to flight opportunities in support of the utilisation of space. Micro-satellites offer access to Earth orbit at a fraction of the cost of traditional space vehicles. Micro-satellites are developed quickly and efficiently by small teams of students and professionals and may be launched inexpensively in multiple batches riding as secondary launch payloads.

"In recent years, the field of tissue engineering (production of artificial living tissues) has grown rapidly, but many technical barriers remain before it can be used routinely in hospitals.  A major problem for tissue engineers is that in order to make large pieces of tissue from small biopsies (for example, to replace a ""hole"" in someone's cartilage), they need to extract cells from the biopsy, multiply the cells, and then allow the cells to produce a new, relatively large piece tissue.  Standard methods for multiplying cells are not very well adapted for this purpose.  This is because most types of cells of interest for tissue engineering can only be multiplied by growing them on a flat surface.  When they fill up the available space, they need to be removed and placed on a new surface to continue multiplying.  This removal process is damaging to cells, and requires a lot of manpower. We recently designed and built a device for culturing cells on highly stretchable surfaces.  This device provides a cell culture surface which can be increased by 10 times.  Therefore, more space can be provided to cells as they grow, without the need to remove them from the surface.  This is expected to have important advantages, including the production of higher quality cells for improved tissue engineering.  However, much work must still be done to improve the interactions between cells and this highly deformable surface.  This proposal aims to explore several options for optimizing the ways that cells attach and grow on these surfaces, in order to produce the best possible cells for tissue engineering.  The main approaches will involve chemical modifications to the stretchable surface.  Results from this work will therefore contribute to the development of an exciting new technology that may revolutionize the way that people culture cells for many different biological and medical applications.

"Unprecedented warming and human disturbance in the zone of discontinuous permafrost has led to substantial permafrost melt in recent years. This has the potential to greatly alter the nature of water cycling within, and the volume and timing of runoff from the wetland-dominated drainage basins that characterise much of the discontinuous permafrost zone in the Northwest Territories (NWT) and elsewhere. The uncertainty regarding the mechanisms and rates of permafrost melt, the impact of this melt on water drainage and storage patterns and processes, and appropriate mitigation strategies, underscores the need for sound scientific research to provide the knowledge base required for informed and sustainable management of this resource. In response to this need, this research project will develop a suite of models for predicting the response of discontinuous permafrost to climate warming and human disturbance from oil and gas exploration and the consequent change in landcover and river flow regime in the NWT. This will be achieved by meeting the following short-term objectives: 1) map the spatial distribution of permafrost and its change over the past 50 years using aerial photography and satellite images, 2) develop new conceptual and mathematical models of hydrological processes, 3) develop a new permafrost model including the effects of human-induced disturbances, and 4) couple the hydrological model with the permafrost model to predict the spatial distribution of permafrost and the river flow regime under possible scenarios of climate change and human-induced disturbances. Annual User Community Workshops in Yellowknife will focus on interactive training of the new science-based predictive tools needed to properly manage northern water resources in the wetland-dominated regions with melting, discontinuous permafrost. The project will also partner with federal and territorial agencies, NGOs, industry and local stake-holders for the purpose of developing the NWT Water Strategy, the NWT Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, and other key federal-territorial joint initiatives concerning permafrost melt and water resources.",Water,"Wilfrid Laurier University",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Hydrologie,Hydrologie

"My long-term research goals are: i) to understand the processes influencing the abundance and distribution of tree- and crop-eating insects, especially the role of the plant that they feed on; and ii) to use this information in pest management programs that diminish our need for pesticides.   Although the host plant is generally considered to play a major role in the population dynamics of insects feeding on hardwoods, most previous studies with galling and defoliating insects on conifers have emphasized the role of natural enemies (i.e., parasites, predators and disease). I will carry out field surveys and manipulative field experiments to determine the independent and interacting effects of plant characteristics and natural enemies on the abundance and performance of insect feeding on small white and black spruce trees, large hemlock trees and on birch trees. The underlying hypothesis of my research is that variations in these factors within individual plants is as great as that between plants, and thus that variations within plants can have as great an effect on insects as variations among plants.  Results from these studies will advance our understanding of interactions between insects and plants but will also provide information needed to provide environmentally friendly management tools for common forest pests.

"Camera networks are an emerging enabling technology for a broad range of applications, including video surveillance, environment and traffic monitoring, elderly care, intelligent environments, and urban and participatory sensing. Most researchers who are motivated by the challenging open problems in camera network research, however, simply do not have the resources to work with a large-scale physical camera network, given the cost and other serious impediments of deploying and experimenting with a camera network of appropriate complexity in an extended public space. A compelling alternative is ``Virtual Vision'', a novel camera network research paradigm that prescribes using visually and behaviorally realistic virtual environments for developing and evaluating camera networks. Virtual vision enables researchers to deploy virtual camera networks in visually and behaviorally realistic 3D computer simulated environments and to experiment with these networks under realistic conditions.



In prior work, I have implemented a prototype virtual vision simulator and exploited it to develop two novel camera networks that are capable of carrying out observation and sensing tasks with minimal human intervention. I now propose to start a new research program at the UOIT, whose objective will be to take this promising initial work to the next level. The proposed research program will have the following four objectives: 1) to implement richer 3D simulations for virtual vision by developing new, more powerful behavioral and cognitive virtual human models, 2) to develop scalable 3D simulations of this kind on high performance computing systems, 3) to develop next-generation ad hoc networks of smart cameras by tackling fundamental problems in multi-camera control and coordination, and 4) to validate the virtual vision paradigm by using a real, physical multi-camera system.","Information, computer and communication technologies","University of Ontario Institute of Technology",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Vision artificielle",Robotique
"Knowledge Discovery and Data mining is the nontrivial process of extracting implicit, novel, and useful information from large volume of data. It has emerged as a unique combination of several fields of science and technology including statistics, data management, computer programming, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. 

Stream data mining represents an important class of data-intensive applications where packets of information flow dynamically in large volumes, often demanding fast and real-time processing of the most current information. Applications of stream data mining include web data flow analysis, stock market analysis, and network security. 

Many of the currently established data mining algorithms perform well on static data yet fall short of addressing the challenges of analyzing data streams including high volumes of data, and temporal characteristics of streaming data. Unlike data processing methods for stored datasets, solutions for analyzing streaming data require fast and memory efficient techniques.

The focus of this research is to explore novel methodologies for mining streams of data.  The research is aimed at discovering and understanding the various challenges in stream data mining, and to perform a systematic investigation of the principles, algorithms, and applications of stream data mining techniques. Additionally, since data mining techniques facilitate discovery of hidden patterns which might be confidential and legally protected, we will consider privacy preserving issues in mining streams of data, and develop a framework to compare various privacy preserving techniques. 

The results of the research will be used to develop efficient and scalable methods for mining streams of data, and subsequently applying them to specific applications in telecommunications industry.

"Systems biologists use networks to model chains of protein interactions and activations that relay information within a cell.  Communication over these signaling networks enables living organisms to adapt and survive in diverse and adverse conditions.  For example, if a cell encounters an acidic environment, a signaling pathway is triggered, relaying information from the cell wall to the nucleus so that the cell can produce molecules for repair and restructuring.  The importance of signaling networks is underscored by the numerous human diseases -- including cancer, autoimmunity, and diabetes -- related to malfunctions in cell signaling.  Unfortunately, our current knowledge of signaling networks is largely incomplete.  



This proposal aims to develop and analyze novel methods for inferring signaling networks based on a communication-theoretic, systems approach which we refer to as ""genomic network tomography"".  High-throughput experimental techniques provide data that reflect which cell components are involved in a signaling pathway but do not directly reveal network structure, making network inference extremely challenging.  The initial research undertaken in this project will be founded upon my prior work on network tomography, the problem of mapping Internet connectivity from similar incomplete measurements.  Mathematically, network tomography bears a strong resemblance to the problem of inferring signaling network structure.  The longer term objective of this project is to close the loop between experimentation and network analysis by suggesting maximally informative future experiments, and incorporating new data as it becomes available.

"Research in guidance and control design under constrained digital implementation is partly motivated by two trends in unmanned systems: one in miniaturization, and the other in networked control systems.  Miniaturized platforms include micro UAVs, micro satellites, nanorobots, and precision-guided munitions. To realize such systems, however, traditional paradigms employed for the design of large aerial vehicles may no longer be applicable under the constraints of mass, size and power faced by small-scale vehicles. Such fact calls for an efficient use of computing, sensing, network and actuation technologies at the controller synthesis and implementation phases. Efficient use of available resources is especially important in case of stringent demands in vehicle performance. This project aims at developing the tools and techniques needed for an effective use of limited resources, and to comprehend the impact of adverse implementation effects on the performance of aerial vehicles. 



The approach proposed is one of incorporating implementation effects in the control synthesis phase. Formulating and solving a problem of integrated guidance and control under constrained digital implementation is expected to lead to trusted rules of thumb with regards to trade-offs, and fundamental limitations in closed-loop stability and performance. Such research is needed prior to the deployment of networked small-scale aerial platforms in safety-critical missions, where humans may be at risk.

"With increased requirements on usable systems that were traditionally created on electronics circuit substrates, the demands on the computer-aided design tools have increased. Not only will future systems need to include disparate incoming technologies, with significantly higher aggregate complexity, but the demands for the manufacturability, handling design complexity, and resolving fundamental energy limitations will increase. The objective of this project is to advance and unify the techniques for designing, testing and verification of integrated microsystems. First, we will explore the  synthesis and test of reversible logic that address the energy dissipation bottleneck in a fundamentally better way.  We will further extend the use of the word-level circuit representations, and the means to facilitate expandable and scalable specifications, verification, test and optimization capabilities. We will develop practical tools capable of composing the specifications, while dealing with higher levels of abstractions and reasoning about, and optimizing, the precision of the implementation, all within the same framework. In particular, as a continuation of the recent work, we plan to extend the use of word-level representations to the microsystems that will employ incoming nanotechnology substrates, including the coherent quantum computing and reversible systems. Based on our original quantum circuit modeling platform, and the inherent properties of quantum computing systems, where word-level quantities naturally get employed in quantum bits (qubits), the extension of the word-level representations will be developed as well. Finally, the design case studies of practical distributed microsystems, such as wireless sensor networks will be used to derive reliability, testability and security solutions tailored for low-power and low-overhead implementations.

"Computing, communication, and networking have gone through a phenomenal evolution in recent years. Mobile or cell phones embedded with computing power are finding their in roads even in rural population in developing nations. As a result there has been an increased interest in ""HCC or Human Centered Computing"". HCC is not a new field but a new focus in the analysis, design, development, and deployment of application oriented software systems. Human computer interface (HCI) and user centered design (UCD) focus more at the interface level whereas the scope of HCC is expanded to the software life cycle level with due emphasis to human aspects and it is relatively more interdisciplinary in nature. In the use of computing as a tool, humans work on their own interacting with a computer system or interacting with other humans assisted by the computing infrastructure. As computing becomes ubiquitous, researchers in technology have a social obligation not to ignore the efforts required to bridge the ""digital divide"" that the computing technology is introducing. Content creation, dynamics of the content, trust on the information, local relevance and sustainability, all these in the context of social development are non-trivial issues. The proposed research in this grant application is a small  attempt towards a larger goal of addressing the above issues. We focus on three sample problems that are well defined in scope for an individual researcher. The problems are selected to match, social relevance, feasibility of the experimental approach proposed and the availability of test grounds. The problems addressed are to seek answers to: How to incorporate socio-technical models in software requirements elicitation and engineering? What is the best way to support interacting clinical researchers in their quest to use multiple sources of data in formulating their hypotheses that might lead to discovery? How to empower chronically ill patients by providing right information at the right time in a right manner? Creating appropriate models, integration of models, developing model based design and prototyping, experimental evaluation with real end users are the common themes to these three selected sub problems in the proposed research.

"Tissue engineering may offer alternative treatment options for organ replacement but challenges related to the functional vascularization, rapid connection to the host vasculature and survival of cells in complex thick tissues remain. We propose here a strategy based on photolithography and site specific differentiation of bipotent angiogenic progenitor cells (APC) to engineering a prototype 3D vascular network consisting of 2 branching vessels. We will use APCs derived from mouse embryonic stem cells for method development, followed by the use ofAPCs derived from human peripheral blood. In our preliminary studies, we covalently immobilized vascular endothelial growth factor (VEOF) or platelet derived growth factor (POOF) on collagen IV. APCs preferentially differentiated into endothelial cells (ECs) with immobilized VEOF; vascular smooth

muscle cells (VSMC) were preferentially obtained with immobilized POOF. In Aiml we will further optimize this differentiation in 20 micropatterned culture, by increasing the amounts of immobilized growth factors and applying shear flow (for improved EC phenotype). In Aim2, we will assemble a 3D branching vessel using layer-by-layer photocrosslinking of chitosan, as investigated in preliminary studies. The spacing between the branching vessels will be varied from 400microm to 2mm. We will coat the lumen with VEOF-collagen IV, while the exterior will be coated with POOF-collagen IV. Upon seeding and cultivation of APCs in perfusion, the cells in the lumen of the branching vessels will tum into ECs, while those on its exterior surface will tum into VSMCs. In Aim 3, we will assess the hemocompatibility of this vascular network in vitro using human

and mouse blood. Our industrial partner is an emerging biomedical company, Rimon Therapeutics. This proposal will set a new paradigm for tissue engineering of vascular networks by controlling geometry and surface chemistry of hotocrosslinkable hydrogels, while starting from progenitors harvested from patient's blood in a non-invasive manner.","Biomedical engineering","University of Toronto",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","G�nie biom�dical","G�nie biom�dical"

"In mathematics, and in exact sciences, we often have to deal with transformations of objects.  If we transform an object according to one rule and then transform the result according to another rule, the final outcome usually depends on the order in which the transformations are applied to the object. In other words, if we use the symbols A and B for the two transformations, then the combined transformations AB and BA are usually quite different. If they are the same, i.e., if AB = BA, we say the two transformations commute. It is not hard to accept that life is much easier when one deals, and computes, with commuting transformations. Thus one question of interest in our studies is: what conditions guarantee that members of  a given collection of transformations mutually commute? Since this desired state of affairs seldom occurs, we have to be satisfied with ""the next best thing."" This can be interpreted in various ways, all of which are of interest to us. One such compromise, when dealing with certain collections of non-commuting transformations, is what is called ""simultaneous triangularizability,"" which retains many of the nice properties of commutativity and yields information about the structure of transformations.



Another line of our investigation that we hope will be useful in applications, is determining in what circumstances approximate conditions yield exact ones. We have shown about certain useful, computable, quantities related to transformations that if their values are ""close enough"" to each other, then they are necessarily equal. ""Close enough"" is, in some examples, surprisingly and manageably large.

"There is growing evidence that, under certain conditions, both explicit and implicit memory biases occur for emotionally arousing information. That is, participants who encode some information that is emotionally arousing along with identical amounts of emotionally neutral information will later retrieve significantly more of the emotionally arousing than neutral information through a variety of explicit and implicit memory paradigms. Research on false memories has demonstrated that information provided between encoding and retrieval can influence the accuracy of retrieval, however few studies have examined whether altering the emotional valence of encoded information prior to retrieval will influence what information is retrieved. The current application proposes to address questions of how retrieval is affected when the to-be-remembered information is neutral at encoding but made to be emotionally arousing at a later point in time. Our aim is to determine whether or not a memory bias for emotionally arousing information can be detected when the information is neutral at encoding. Additional studies will investigate this concept using a variety of other methodologies involving variations in the delays between encoding, the provision of new information, and retrieval; whereas others will vary the emotional valence to determine whether or not this effect is related only to negative emotions or to stimuli associated with any provoked emotion. This work will have important implications for our understanding of how the emotional (and/or neutral) nature of information affects its subsequent retrieval and for how processes associated with this are affected by the timing of the generation of emotional arousal associated with the stimuli. If our hypotheses are supported, this could provide a mechanism through which to selectively enhance (or reduce) memory for information already learned. Additional implications of this work involve the nature of memory associated with emotional problems that develop over time or after a delay.",Psychology,"Concordia University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Science cognitive -- principes fondamentaux",Psychologie
"Nanoscience and nanotechnology promise to impact the crucial issues of our era, such as renewable energy, improved medical diagnosis and treatment, more efficient information technology, and environmental protection. The realization of the full potential of nanotechnology rests, in part, upon the low-dimensional materials that exhibit multiple targeted and functionally relevant physical properties. This proposal is concerned with the general idea of multi-functionality in reduced dimensions, and the applications of the multifunctional nanosystems for addressing important chemical, physical and technological problems. Specifically, we are interested in synthesis, fundamental physical and chemical properties, and applications of rationally designed nanostructured materials that combine tunable optical, electrical and magnetic properties. These materials include: 1) complex nanocrystalline inorganic alloys and compounds, and 2) inorganic-organic, and inorganic-biomolecular hybrid nanostructures. 

    1) The rational design and studies of complex nanocrystalline alloys and compounds will provide important understanding of the relationship between the crystal and electronic structures of the low-dimensional multifunctional systems, and their optical, electrical and magnetic properties. Particular attention will be devoted to the mutual interactions between light, electricity, and magnetism at the nanoscale, in the context of novel technological applications. 

    2) Hybrid nanostructures can utilize a variety of properties unique to organic and biochemical molecules to introduce complex functionalities into inorganic nanostructures. This part of my proposal will study electronic couplings between the semiconductor nanostructures and carefully selected organic and biomolecular adsorbates, which is relevant for nanophotonics and energy conversion technologies.   

A variety of synthetic, structural, spectroscopic, magnetic, and transport techniques will be applied in these projects, with an emphasis on single nanostructure measurements.

"Hydrogen gas is currently proposed as an ideal clean fuel for use in internal combustion engines and fuel-cell technologies, an area of active research in Canada.  A principal concern is the required explosion safety associated with the storage and handling of the pressurized hydrogen gas, which is highly reactive, diffuses very fast and typically has to be compressed at very high pressures due to its low energy density.  Previous attempts at characterizing and modeling the explosion hazards of transient gas releases from storage tanks and distribution lines have failed to identify serious ignition potentials involving the actions of shocks during the transient releases of the pressurized fuel.  The present proposed research is concerned with the thorough evaluation, experimental testing and modeling of the explosion phenomena involved during the sudden release of combustible gases into air in confined and unconfined spaces and the potential for shock-enhanced ignition by shock compression and shock enhanced mixing of the released gases. 

The first stage of the research aims at characterizing the non-reactive temporal evolution of the hydrodynamic structure of strongly under-expanded jets under different degrees of confinement.  This will permit determination of the efficiency of the hydrodynamic processes to mix the fuel and air gases in terms of the geometry of the release and jet strengths, which will determine their ignitability.  The second stage of the research will be a detailed study of the coupling between the unsteady hydrodynamic motions arising during an accidental release and the reactive phenomena.  Idealized sub-problems will be isolated and studied experimentally and numerically, such as the ignition in a one-dimensional rapidly expanding diffusion layer and shock interactions with non-premixed flames.  The developed models will find application in quantitatively evaluating the risks associated with various accidental hydrogen explosion scenarios.  The improved understanding of hydrogen explosion phenomena may permit certain types of hydrogen explosions to be mitigated or eliminated altogether.

"The long term goal of this research activity is to contribute to the better understanding of the fundamentals driving comminution processes and apply this understanding to better design, optimise and control such processes as well as extend this understanding to related material breakage processes. In addition to size reduction of mineral bearing ore, it should be noted that comminution processes are central in the processing of a number of other materials such as pigment grinding in the paint industry, metal powder production in the automotive industry, metal hydride fabrication through mechanical alloying in grinding mills in the hydrogen hydride production sector as well as in ""in-situ resource utilization"" in space exploration activities. One ore breakage and wear mechanism that is common to all of these comminution processes is abrasion. Thus, the short term objective of this research is to develop a better understanding of ore breakage through abrasion and its relationship with abrasive wear and friction. 



This objective will be met by experimentation, modelling and validation. In terms of experimentation, material characterisation will be addressed to: (i) determine the material properties of a given ore so that it can be used to develop, compare and validate material models, (ii) determine the dynamics of a particular material characterisation test, determine how it can be modified to add another testing dimension and implement that modification, (iii) modify material characteristics and be able to measure the degree of modification. Modelling will: (i) explore the relationship between abrasive wear and ore breakage, (ii) determine how this relationship behaves as a function of process dynamics where discrete element models will be developed to describe behaviour of the processes and the material being ground. Finally, validation will address both the comparison of simulated results with observed measurements.

"Neptec Design Group is leading a team of industrial and academic partners to address an opportunity made

available through the Canadian Space Agency to design and build a lunar rover to satisfy at least some of the

diverse surface mobility requirements in NASA's evolving Vision for Space Exploration. One of the specific

areas to be addressed in the development of a lunar rover is the underlying mobility platform, and the various

components that enable that platform to move around under varying conditions of lunar surface characteristics

while carrying payloads of different shapes and mass properties.

The ""mobility"" technologies encompass mechanical engineering; including structural, thermal, and materials

assessment, selection and design, as well as and electrical engineering in the areas of traction drives, energy

storage, power control, and power distribution. Each of these technology areas will be assessed individually for

its technological maturity and to decide what steps are appropriate to advance the technology to an appropriate

state of readiness for use on a lunar rover. Research will be conducted to evaluate and compare the feasibility

of different wheel configurations, steering and suspension strategies, and traction designs. Wheel performance,

mass, reliability, and modularity are among the parameters to be evaluated.

The primary objectives of the CRD undertaking include:

1. Determine analytically the optimum wheel size, shape and construction given the expected range of rover

activities, payloads and lunar surface types.

2. Evaluate and compare a subset of wheel configurations through a combination of simulation and prototype

testing on a representative rover vehicle operating in a lunar analog environment.

3. Investigate the effects of operating one or more of the recommended mobility systems in the presence of the

fine, abrasive dust on the lunar surface, and identify strategies to mitigate dust infiltration and component wear.","Space and astronomy","McGill University","2 & 3","CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Conception et fabrication","Conception et fabrication"

"Many proteins function in pairs: two identical protein chains associate with each other to make a functional unit.  In a sense, they are like a set of identical twins that work together.  One way of investigating how proteins work is by introducing changes into them by site-directed mutagenesis, which allows a scientist to specify how the protein is changed, and then to study how those changes affect the function of the protein.  When applied to proteins with two identical chains, both chains will be altered. It would be interesting to study such proteins in which only one chain is altered, to see how this affects the functional unit. Think of the twins again, and imagine that they are both right handed (after all, they are identical!). Site directed mutagenesis would allow you to change their handedness, so they are both left handed. How would this change affect how they work?  What if you could change the handedness of just one of the twins, so that you could see how the pair works when one is left handed and the other is right-handed? This is what our laboratory does: we prepare dimer pairs that are no longer identical, and study the properties of the pair.  As close to half of all known proteins consist of such pairs, our work is of general value, even though we restrict ourselves to just a handful of proteins.

"Web-based information retrieval systems must contend with continuously increasing volume of data and limitations of human time and capacity to read and analyze more than a handful of search results. Querying and filtering based on some natural constraints (such as 'time' in our case) is an intuitive and effective approach to data management in this complex paradigm.



  The objective of this research is to investigate the interaction between ""time"" and ""user search"" on the Web and to advance the ability of a search engine to better understand time-sensitive queries with the general goal of improving the quality of the search experience for the Web users. The specific components of the research project are (1) advancing automatic extraction of time sensitive cues and signals from resources on the Web (e.g. pages, news articles, blogs), (2) supporting scalable annotation and indexing based on time-sensitive signals extracted in the earlier step, and (3) integrating the notion of time in both queries and search results. Together, the three research components provide a solid foundation for building scalable time-aware Web information retrieval systems. This work relates and builds on top of our earlier work on querying historical data, data extraction from natural language text and efficient approximate streaming algorithms.



Because of the nice mix of theory and practice and the current popularity of search engines, the proposed work is expected to have wide impact on research and education. The project provides a number of Ph.D.- and M.Sc.-level research for graduate students as well as research experience for a number of undergraduates.

"The simple act of walking requires the activation of over 200 muscles in the human body. Each muscle is controlled, and thus innervated, by dozens of motoneurons that are anatomically segregated within distinct regions(called motoneuron pools) of the spinal cord.  Walking movements are smooth because motoneurons innervating the legs are activated in a very precise manner throughout the step cycle.  In addition, different subtypes of motoneurons and muscle fibers are responsible for different aspects of locomotion.  Standing and slow movements are control by motoneurons and muscles fibers that differ anatomically and physiologically from those controlling heavy lifting and fast running.  While the neuromuscular system can be modulated by activity throughout life, most of the physiological and anatomical properties regulating movements are established by birth.  The long-term objective of my research program is to better understand how these physiological and anatomical properties are established during embryonic development and re-established after nerve injury.  The short-term aim of this grant proposal is to investigate 1) how specific type of motoneurons are formed in the developing spinal cord during embryonic development, and 2) how these motoneurons selectively grow to specific muscles in the body.  To achieve this aim, we will use embryonic stem cells that were differentiate into motoneurons.  These behavior of these stem cell derived motoneurons will be studied in culture, and in the developing chick embryo, in order to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating their growth and differentiation.","Not available","Dalhousie University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Morphologie animale","Biologie animale"

"My work deals with problems that are abstractions of tasks that need to be carried out in the real world -- for example, finding a conflict-free schedule for student exams, or locating drop boxes to minimize the amount of walking that letter carriers must do. Many such problems appear to be inherently hard, in that small instances can be solved by exhaustively trying all possibilities, but there are no good methods known for large instances. We have mathematical evidence that there may be no good methods for these problems, but they still need to be solved in practice. 



One hope is that these problems may have natural parameters which are small for many instances (perhaps the number of exam rooms, or the number of boxes the post office is willing to install) and for small parameters we can find good methods of solution. Such methods are known as fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms. 



I try to find FPT algorithms for problems. Some of these problems are defined on basic mathematical structures that are useful in many different contexts. Other work arises from particular areas of application, for example, the visual layout of information such as an organizational chart, or inferring an evolutionary tree from similarity information about present-day species. For some of these problems, I look for FPT algorithms, and for others, I look for mathematical evidence that even for small parameters there are no good solutions. 



This work should be considered basic research which not only has the potential for practical application but, in its emphasis on provable correctness and analyzable efficiency, is excellent training for students.

"Today, the primary concern of a consumer is the quality and safety of the food he/she consumes. As Canadians,

we enjoy one of the safest food supply in the world because of our high quality standards, efficient monitoring

and regulations. In-shell eggs and egg products are among the most commonly consumed animal food

products. As Canadians, we consume around 15.6 dozen of eggs per capita per year. Egg infected with

Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE) is a leading cause of food borne Salmonellosis. Recent outbreak of

avian influenza has raised the concern of the risk of spread in humans through consumption of sick birds and

eggs. Pasteurization is a heat treatment that is effective to inactivate food born pathogens such as SE and the

avian flu virus. The current technology consists of immersing the eggs in a hot water bath. It takes hours to

complete the process and some level of thermal degradation of proteins cannot be avoided. Alternatively,

microwave can be used to raise the temperature of in-shell eggs to the required pasteurization temperature in

minutes. The complexity of the interaction between microwave and food materials makes it difficult to predict

heating patterns. This is why we have chosen to combine an experimental and modeling approach. The study

will consist of the optimization of the microwave energy distribution inside the in-shell eggs; the microbial

validation of the process; the assessment of the effects of microwave processing on the keeping quality and

functionality of the albumen and yolk. Microwave pasteurization of in-shell eggs could become a significant

breakthrough for the poultry industry. Successful commercial applications will yield new and safer products

since pasteurized in-shell eggs are not currently sold in Canada. Infants, pregnant women, sick or

immuno-suppressed individuals and the elders stand to benefit the most from the introduction of this new line

of products. The poultry industry is very enthousiastic in adapting this new technology as they have indicated in

"Electro-technologies such as microwave (MW) and radio-frequency (RF) heating systems have the potential for widespread applications in processes that require heat such as in the drying and thermal treatment of produce. These technologies are faster and more energy efficient than conventional methods. Their use will therefore shorten exposure time to heat and can give end-products with better quality. Dielectric heating systems are powered by electricity and do not directly contribute to the production of greenhouse gases. The long-term goal of the proposed research program is to develop new applications and to promote the use of MW and RF heating in the post-production processing of produce for food and for biofuel production. However, until now, the complexity of the design process and the lack of adequate control systems have limited industrial utilization of dielectric heating systems. To achieve the long-term goal, these issues must be addressed.  

     This will be accomplished by pursuing research studies in seemingly disparate areas. An innovative approach developed in my laboratory was to combine dielectric heating with conventional heating systems to create hybrid systems. These hybrid systems have a better overall energy efficiency and performance. We will continue our studies on these hybrid systems. The control of these processes is essential for optimal performance and we will work on developing a control system that can provide real-time control over the process. We will continue to work on developing a mathematical model of the MW-assisted process, which takes into account volumetric energy generation, heat and mass transfer, stress-strain effects on the structure of the produce, and the thermal and dielectric properties of the produce. The thermal and dielectric properties of the material define the ability of the material to conduct heat and to convert MW and RF energy into heat. Validation trials will be performed to test and fine-tune the model. Such a model will help develop control strategies and methodologies. We have also started to look at possible configurations of a continuous MW system. The combined results of these various streams of research will allow us to achieve our long-term goal.

"The energy needs of society are putting an immense stress on our ecosystems, almost to the breaking point, where they may not be able to keep up with the demand. This problem is a serious one, and can only be solved by the coordinated efforts of scientists from all disciplines. One component that aims to reduce our energy demand and to produce renewable forms of energy, are the wide spread use organic light emitting diode displays (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs; 3rd generation solar cells). OLEDs offer an excellent method of creating all types of displays (from home televisions to large advertising billboards) and they consume a very small fraction of the energy compared to current technologies. OPVs are third generation solar cells that will enable us to harness the suns energy to generate electricity. The principal roadblock to the

widespread use of these devices in society at large remains their sensitivity to wet environments, both bulk water and water vapour. In this context, our strategic grant proposal directly addresses the key strategic area of Competitive Manufacturing, where the materials developed during the project will enable a wholly new solution to address these shortcomings, overcoming the issue of device failure as a result of environmental exposure. Our proposal is the first venture into using ionic liquid based materials as plausible alternatives to achieving highly effective water barriers. This is a highly original and innovative step forward, and represents a massive departure from traditional methodologies. Ultimately, success in this project will generate materials that meet or surpass the performance of current technologies, are cheaper and simpler to manufacture in large quantities and can be integrated into OLED and OPV devices in a straightforward manner.","Manufacturing processes and products","University of Western Ontario",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Polym�res et rev�tements","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"
"Current research in the field of Main Group chemistry provides substantial insight into the way molecules are held together (chemical structure and bonding).  This greatly assists in the assessment of such compounds as useable materials. Although investigations of this type are primarily an academic study, many of the results have translated into substantial economic benefit.  Main group elements are playing increasingly prominent roles in electronic materials, pharmaceuticals and new polymers.   The benefits for the construction of new main group element compounds are two fold: (a) an increased understanding of the fundamentals of structure, bonding and reactivity; and (b) this knowledge can be used to assess potential applications for value-added products.  In this context, the isolation of new compounds that contain charged main group centres, or main group centres in unconventional bonding arrangements are desirable because of their high reactivity. In this context, our group has, over the last two years, initiated a research program that centres on investigating the fundamental chemistry of a variety of main group elements, as well as developing the potential new applications of our findings.  Within this common theme, three sub areas of discovery have emerged and we are defining new directions in (a) The identification and application of unusual chalcogen compounds (Chalcogen = S, Se, Te); (b) Synthesis and applications of ionophilic materials: Ionic liquids with unusual functionalities; and, (c) The synthesis of unprecedented neutral, strained, main group element bridged cobaltoarenophane complexes.

"Obesity has become a significant health care concern globally. While a great deal of attention is being devoted to managing this condition, relatively little attention is devoted to understanding the biochemical origins of obesity. As the body begins to accumulate excess calories in the form of fat, the nature of the biochemical signals that dictate the balance between health and disease change. It is important to understand the significance of these changes. One of the major sources of these signals is fat or adipose tissue. Adipose tissue releases molecules, called adipokines, which communicate with a number of tissues throughout the body including the pancreas and heart. Some of these molecules cause inflammation and some may be responsible for causing type II diabetes. The important question that will be addressed in this research is ""what properties of adipose tissue cause it to release these molecules?"" We believe the fat senses metabolic stress from its mitochondria, the components of the cell that produce energy, and uses free radicals (produced by the mitochondria) as a means to signal the release of these adipokines. We will try to prove this by altering the level free radicals produced by fat cell mitochondria and determining the effect on the release of these signaling molecules. 

   This project will also determine why certain types of fat are better than others. For example, clinical evidence suggests that the fat around our bellies is more dangerous to our health than that underneath the skin. However, we do not understand why. My hypothesis is that free radical signals in these two depots may communicate different messages to the cellular components responsible for releasing the adipokines. We will characterize the differences in the mitochondria of these two depots by looking at their various protein components using a technology called proteomics. We will also compare the nature and levels of the adipokines released from these two depots. Taken together, this will allow us to determine the role of mitochondria in manifesting the different biochemical signals.

"One of the major causes of global warming and climate change is the production of green house gas associated with thermal power generation. Over 60% of generated electric power is consumed by motors. For many years, the applicant has been developing high efficiency interior permanent magnet (IPM) motor technology, which could help in the fight to counteract global warming. Over the previous 5-year grant period, the applicant focused on solving the basic design issues of standard line start IPM motors. This resulted in 4 PhD and 5 M.Eng graduates, 5 post-doctoral fellows, 33 Journal and 45 conference papers, 2 patents, 3 monograms. These published results have aroused considerable industrial interests and international collaborations. For his efforts, the applicant has received four major IEEE Awards, which indicates that his work is considered very significant by his peers and by industry. However, the demand of fast and precision control of speed is spearheading the development of advanced new electric motor drive systems. Thus, the objectives of the proposed research for the coming 5 years are: a) Development of interior permanent magnet (IPM) motors having high performances at super speeds, (b) Design and build high speed bearingless motor drive using intelligent controllers, c) Test innovative new technology for power inverters utilizing new wavelet modulation techniques. These objectives will be achieved in both software and hardware developments. Laboratory prototypes will be built and tested. These will be realized with the help of 4 undergraduate, 5 M.Eng and 4 PhD students and 5 post doctoral fellows in 2008-2013. The scientific approaches will involve detailed analysis and development of system models of the bearingless motors and associated power electronics including control interfaces. High performance and efficient motion control technology will dominate the specific applications market worldwide including Canada. The topics of the proposed research on advanced electric machines and power electronics system in the next 5 years are significant for economic exploitations in Canada. A five-year grant of $70,000 per year is requested to achieve the objectives of the propsed research.

"Health services administrative databases have been widely used to assess risks associated with diseases and their treatments. Although these administrative databases are excellent sources of ready-to-use information on large number of patients at minimal costs, they are prone to measurement errors. Measurement errors can be due to case or exposure misclassification and can lead to erroneous results if not addressed properly in the study design and/or statistical analyses. My research program includes three projects, each addressing one aspect of measurement error.

Project 1. Administrative databases are often used to estimate the prevalence of a disease without accounting for misclassification errors inherit in these databases. I will use a Bayesian approach to develop and assess methods of combining information available from administrative databases as well as other sources of information such as the Canadian Community Health Survey, to estimate the prevalence of a disease accounting for misclassification errors inherit in these data. This information can be combined in several ways to define either one, two or three case-definitions that may be assumed to be either conditionally independent or a correlation function may be modeled and results based on these assumptions compared. 

Project 2. In studying medication-related adverse events from administrative databases, the risk time-window defined as the period of time during which a patient could be at risk of medication-related adverse events is not exactly known. This project aims to study the effect of varying the risk time window values on the assessment of medication-related adverse events using simulated data. 

Project 3. Missing data are a major problem in medical research and can lead to biased results if not addressed properly. Multiple imputation techniques have been proposed to estimate the missing information based on observed values. This project aims to assess whether multiple imputation techniques can be used to infer the cause of death from administrative databases when only the date of death is known to the investigator.","Medical and health sciences","McGill University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Statistique et probabilit�","Statistique et probabilit�"
"Agrochemical use is of increasing concern to Canadians due to the potential impacts on the environment and human health, with currently used pesticides (CUPs) and their metabolites or degradates becoming ubiquitous in drinking water, aquatic systems, food supplies, and the air we breathe.  In the last 3-4 years CUPs have been detected in the atmosphere in agricultural regions across Canada, providing evidence of the importance of the atmospheric pathway their movement.  Our studies examine two distinctive western Canada agricultural regions:the Fraser and Okanogan Valleys in BC, dominated by berries and fruit trees, and the Prairie agricultural region, which spans AB, SK, MB and contains over 89% of area planted for grains in Canada.  These regions are at high risk for increased infestations and production pressures as a result of land-use changes and drought expected from climate change, and understanding agrochemical sources, pathways of movement, and transformations in the environment is a critical component to establishing Canadian's position for both national and international policies.



This research is interdisciplinary in nature, including the development of analytical methods utilizing advanced hyphenated chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques designed to enable the first detection of many CUPs and their potentially toxic degradation products in the Canadian atmosphere.  For those that we have recently detected, we plan to continue to build stronger linkages between existing usage information (2003 usage inventories, crop guides, practitioner information) and atmospheric concentrations to enable us to understand the differences in these two distinctive agricultural source regions.  We will examine changes in seasonal and annual trends with crop type and agricultural source region characteristics (climatic, soil type, particle concentrations in the atmosphere, potential long-range trans-boundary atmospheric sources such as from US agricultural regions).

"Collagen is the most abundant protein in animals ranging from sponges to humans. It is a major component of skin, bones, cartilage and tendons, where it forms fibres. Alternately, it forms a scaffold-like support layer called the basement membrane, crucial for formation and maintenance of other tissues. Its molecular structure and the way in which it assembles into tissue or basement membrane are not well understood.

I use two techniques to study proteins. First, with an atomic force microscope, a tiny, sharp tip is scanned over a protein surface and moved up or down in response to its topography. This provides a clear picture of the features of the protein surface, and allows us to observe events such as collagen fibre formation. This microscope can also be used to measure the amount of force required to pull apart two interacting collagen proteins, which provides valuable information about the way the two proteins are held together and the strength of their interaction. Unfortunately, it is difficult to use this microscope to identify the exact atomic composition of the protein or the interacting atoms giving rise to the forces measured. With nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, on the other hand, individual atoms within a protein can be identified and studied. This technique allows a picture of the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms within collagen to be built, assisting interpretation of the microscopic picture of the collagen surface. Regions involved in binding to a second collagen protein and causing measured interaction forces can also be identified. The information obtained by these two techniques is therefore highly complementary, but they are not routinely used together. 

My research program will use protein models of collagen shorter than the full-length natural collagen. These will be engineered and produced to be suitable for study by both of these biophysical methods. This will allow us to fill in major gaps in our knowledge of collagen and its function in animals, including humans.

"This research program examines the brain mechanisms underlying the mental representation with a particular focus on the neurobehavioral determinants of pain communication. Recent studies have suggested that the perception of pain in others relies on the activation of pain-related brain networks in the observer, providing some support to a neural-simulation theory of empathy. Functional imaging methods are used in this research program to investigate the brain mechanisms involved in the perception and interpretation of the facial expression of pain. Experiments will be conducted examine brain responses to facial expressions of pain, and the impact of the perception of pain in other on pain sensitivity in the observer. Additional studies will look at the interactions between brain networks underlying pain perception and motor-networks involved in the regulation of facial expression when pain is felt. These studies will contribute to the understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying the receptive and expressive sides of pain communication.",Psychology,"Universit� de Montr�al",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Neurologie du comportement",Psychologie

"Title: Prefrontal cortical modulation of stress response



Mind is now thought to be located mainly in a part of the brain called prefrontal cortex. We use this part of the brain to perform most of the executive brain functions including decision making and controlling our emotions.  This area is also responsible for identifying the nature, environment and type of physical and societal stressors and selecting the appropriate responses.  Unfortunately, repeated exposure to stress seriously affects this part of the brain and impairs its ability to control stress responses and to perform executive functions.  The mechanisms underlying these effects are currently unknown.  However, certain groups of neurons in this part of the brain are undergoing degenerative changes following exposure to stress, and it is believed that these degenerative changes may underlie the functional deficits.  We have found high levels of a protein in this part of the brain following repeated exposure to stress.  This protein is not normally found in this brain area.  This protein is capable of causing similar degenerative changes in other brain areas.  In this study, we are proposing to determine whether activity of this protein is indeed increased in this part of the brain following exposure to repeated stress, and whether blocking the activity of this protein would reverse repeated stress-induced degenerative changes and restore the normal functions of this brain area.  Expected results from this study will help to identify how repeated stress could affect executive brain functions in normal individuals and point to potential drug targets to prevent such effects.","Advancement of knowledge","University of Western Ontario",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Neurologie du comportement",Psychologie

"This research proposal is a collaborative research effort between the University of Manitoba and the Manitoba HVDC Research Centre to investigate new methods and technologies for transmission line fault location (LFL) in HVDC systems. The project also intends to use the same monitoring framework to investigate the detection of abnormal operating conditions.

When a permanent fault occurs in a HVDC transmission line, it is required to quickly locate the fault as accurately as possible. This is essential for carrying out necessary repairs in a timely fashion and minimizing possible power outages. The flashover at the fault point launches two waves that travel in opposite directions away from the fault. The existing LFL technology is based on capturing and analyzing the transients appearing at either end of the line. This travelling wave based LFL technology has served very well for the DC transmission systems using overhead (O/H) transmission line.

The number of cable, and combination cable and O/H HVDC systems is steadily growing. Further, the multiple terminal voltage source converter (VSC) HVDC systems are under consideration in many places, especially in the context of offshore wind farms and other renewable energy development projects. The existing LFL detects the arrival of waves by sensing the current spikes that pass through the surge capacitors located at the line terminals. This technique doesn't work well with cables due to high cable capacitance. The large DC capacitors on the VSC-HVDC schemes also have an effect similar to that of the cable capacitance. The existing fault location is strictly for two terminal systems. New signal processing techniques such as wavelet transformation

and intelligent systems have a clear potential to offer technical solutions that will improve the detection and location of line faults in non-traditional HVDC configurations. This research intends to explore this possibility and develop effective fault location algorithms, and implement them in a prototype LFL.","Electrical energy","University of Manitoba",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","R�seaux �lectriques","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"
"Driven by the environmental and economic considerations, Distributed Energy Resources (DER), which includes Distributed Generation (DG) and Energy Storage (ES), connected to low and medium voltage distribution systems is rapidly increasing. Large-scale integration of small renewable energy and co-generation system could yield significant emission reductions. Introduction of DER has significantly changed the power distribution system from its early passive state to an active network. However, current practice is to disconnect the distributed generation at the loss of the main supply. With high penetration levels of DG, frequent switching-off of DGs may lead to economical, social and technical problems. The concept of microgrids can be a valuable option to address many of the above issues.

A microgrid is an integrated energy system having interconnected loads and distributed energy resources, which can operate in parallel with the grid or in an intentional island mode. In this vision, it will be possible to operate the distribution system with DGs as a self controlled reliable system. However, reliable operation of a microgrid requires in-depth studies in planning, control and protection: how an islanded parts of distribution system having distributed generation and energy storage be operated stably and resynchronized? How could a microgrid be adequately protected under different modes of operation and during transitions? This proposal addresses this important problem where there is a gap in knowledge, and proposes a comprehensive research program to identify proper protection, control and design approaches for microgrids.

The proposed research program will be a natural continuation of the previous research carried out the University of Manitoba under the theme of Control and Protection of Networks with Distributed Generation. It is expected that outcomes of the above studies will lead to the development of suitable protection and control schemes for an active distribution system thus enabling wide spread integration of cleaner energy resources to electricity distribution networks.

"The use of exotic germplasm to improve the productivity of crop plants has been limited due to relatively low and variable success that has been encountered, depending on the species and germplasm used. In soybean, after the initial introduction of ancestral lines in the last century, there has been little use of breeding materials exchanged between the Chinese (centre of origin and diversity) and North American soybean breeding programs, even for materials coming from similar growing regions. Typically, the lack of environmental adaptation in non-host environments has hampered progress in using exotic germplasm resulting in a rare recovery of, or surpassing, of the adapted parent's yield in the progeny. If seed yield is the ultimate measure of a given crop's adaptation potential, it does not seem to be explained solely by the maturity group or the latitude the introduced materials came from. Within the previous NSERC Discovery grant, we have determined that a ratio of universal vs. continent-specific quantitative trait loci (QTL) appears to drive the forces of adaptation to mega-environments. In this proposal, we will attempt to address the following questions. Does the mega-environment in which the breeding population is developed influence a non-random selection of genotypes, even when breeding methods that assume randomness of selection are practiced? Is segregation distortion caused by non-random selection of genotypes, even when breeding methods assume randomness? How important a role do markers that show segregation distortion play in the expression of yield QTL? What is the role of interacting QTL (epistasis) in determining adaptation? Can a portion of the observed diversity in QTL alleles for seed and agronomic traits in the Chinese germplasm be explained in part by the greater use of the wild soybean progenitor, Glycine soja, by the Chinese soybean breeding programs? The conceptual significance of this research is that the determining of the underlying genetic principles of crop adaptation may aid in the development of a more strategic and genetically-based introgression of new genetic variation into a number of species.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","University of Guelph",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres"

"Electrical energy is generated using different prime resources such as nuclear, water, coal, oil and to a much lesser extent, wind and solar power. Equipments used for electrical energy conversion and transmission to far away consumption centers, often over several hundred miles, are designed to operate at very high voltages, often in the range of half a million Volts. Such high voltages are necessary to deliver very large blocks of power, for economical reasons. 

  Electrical insulation used in these very expensive equipments is called dielectrics. Failure of equipment is due to the failure of insulation used within, in majority of cases. Some examples of insulating materials used in the power industry are porcelain, plastic materials such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and many modern synthetic. These adverse operating conditions may be high temperatures and severe climatic conditions such as water and moisture, acids, pollution, dust, exposure to sun light and outdoor conditions. 

  Electrical insulation also plays an important role in the semi conductor industry. Computers have become the silent slaves of modern society. The computers have several hundred thousands of transistors and other electrical components. To keep them healthy, operating at peak efficiency proper insulation is required. Failure of insulation is failure of computers, robots and other automated devices.

  In attempts to improve the reliability and economics of power generation, transmission, semiconductor industry and automation, most recent advances are applications of nano-dielectrics and ultra-thin films. Nano-dielectrics are insulating materials that have the dimension of a nanometer in their basic, prefabrication stage. In comparison, traditional insulating materials are fabricated from components that are of micrometer size, a thousand times larger. The investigator has an international reputation for his expertise in this area, having recently published two authoritative volumes and contributed to this branch of science and engineering over a period of nearly five decades.

"The primary goal is to conduct systematic analytical and experimental investigations in: (i) human responses to occupational vibration exposure and to seek effective interventions through vibration control; and (ii) vehicle systems dynamics for enhancement of safety dynamics limit and vibration comfort. The motivations for the first subject stem from the fact that occupational exposure to segmental and whole-body mechanical vibration has been associated with an array of health and safety risks. For example, the occupational exposure of operators to hand-held power tools vibration has been related to various disorders in vascular, sensorineural and musculoskeletal structures of the hand-arm system, while that to whole-body vibration environment of work vehicles has been related to disorders of the spine and supporting structure, discomfort, fatigue and loss of working efficiency. The latter research focus is concerned with safety dynamic limits of partly-filled tank trucks, advanced vehicle suspension concepts and vehicle vibration control.  The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop effective methods for assessing risks to vibration exposure, effective vibration control mechanisms, and build knowledge on the role of various operating factors. The proposed research program will focus on a number of specific studies in order to achieve the goals, namely: (i) characterization and modelling of biodynamic responses of the hand-arm system to multi-axes tools vibration ; (ii) analyses of distributed biodynamic responses in terms of vibration energy transfer to various substructures for deriving frequency-weighting; (iii) biodynamic response characterization of seated human body to whole-body vibration along vertical and horizontal axes; (iv) analyses of design concepts in antislosh devices for enhancement of directional performance of partly-filled tank trucks; (vi) analyses of semi-active and advanced pasive suspension concepts. The research works are also expected to contribute to the ongoing standradization efforts towards building guidelines and methods for assessing the helath and safety risks imposed by occupational shock and vibration exposures.

"The primary focus of work in this laboratory is on how daily rhythms of behavior and physiology are generated. This includes research into the biology of the central clock in the hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, as well as how a hierarchy of clocks throughout the body are controlled either by the central clock or directly by sensory input. The proposed research therefore follows two interrelated approaches. The first is aimed at an understanding of how the central clock produces circadian rhythms. When we switch on a gene (casein kinase-1-epsilon) within this clock in a mouse, the period of the animal's behavioral rhythm shortens. We will now produce mice where the gene is switched on only in specific cells, to see how these cells are involved in rhythm generation. The second approach is aimed at understanding how animals adjust their daily rhythms by learning the time of day that significant events occur. This will be accomplished by teaching animals to expect appetitive or aversive conditions at defined times of day, then examining how and where the cellular activity responsible for the time of day memory occurs in the brain. Finally, we will ask how the central clock is able to synchronize the time learning system in the absence of significant event.  The work will contribute to our understanding of how multiple timing mechanisms in the body are coordinated. Time of day conditioning is thought to underlie the rhythms of craving seen in addiction, and internal disorganization of the many clocks throughout the body has been shown to lead to physical and mental issues such as cardiovascular disease and depressive disorders, as well as cognitive impairment.",Psychology,"University of Toronto",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Neurologie du comportement",Psychologie

"The objective is to develop miniaturized and wideband Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) structures for applications in two frequency regimes: The lower portion of the microwave regime and the THz regime. 

In the lower microwave regime, two classes of applications will be targeted: EMI filtering and switching noise suppression in high-speed packages and structures, and the design of low-profile antenna and high-gain antenna arrays. Presently there is no effective solution for the problem of switching noise and spurious propagation in high-speed boards and packages. Based on our previous work on noise mitigation in printed circuit boards, we expect the miniaturized structures proposed here to provide effective suppression in chip packages and for small circuit boards that are increasingly used for higher-density applications. In Antennas, EBG structures have proven to provide enhanced performance leading to higher gain and efficiency. However, since the drive for miniaturized and wideband antennas have been relentless, for EBGs to enhance the performance of small antennas, EBGs must be miniaturized to create sufficient homogeneity in the antenna medium. In earlier works, we have demonstrated that EBGs can decrease mutual coupling between adjacent planar antennas in antenna array applications. Miniaturized EBGs will have the potential to decrease the distance between adjacent antennas and thus achieve higher antenna density leading to higher antenna array gain per unit area. 

For miniaturization, we will use high-k materials. Wideband EBG structures will be developed based on the concept of low-dispersion planar (metallization) and non-planar (photonic crystals) non-resonating EBGs. 

Recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in the THz technology due to its unexplored potential in sensor-related technologies. In such regimes, nanotechnology in conjunction with advanced materials will be critical in achieving resonators with tunable capacitive and inductive properties.

"Curvilinear flows occur frequently in hydraulic engineering devices. The proposal is to consider a few specific flow configurations of highly curvilinear flows and determine their flow characteristics. In particular the flow related to the counter flowing wall jet will be studied in detail using experimental and numerical modeling techniques.

"Public fear of the reintroduction of smallpox as a biological weapon or agent of bioterrorism has led to a renaissance of interest in small pox. Naturally, there has been a resurgence of research on the causative organism, variola virus, and its vaccine. This includes vaccinia-virus (VV.) mechanisms such as VV-specific ligands and signaling pathways exhibited by VV. which are unknown. 



The identification of poxvirus ligands/antigens is promising for the development of subunit-based vaccines. One could envision the creation of a combination biodefense vaccine similar to the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine (MMRV). The proposed research is expected to result in identification of VV. specific immunity including TCD8+ responses to VV, identification VV-specific toll-like receptors (TLRs) ligands, signal transduction pathways as well as shed light on the role(s) played by TLRs in shaping adaptive immune responses to VV. 



TLRs are the predominant cellular receptors used in this research to identify pathogens. Collectively, fundamental knowledge gained from the proposed research will set a foundation for future research to work to improve therapeutic vaccination strategies and help in the global fight against bioterrorism.

"Land use and land cover change is a major driver of global environmental change. In particular, deforestation and agricultural expansion have had important consequences for ecosystem functioning - nearly 40% of our planet's land surface is currently used for agriculture, and nearly a quarter of the total emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is a result of tropical deforestation. A recent review concluded that land use changes have severely degraded the global environment through emissions of greenhouse gases, declines in biodiversity, alteration of freshwater quantity and quality, worsening air quality, modification of climate, and transmission of infectious diseases. On the other hand, land use practices have also provided vitally needed resources for a growing human population including food, fiber, freshwater, and shelter.



My research program addresses the Earth system consequences of land use/cover change as well as the implications for natural resources. I propose to address two questions: 1) How have historical agricultural land use changes (crop selection, irrigation, fertilization), climate change, and change in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels influenced global food production over the last century?; and 2) How has tropical deforestation influenced global carbon cycling? To address these questions, I will use satellite and ground-based observations to develop global, historical, data sets of changes in land cover (cropland and pasture expansion, deforestation) and land use (irrigation, fertilization).  I will then represent land use within computer models of global ecosystems, and use them to examine the consequences for food production and carbon cycling. 



My research program has important policy applications including improved understanding of terrestrial carbon cycling with relevance for the Kyoto protocol, and understanding the role of land management in mitigating global environmental change.

"Le cerveau est un organe particuli�rement sensible aux dommages oxydatifs. Une des hypoth�ses avanc�es pour expliquer l'�tiologie de certaines pathologies neurod�g�n�ratives, comme la maladie d'Alzheimer (MA) est que la perte des cellules neuronales serait due � une exposition chronique aux effets d�l�t�res induits par les radicaux libres (RL) et le stress oxydatif (SO). Par ailleurs, une augmentation s�lective de l'activit� du facteur de transcription nucl�aire NF-kB est observ�e dans la MA, dans les r�gions c�r�brales l�s�es o� le niveau de SO est �lev�.

"The overall theme of the applicant's program of research has been the same: use innovative concepts to improve food processing to achieve better quality, extend shelf-life, enhance safety, improve efficiency and expand marketability of food products. Innovative and novel concepts are emerging in every area of food processing such as thermal processing, microwave, radio frequency and ohmic heating, and in process characterization and modeling applications. Accurate data on rheological and thermo-physical properties of foods and food systems is required for efficient modeling of the process kinetics. Industries will constantly need to revise or adjust their manufacturing practices to the changing needs of the consumers to be able to stay competitive in the marketplace and academic institutions play a major role in highlighting the recent advances processing concepts. The proposed studies explore the these concepts for improving quality retention, minimize cost / energy consumption. The major foci of the next five year Discovery Grant will encompass: 1) Agitation thermal processing with a focus on free bi-axial rotation; 2) Novel heating techniques involving microwave studies focussed on evaluating the enhanced effects of MW on enzymes for novel applications, ohmic heating focussed on the evaluation of a high frequency ohmic heating system with stainless steel electrodes and RF heating focussed on continuous flow heating of protein based foods; 3) Food system rheology will focuss on evlauting specialty diet formulations such as those used for Dysphagic patients and beverage cloud emusions; 4)ANN modeling study will focus on osmotic drying, predictive microbiology, extrusion and post harvest technology; and 5) Evaluation of thermo-physical properties of food systems. 



Overall, it is expected that the study will provide a better understanding of the concepts involved in the application of different emerging and novel processing techniques for improving the food quality, and contributes significantly to manpower training.

"A balance between positive and negative influences govern the ability of nerve fibres (axons) to grow in the adult nervous system.  Positive factors include a class of proteins known as neurotrophins, which if artificially provided in large amounts, are known to enhance axonal regeneration in the injured central nervous system CNS.  Negative factors include proteins found in myelin, the insulation surrounding CNS axons. Blocking myelin's effects also improves axonal growth in the CNS. Both neurotrophins and myelin exert their effects on axons through complexes of receptors. Intriguingly, both complexes involve a receptor called p75, and genetically deleting p75 results in improved growth of axons in the CNS.  Importantly, p75 deletion results in growth that is superior to that when all of the myelin-derived inhibitory proteins are blocked, and even when myelin is absent altogether.  This suggests that p75 may also interfere with the growth-promoting ability of endogenously-expressed neurotrophins (those upregulated in response to injury). This proposal seeks to understand the mechanisms behind p75's role in preventing axon growth.  It will use a combination of whole-animal (rats and mice) and tissue culture experiments to test the hypothesis that in the absence of p75 function, axon growth is enhanced due to increased efficacy of neurotrophins upregulated following CNS damage. We will first examine the extent to which the absence of p75 improves behavioural function following spinal cord injury.  We will then use neurotrophin blockers to determine whether these molecules are indeed responsible for improved regeneration.  We will also determine to what extent p75 is involved in transducing the effects of myelin.  These studies will shed light on the function of a poorly-understood receptor with diverse effects.  In the long term, this project may identify therapeutic targets for clinical intervention following spinal cord injury.

"This project will develop improved technology for aerial surveillance & defence to meet modern threats (terrorism) as well as current civilian, police and fire department, needs. We address the problem of surveillance, patrol and search & rescue operations with a scalable highly manoeuvrable VTOL (Vertical and Takeoff and Landing) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) capable of safely navigating in highly obstructed urban environments. To provide adequate monitoring coverage in urban environments requires UAVs capable of placing its sensors in suitable locations impossible to reach by conventional small or big aircrafts. The aircraft to be further developed, based on previous concept prototypes, can be used as a single-man portable UAV or as a personal air vehicle. A central feature is to develop a portable UAV prototype to be tested in an

indoor/urban setting with the help of our partners, Gress Aerospace and TRLabs, which will demonstrate the high manoeuvrability and safe operation of the UAV in settings that will exemplify the scenarios encountered by the police, fire department and military. The tests will show a vehicle that responds/adapts to the environment while unaffected by potential adverse ground/wall effects or atmospheric buffeting. Departing from traditional control surfaces and thrust vectoring our UAV employs double-axis lift-fan Oblique Active Tilting mechanisms, a revolution in aviation control. Such control mechanisms act on the vehicle's double ducted fans providing advance propulsion and safe motion. Previous work by the partners of the project has shown the proposed UAV to be an order of magnitude more effective in controlling vehicle pitch, which allows

for greater vehicle manoeuvrability and ease of control when compared with traditional vehicles. The project will characterize the ground/wall effects on the UAV using computational fluid dynamic analysis and will develop control mechanisms to enable autonomous and fly by wire control. The UAV will be compared with similar size traditional vehicles. The attributes of UAVs equipped with our system (3D intra-urban mobility, independent 6-axis control and low noise signatures) provide solutions to a number of law enforcing problems.",Aerospace,"University of Calgary",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Syst�mes, homme et cybern�tique",Robotique

"This research focuses on methods to produce medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (MCL-PHAs) with controlled properties. MCL-PHAs are novel biodegradable elastomers produced by bacteria from renewable resources such as plant oils and sugars. MCL-PHAs are ideal for applications such as paper coating, biomedical implants and printing toners but they were not commercially available due to difficulties in their production. My previous Discovery Grant solved most of these problems by disproving prevailing dogma, thus allowing the development of a greatly simplified fermentation process. The present project aims at further improving this process and producing kg quantities of novel materials which can then be adequately characterized for the first time. The present research also aims to develop methods to control the rate of their degradation in water and/or the human body. My previous Discovery Grant demonstrated that these materials could be rendered bioactive by the covalent attachment of bioactive proteins to nanoparticles of MCL-PHA. The slow release of a model bioactive compound from bioactive MCL-PHA will be examined. MCL-PHAs owe their interesting elastomeric properties to crystalline cross-linking. Even tougher, more rubbery, forms of this material will be produced by covalent cross-linking and their biodegradability assessed. The overall objective of this research is to allow production of this class of water-resistant compostable thermoelastomers to become commercially feasible, thus adding another group of materials to the future ""biorefinery""-based chemical industry.

"Colored effluent into the environment is of growing concern, as color is a visible pollutant which is increasingly being regulated worldwide. It is aesthetically unpleasing, negatively impacts the environment and some synthetic dyes may be carcinogens or mutagens. Such effluents arise from textile and dyestuff manufacturing, and the pulp and paper, and food processing industries. Most current physical and/or chemical decoloration technologies do not achieve total decoloration, have operational difficulties or are too expensive; and traditional biological wastewater treatments have low removal efficiencies.  White rot fungi can decolorize a wide range of dyes. Although there are advantages to use immobilized cultures, increase in biofilm growth eventually lead to poor reactor performance. Using their enzymes will avoid this problem but soluble enzymes are not practical in treating effluents as large quantities would be needed and the enzymes could be denatured. Immobilization on a solid matrix could overcome these drawbacks. So far, we have successfully evaluated immobilized laccase but white rot fungi produce other lignin-degrading enzymes such as lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidise and cellobiose dehydrogenase that also decolorize.  To have an effective process, combinations of these enzymes are required.  The long-term objectives of this proposal are (i) to develop a cost-effective, biological process (based on immobilized enzymes) to decolorize dye effluents and (ii) to understand the degradation mechanisms. The first objective will be achieved by combining enzymes to target azo and anthraquinone dyes which make up a majority of dyes commercially used. The second objective will focus on the role of surfactants in decolorization as this effluent component causes significant enzyme inhibition. The knowledge from this work can also be applied to the degradation of other xenobiotics and biobleaching of pulp and paper.  The outcome of this project may contribute to the Canadian economy by creating jobs in the construction and operation of enzyme reactors for wastewater treatment; and improve the quality of life and the environment by removing a visible and potentially toxic pollutant.",Environment,"Queen's University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie biochimique","G�nie chimique"

"Environmental processes involve chemical reactions occurring in the air, the water, soil, and in aquatic sediments (muds at the bottoms of lakes and the oceans).  These chemical reactions determine air, water, and soil quality because they can liberate needed micro-nutrients or immobilize toxic metals or decompose harmful compounds.  Many of these most important reactions involve newly discovered ""environmental nanoparticles"" which are small aggregates of reactive substances containing only tens to thousands of atoms.  An important class of such environmental nanoparticles are nanoparticles of Fe-oxyhydroxide [Fe is the atomic symbol for iron and an oxyhydroxide is a compound with hydroxyl groups (OH) and water groups (OH2)].  Fe-oxyhydroxides play major roles in water, soils, and sediments, where they control key nutrients and metals by binding with them (when formed by precipitation) and by liberating them (when dissolved under changing conditions of pH, temperature, or oxidation power).  We are condensed matter physicists and do not normally study such environmental phenomena but we have theoretical and experimental tools that can be used to study nanoparticulate Fe-oxyhydroxides to great advantage, in order to deduce their structures, compositions, and how they were formed and in order to follow their reactions.  We do this by using advanced measurement methods (spectroscopy, diffraction, etc.), by making Fe-oxyhydroxides in the laboratory, and by developing theoretical models of how they form and react.  The more we know about Fe-oxyhydroxides, the more we can manage our impacts on soil and water and the more we can devise sustainable practices.

"In drinking water distribution systems, bacteria and other pathogens tend to cluster on pipe surfaces, otherwise known as the formation of biofilm.  Disinfection is a key step for minimizing this formation, which has the potential to lead to an increase in pathogenic microorganisms.  Suppliers will often utilize primary and secondary disinfectants in combination in the treatment process for different reasons, and although this is a widely used practice little emphasis has been placed on the potential for synergistic benefits between disinfectants.  Synergistic benefits would include an enhanced ability to reduce bacteria in distribution systems when the disinfectants ""work together"".  There have been few studies published that were designed specifically to investigate synergy, especially using UV light for the treatment of drinking water.  Previous work done by Dr. Rand has established in laboratory tests that synergy exits between UV light and chlorine-based disinfectants for removing Escherichia coli (E. coli).  It was also found in field studies through simulating distribution systems that there was potential for synergistic benefits.  To calculate synergy, a concept presented by Koivunen et al. (2005) was adopted, which stated that synergy was present when the removal of a combined disinfection strategy was greater than the sum of removals achieved by each disinfectant alone.  Although this is a useful equation, it relies on disinfectant efficacy alone.  Therefore, it is difficult to apply in long-term studies, where pipe material, water quality, nutrient supply and other issues would play a serious role in the formation of biofilm.  However, if synergy could be quantified realistically, this could lead to suppliers being able to reduce more pathogenic microorganisms without increasing disinfectant dosages.  The purpose of this research is to investigate the potential for synergy between disinfectants under different conditions and to develop a model to quantify synergy so that utilities might be able to simulate their systems without long-term bench and pilot studies.",Environment,"Acadia University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie de l'environnement","G�nie de l'environnement"
"My recent research has revealed that toxins from fungal species common on damp materials in residential housing provoke compound-specific toxic inflammatory  responses with different toxicokinetics in mouse lungs. Why different mycotoxin exposures stimulate these diverse inflammatory responses in lungs is unclear. The proposed work is a multidisciplinary mycological investigation designed to address basic, conceptual questions that concern onset of lung disease caused by exposure to fungal toxins using  in vitro cell and in vivo animal models. My short-term objective is to provide insight into the temporal and spatial patterns of inflammatory mediator expression, and to aid our understanding of lung disease onset caused by fungal toxin exposures. It is also designed to meet my long-term objective to better understand the basis for the some of changes in lung tissue and cells exposed to toxic fungal spores and some of the respiratory tract symptoms associated with human exposures. A series of experimental, hypothesis-driven studies is proposed to identify mechanisms underlying these differences in inflammatory response outcome. Using cell and/or in vivo rat models of lung disease, the present study proposes to determine whether a) diversity in inflammatory lung responses due to exposure to toxins from damp building associated fungi are a manifestation of differences in the sensitivity and/or inflammatory mediator expression in toxin-exposed primary rat lungs cells, b) toxin exposures perturb inflammatory gene expression and inflammatory mediator interactions amongst lung cells in toxin specific ways, and c) inflammatory gene response and toxicokinetic diversity is reflected as differences in spatial inflammatory gene expression in toxin exposed rat lungs. The use of microarray and FISH experiments proposed herein represents a new and challenging approach to resolve basic, conceptual questions that concern mycotoxin induced  inflammatory lung disease onset. The work will advance our understanding of and provide novel insight into molecular mechanisms underlying lung disease caused by exposure to mycotoxins, and promote student training especially in mycology, immunotoxicology, experimental design and microscopy.

"Several diseases such as diabetes, arteriosclerosis, and hypertension affect the blood vessels in the retina of the eye. Specifically, the shape, width, and tortuosity of the vessels are modified by the disease processes. Similar changes are also seen in premature infants, in a condition known as retinopathy of prematurity. In addition, images of the retina can reveal the presence of pathological features, such as exudates, microaneurysms, hemorrhages, venous beading, and neovascularization. Quantitative analysis of the architecture of the vasculature of the retina and changes as above could assist in the monitoring of the stage of the disease processes, as well as in evaluating the effects of treatment. We propose to develop digital image processing and pattern analysis techniques for computer-aided detection and quantitative analysis of features as above in order to assist in the assessment of the related pathological processes by opthalmologists and other clinical specialists.



The project will include the development of algorithms to analyze the shape, width, and tortuosity of blood vessels using shape factors, measures of complexity, and fractal analysis. The methods will be designed to facilitate longitudinal quantitative analysis to aid follow-up of patients with retinal pathology and assessment of the effect of treatment. The methods will be tested with publicly available databases of retinal images, as well as with images obtained from  the Alberta Children's Hospital.

"The present proposal concerns the development of suitable methods and  techniques that will facilitate concrete calculations with a new algebraic machinery called Hopf cyclic cohomology. This apparatus was invented  by Connes and Moscovici in the process of computing characteristic invariants for geometric spaces defined in terms of non-commuting coordinates (as they appear in quantum physics. Their work brought to light the importance of a specific type of symmetry in dealing with non-commutative coordinates, encoded by objects called Hopf algebras. Our proposal focuses on a class of such objects, which are closely related to classical groups of symmetries with infinitely many parameters, discovered by Sophus Lie and studied by Elie Cartan about 100 years ago). We propose to develop appropriate algebraic (homological) tools that will allow the explicit computation of their Hopf cyclic cohomology. There are two categories of classical groups: flat and non-flat. In the flat case, we associate a sophisticated Hopf algebra, called a bicrossed product Hopf algebra, to the group in question. Such a Hopf algebra is made of two minor Hopf algebras. The next step is to develop homological tools for computing the Hopf cyclic cohomology of the Hopf algebra by using the homology of the minor Hopf algebras. We show that the Hopf cyclic cohomology of the Hopf algebra is the same as the Gelfand-Fuks cohomology of the Lie algebra of the group. The non-flat case is a  different situation. The associated Hopf algebra seems to be more sophisticated; unlike the flat case, it is not of bicrossed product form. Instead, it seems to be a new algebraic construction  made of an algebra and a coalgebra together with some interactions and compatibilities between them. This opens a window to a new theory involving the theory of  Hopf algebras, Hopf cyclic cohomology and transversal geometry. We proposed to develop  new theories and tools to study these  new Hopf algebras from the Hopf cyclic cohomology point of view.

"For the next few years, the main focus of my research will be on developing statistical techniques for constructing and analyzing designs (sets of input settings) for industrial experiments and experiments involved in investigating complex physical phenomena.



In many branches of physical science (e.g., oceanography, climatology), when complex physical phenomena are very expensive or time-consuming to observe, observations from their corresponding computer models are used in addition for a better understanding of the underlying processes. An interesting research problem is to

design experiments for the combined process, which is desired due to limited resources and time constraints. I also plan to use the growing computing power (e.g., parallel programming tools) to find designs that are optimal for experiments with pre-determined goals. This research will be useful in many areas of physical science when the true physical phenomena are either very expensive or infeasible to observe. For example, atmospheric scientists may wish to identify target levels of man-made pollutants that result in global temperature change of no more than 2 degrees celsius.



Similarly, limitations on resources in industrial settings generates the demand for constructing useful experimental designs. In addition, it is often desirable to impose restrictions on the way experimental runs are performed, for example, in ndustrial experiments with multiple stages. It turns out that good designs for such experiments is not straightforward to find, however can be constructed using some finite projective geometric tools. I intend to develop both the theoretical results that confirms the existence and algorithms for constructing efficient multi-stage designs that are useful for practitioners.

"Although many researchers focus on the mechanisms of long-term memory, there are fewer researchers who focus on the mechanisms of short-term memory.  The objectives of the research described in this proposal are to focus on discovering the mechanisms underlying short-term memory for a very simple form of learning, habituation in a very simple model system, the nematode C. elegans. Habituation involves learning to ignore stimuli that are repeated and that do not have any meaning (i.e. traffic sounds, the sound of a fan in the room, the movement of leaves on a tree).  All animals can learn this.  We will approach studying the mechanism of this type of learning at the level of behaviour, at the level of the neural circuit and at the level of genes.  For the behavioural aspects of the proposed research we will try to break the behaviour down into its component parts in order to investigate which features in addition to interstimulu interval (stimulus frequency), response magnitude and response frequency of habituation are independently mediated.  At the level of the neurons we will use tools to assess gene activation in identified neurons (ie. green fluorescent protein, Western blots, quantitative real time PCR, transgenic cell specific rescues of mutations) to focus on whether the mechanisms mediating different aspects of habituation are in the sensory neurons or the interneurons in origin.  Finally at the level of the gene we will use a genetic screen to identify a large number of genes that play a role in habituation in C. elegans. In addition we will analyze classical conditioning in the mutants we identify to see whether genes that affect habituation also affect classical conditioning.  In this way we will investigate the relationship between habituation and classical conditioning.

     The primary aim of this research program is to advance the state of understanding and application of Ranque-Hilsch (vortex) tube devices.  The vortex tube is a very simple, non-moving part, pneumatic device that separates cold fluid from hot fluid for cooling purposes.  It utilizes compressed gas, injected tangentially into the vortex tube to establish a strong swirling flow.  There is still controversy over the physical explanation of the operation of these devices. In addition, experimental measurements of the internal flow field of the devices are extremely difficult due to the strong vortex flow.  Recent experiments conducted, in our laboratory, show that the cooling effect only occurs at Reynolds numbers consistent with turbulence. This work leads to the question of whether subjecting the device to a pulsating supply flow would result in the desired energy separation. 

     Comprehensive experimental and numerical studies conducted to determine the performance characteristics of these devices, operating with various types of unsteady supply excitation are planned.  Various methods of generating the unsteady supply flow will be investigated including a conventional rotary valve pulsator as well as synthetic jet injector.  The effects of a number of variables including the device geometry, the frequency, amplitude and shape of the pulsations are to be determined as well as the effect of humidity.  In addition, a detailed investigation of the internal flow field of the vortex tube will be conducted to compare with the numerical results. 

     Improved micro-scale vortex tubes have practical application as novel cooling devices for electronic components.  The fundamental studies planned are novel in that they will provide a significant contribution to understanding the operation of micro-scale and macro-scale vortex tubes.  Independent studies of the synthetic jet injectors to drive these devices will also advance the state of micro-scale jet pump technology.

"Sample surveys are widely used to provide reliable statistics (estimates) on a variety of important topics (e.g., monthly unemployment rates and measures of health status of people). Measures of variability associated with these statistics are also needed in assessing their quality. Commonly used measures include standard errors and confidence intervals. Survey data are also extensively used to study relationships among variables and to test the validity of hypotheses. Surveys are increasingly used to provide small area statistics which are needed in formulating policies and programs.  My research program will focus on all the above aspects of sample surveys. In particular, I will study the following problems:

(a) Traditional estimates for small areas, based on area specific data, are not reliable due to small sample sizes in small areas.  Indirect estimates that utilize information from related areas are therefore used to increase the reliability. I have done extensive work on this topic, particularly model-based estimates and associated standard errors. I propose to continue this work, focussing on realistic models, measurement errors, missing data and other features.

(b) Item non-response often occurs in surveys and imputation is commonly used to handle missing data. Methods of making valid inferences under imputation will be studied.

(c) Longitudinal surveys are widely used to study underlying dynamics and to get more efficient estimates. In the past, I have studied methods for cross-sectional surveys that take account of complex survey design features such as clustering and unequal weights. I will extend these methods to longitudinal surveys. These results will be applied to data from longitudinal surveys conducted by Statistics Canada.

"The objective of the proposed program of research is to study the development of mathematics and working memory in young children. Working memory involves immediate short-term storage of information in memory. Working memory is an important factor for doing mathematics among both children and adults and those who have specific difficulty in mathematics (e.g., children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder). Thus, I propose to conduct a longitudinal study exploring the relation between working memory and mathematics among young children (aged 4 to 8 years) both with and without FASD. I also intend to specifically study how young children represent information in working memory by examining the types of memory strategies young children use at different ages (visual vs. verbal) and whether this strategy use is related to executive functioning and literacy skills. The proposed projects will be the first longitudinal evaluation of working memory and arithmetic from preschool through the school-age years. Studying the relation between working memory and mathematics in young children and in special populations (e.g., FASD) provides important insights about the psychological processes that are evoked when children do mathematics. The second project will help us determine the cognitive skills that are involved in the transition from visual to verbal coding in young children. Studying development of children with FASD helps us understand cognitive development in general, as well as the nature of individual differences in cognitive development.","Not available","University of Alberta",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Science cognitive -- d�veloppement",Psychologie
"Revenue management is the study of deciding how a firm should decide on prices and inventory levels in order to optimize some quantities,usually revenue or profit. The classical example is an airline which must decide on the price it is going to charge for tickets, let us say for a flight from Toronto to Vancouver. The process of selling tickets

usually starts at least six months before the date of departure. One approach is for the airline to sell the tickets fairly cheaply as soon as possible in order to make sure that all tickets are sold since an unsold ticket is worthless as soon as the plane departs. However, business people often require a ticket with very little warning close

to the departure date. These tickets can be sold for a much higher price, so the question is what is the optimal price structure as a

function of time. This is a complex problem especially since a realistic demand model usually will contain a stochastic term. This

type of analysis can be applied to many different products and services, for which the good cannot be stored.

"Climate change will have significant impact on the Canadian society. Global climate models (GCMs) are the main tool used to predict changes in variables such as temperature and precipitation. Current GCMs unfortunately have very coarse resolution, making direct model output unsuitable for many local or regional impact studies. Various downscaling techniques have been proposed to increase the level of detail of regional climate change scenarios. 



The general objective of this research program is to contribute to the development of statistical downscaling techniques for climate change studies. The particular focus of the research is the development of techniques for stochastic weather generation. Current weather generators have certain limitations, including their inability to preserve the spatial correlation between multiple sites in a region and their inability to reproduce interannual variability. In addition, there are also some questions as to how weather generators should be conditioned on GCM simulated climate change. 



The research program will address the shortcomings of current stochastic weather generators and proposes the development of a computer model that integrates a range of weather generation techniques for use in climate change studies. This will be of both theoretical and practical value to Canada where climate change is expected to have significant impact on key sectors such as agriculture and hydropower.

"Although the basic mechanism of retroviral integration was resolved and although the necessity of the viral integrase in this process was clearly demonstrated, the contribution of the host in this process is not clearly defined. Several cofactors of the retroviral integrase were identified by various methods, but questions remain as for the efficiency of the integration, the selection of site of integration, the repair of the intermediaries of integration and the in vivo inhibition of the reverse reaction of the integration, the disintegration. Furthermore, the differences observed between retrovirus during this process, notably in view of the selection of the sites of integration of the viral genome in the genome of the host, suggest the intervention of cellular cofactors specific of the virus.

Our short-term purpose is the identification and the characterization of new cellular partners of the integrases of the virus of the human immunodeficiency of type 1, and of Graffi and Cas-Br-E murine leukemia viruses. Our long-term goal is to clarify the mechanism of integration, to bring to light differences at the level of the interaction of the integrase with host proteins according to the virus and to answer the remaining questions. The knowledge of the interactions between the host and the virus during the process of integration should create not only new tools for gene studies (targeting of gene) but also new developments in engineering, particularly in the field of gene therapy based on the use of retroviral vectors. Indeed, the possibility of targeting exactly specific regions of the host genome should contribute to increase the efficiency of these approaches and to eliminate the risk of the cancer due to insertional oncogene activation. Furthermore, this should have a major impact in the field of antiviral therapies by offering a tremendous platform for the selection of new antiviral targets and for the elaboration of new drugs against retroviral infections.

"Neural Stem Cells (NSC) are primary progenitors isolated from mammalian Central Nervous System (CNS) at the embryonic and adult stage. They are valuable tools in novel strategies of gene therapy for human diseases including nervous system repair and regeneration. These cells can be cultured, grown, expanded and propagated in vitro followed by reimplantion into the pediatric and adult nervous system. HOX proteins are highly conserved transcription factors and master regulators of embryonic neurogenesis with key roles in different types of human cancer including brain tumor. They are highly conserved transcription factors organizing the early embryo along the body axis through transcriptional regulation of developmentally important target genes. In mammals, 39 Hox genes exist under a tightly regulated spatial and temporal expression pattern during embryogenesis. They are involved in embryonic neurogenesis, embryonic stem (ES) cell fate decisions and contribute in generating neurons/motor neurons and glial cells; however their role in NSC neurogenesis is not established. Therefore, the main objective of this program is to conduct a comprehensive study of HOX/HOX-cofactors/HOX-targets in NSC neurogenesis and to delineate the HOX regulatory network during NSC differentiation. We will use a combination of bioinformatic approaches and molecular genetics techniques to identify the involved HOX/HOX direct targets in differentiated NSC and will perform functional studies. Modulating the expression of HOX proteins and their cofactors, we will investigate the effects on stem cell properties such as self renewal, plasticity and neuronal differentiation. HOX proteins have been detected in different types of brain tumor and among these tumors; stem cells have been isolated in glioblastoma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma. As brain tumor stem cells (BTSC) share similar signaling pathways and cell surface markers with NSC; these findings would be beneficial towards understanding the link between normal neuronal development and brain tumor. The data will also have applications in regenerative medicine, in generating defined populations of differentiated NSC.","Medical and health sciences","University of Manitoba",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","R�gulation des g�nes","Biologie mol�culaire"

"A significant threat to military and humanitarian personnel and structures is blast's pressure wave. With Canada increased involvement in peace operations, there is an urgent need for developing blast protection systems. Foam-type viscoelastic materials have been widely used to reduce vibration, noise, and stresses in aerospace, military, marine, automobile, and medical industries due to their superior ability to absorb and dissipate energy in different forms, as well as their unique stress-strain relation. Recent studies showed that they can also be used to enhance the blast resisting capacity of structures if the system is properly designed. To design the most efficient and effective blast protection systems, the material properties of each component must be known and its dynamic behaviour must be well understood. A review of existing literature reveals that, due to the wide variety of their forms and the broad range of their mechanical behaviours, more exploration is needed to determine their dynamic properties as well as the techniques used to identify them. In general, the techniques to characterize their properties for blast or impact applications are the modified split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) test and the vibration tests. The modified SHPB test is based on wave propagation theory of linear viscoelastic bars. In this research, a semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) method will be used in the study of wave propagation in linear viscoelastic bars. An experiment will be set up to validate the results of the SAFE method before the actual modified SHPB test is conducted. For vibration tests, LS-Dyna, a finite element software for nonlinear large deformations, will be used to investigate the behaviour of foam-type viscoelastic samples before the vibration tests are carried out. The short- to medium-term objectives of this study are to thoroughly investigate and appropriately modify the techniques used to identify dynamic properties of foam-type viscoelastic solids and to develop appropriate mathematical models of these materials. The long-term objective of this project is the development of an effective blast protection system using these mathematical models.",Engineering,"University of Manitoba",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie civil","G�nie civil"
"Effective and efficient energy distribution plays a vital role in maintaining a good quality of life for Canadians. In Manitoba, the main source of energy is from hydro-electric plants and the distribution of energy is, for the most part, through the use of transmission tower-line systems. These structures must withstand exposure to the province's harsh weather. Failure of a single tower can cause cascading damage to several adjacent towers and result in not only the disruption of service to the users but also economic losses. Past studies on transmission tower structures have emphasised either the tower itself or the behaviour of the cables. Not many research projects have considered the transmission tower-line as a whole. This may be due to the fact that detailed modeling of a transmission tower requires a vast amount of computational effort. Apart from the studies of the effects of a broken conductor, cascading failure of a transmission tower-line system has not received sufficient attention in the past. The aim of the present project is to attain a simplified transmission tower-line system that can be used in the investigation of cascading failure of transmission tower-line systems. The results of the study will help designers to understand cascading behaviour of transmission tower-line systems so that they are better able to optimize the design of new transmission lines and assess the risk of failure on existing lines.

"Strong observational evidence points towards the existence of large amounts of matter in the Universe that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WMIPs) are prime candidates to explain this dark matter.

The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment employs cryogenic germanium detectors with active background discrimination to search for the very rare interactions of WIMPs with ordinary matter. With the latest published data, CDMS has the world best sensitivity for this type of interaction. No WIMP interaction has been detected yet, but the results constrain theoretical models that describe the parameters of these particles.

The next phase of this experiment, SuperCDMS, is planned to expand the target mass from presently ~ 5 kg in steps to roughly 150 kg over the next 4-5 years to improve the sensitivity by roughly two orders of magnitude. Funds for a first moderate increase (to ~ 10 kg) are already available. Funds are requested for a further increase of the target mass, as well as for a relocation of the experiment to the new SNOLAB facility in northern Ontario, which provides a better shielding against cosmic radiation and an overall better environment for the experiment.

This proposal supports the Canadian participation in this cutting edge research by providing the funds for two graduate students and one postdoctoral fellow to be employed at Queen's. They will be trained by involving them in setting up and running a detector testing facility aiming at understanding and characterizing the new SuperCDMS detectors as well as developing and testing novel detector concepts which will eventually lead to a large target mass experiment.

They will also participate in the analysis of the dark matter search data and the on-site operation of the experiment at its present location in the Soudan Underground Laboratory in northern Minnesota (US).

"Overwhelming observational evidence tells us, that what we see in the Universe is only a small fraction of the existing matter. Most of the matter is not only invisible, but of a completely new type. The search for this ""Dark Matter"" is one of the most fascinating and challenging experimental efforts pursued in present day fundamental physics research.

     Dark Matter particles are expected to only very rarely interact with ordinary matter. Therefore the influence of other interacting particle (cosmic radiation, natural radioactivity) has to be reduced as much as possible when searching for these particles. CDMS (Cryogenic Dark Matter Search) which is presently world-leading in this field  operates very sensitive low temperature (cryogenic) detectors deep underground to reduce the influence of cosmic radiation, and inside a heavy shielding against trace radioactivity in the surroundings. The complex detectors are capable of distinguishing between the expected interactions from the Dark Matter particles and interactions from known particles which despite all the effort manage to penetrate the shielding.

     CDMS is planning to move for the next phase (""SuperCDMS"") to the newly built SNOLAB near Sudbury, Ontario, which provides better shielding against cosmic radiation and a cleaner (with respect to radioactive trace contaminations) environment than the present location of the CDMS experiment

     This project contributes to the CDMS experiment by setting up and running a facility which will provide the low temperatures and all electronics necessary to operate the complex CDMS detectors. This facility will be used to test and characterize the detectors that are presently being developed for the next phase of the experiment, before they are deployed in the final setup. The close connection between Queen's University and SNOLAB will greatly benefit the installation of the experiment at the new site. This project allows a significant Canadian contribution to a world-leading experiment in cutting edge fundamental research.

"My research focuses on the characterization of the composition and crystal structure of minerals and materials. The purpose of these studies is to clarify geological processes, to map the pathways by which these processes occur, and to characterize new types of materials fundamental to high-technology industry. This proposal has three principle directions.

(1) Experimental mineralogy and crystal chemistry.  This aspect of my work focuses on the characterization of new minerals, and minerals for which the crystal structures are unknown, e.g., dypingite, so that we can measure the amount of atmospheric CO2 bound within mine tailings. In addition, the crystal chemistry of new synthetic alkali germanoarsenates and galloarsenates is investigated to better understand the coordination chemistry of germanium and gallium in an arsenic environment in nature, and also because of the potential to discover new open-framework materials.

(2) Application of Rietveld  analysis to mining and environmental problems. My research is also useful for the characterization of mine wastes. This work seeks to identify new mineral hosts for CO2 and to develop more efficient pathways by which CO2 may be fixed in an active industrial environment. Carbon sequestration in geological reservoirs is a way to stabilize anthropogenic CO2 emissions linked to global climate change.  The Rietveld method is used to both characterize the crystal structures of these minerals and to quantify their amount. This research will help to develop new techniques with broad applications to mineralogy and geochemistry.

(3) Application of experimental mineralogy to novel materials. I apply mineralogical methods to photoluminescent nanoparticles to characterize the crystal structure and crystallite size. These materials are useful for planar waveguides, flat panel displays and fiber amplifiers.

"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neuronal condition of old age that afflicts 10% of the population over the age of 65.  It is incurable and results in death usually within 10 years after a painful period of degeneration.  It is brought about by the death of nerve cells caused largely by the action of a single small peptide (42-residues), the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) in aggregated form, most likely with bound, redox active, copper.  Abeta's assault on neurons is multipronged.  The redox-active copper generates superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, and destroys membranes by initiating lipid peroxidation.  The oligomeric form is toxic via a wide variety of mechanisms. For some time we have been applying sophisticated computer modeling to study the fundamental chemistry of the species involved under physiologically relevant conditions.  We have examined many aspects of the chemistry of Abeta and its association with the metal, copper. After two years of computer simulation, we have a structure of Abeta itself. We and others believe that the weak link in the complex chain of events leading to neuronal death is the assembly of Abeta into oligomers, and we have expended considerable effort into the design of compounds that will bind specifically to monomeric Abeta. We have designed several families of drug-candidates, and synthesized and tested two of them for their ability to prevent oligomerization and possibly prevent, or at least slow down the progression of, Alzheimer's disease.  The present proposal continues our AD chemistry investigation by examining computationally the thermodynamics of peptide-peptide interactions focusing on our drug candidates and targeted segments of Abeta.  We also propose to examine the structure of a membrane composed of docosahexaenoic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is very common in in the brain, its permeability to small species like NO, O2, CO, and H2O2, and its affinity for Abeta.  We also propose to study small aggregates of Abeta with bound copper to ascertain their ability to cause restriction of the blood supply to the brain, in order to confirm the hypothesized connection between AD and vascular dementia that we published as the ABSENT hypothesis.","Physical sciences","University of Calgary",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Chimie quantique ou par mod�lisation num�rique","Physique et chimie th�oriques"

"Quantum computation promises a much faster processing of information than is possible classically. Specifically, a drastically better scaling of computational resources such as run-time and number of elementary operations can be achieved with a quantum computer. In some cases the speed-up is exponential which e.g. enables Shor's factoring algorithm to break the RSA crypto system. However, a quantum computer as a physical device is necessarily imperfect and susceptible to noise resulting from uncontrolled interaction with its environment. If not counteracted, these decoherence effects within a short period of action jeopardize any quantum mechanical processing of information. In response, methods to counteract decoherence have been developed, leading to the theoretical viability of quantum error-correction and fault-tolerant quantum computation. The ability to perform quantum error correction is critical to building a scalable quantum computer. The devised methods now need to be brought into the realm of experimental reality. 



This research proposal sets out to advance the field of fault-tolerant quantum computation for several computational models. We develop efficient methods for quantum error-correction and aim at bridging the gap between theory and experiment. Specifically, we bring a promising scheme for fault-tolerant quantum computation closer to experimental realization in physical systems such as optical lattices, ion traps and superconducting qubit arrays. Further, for the models of adiabatic quantum computation and quantum cellular automata, where the theory of quantum error-correction is less advanced, we aim at proving a so-called threshold theorem establishing fault-tolerance in these models.

"Dissolved and colloidal organic carbon materials that enter a lake from its surrounding catchment (allochthonous carbon) are likely to have a major effect on aquatic food webs, and are known to be highly sensitive to climate change. This program is to study boreal, subarctic and arctic lakes that are a prominent feature of northern landscapes and that contribute significantly to northern biodiversity. Specifically the research will focus on the control and nature of carbon which is the basis for all living creatures, and subsequent food web structure in lakes. The program will center on the overarching hypothesis that surrounding soils and vegetation strongly influence the water column carbon characteristics, microbial food web structure and higher food web processes. The project will determine the effects of allochthonous carbon on the balance between algal photosynthesis and bacterial production that influences microbial food web and mineralization processes, and subsequently food availability to higher trophic levels. The project will determine 1) the relative changes in the carbon sources (phytoplankton, algae growing on the bottom of the water body and bacteria) in lakes across an extensive temperature gradient in eastern Canada; and 2) the implications of these different sources for animals higher in the food web (zooplankton). The program includes eight independent but closely interlinked objectives that will form the basis of three graduate student projects and that will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the food web structure and its driving forces in aquatic ecosystem. It will harness the use of advanced ecosystem monitoring techniques, including the evaluation of water column carbon properties by synchronous fluorescence scans and trophic structure determination by stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. A part of the sampling and field measurements will be carried out during winter, a season that has been largely neglected in aquatic studies due to the logistic difficulties of working at subzero temperatures.","Inland waters","Universit� du Qu�bec � Chicoutimi",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","�cologie aquatique et limnologie","�volution et �cologie"

"The rapidly evolving energy crisis provides an increased impetus for developing appropriate shaping processes for light alloys in the automotive and aerospace industries. Magnesium alloys are ~33% lighter than aluminum alloys and ~75% lighter than steel. This research program proposes to build upon extensive and  pioneering research experience and knowledge in conventional and novel casting processes to develop magnesium alloys comparable to aluminum alloys in castability, minimal defects and superior in-service properties. It seeks to develop an enhanced understanding of the origin of casting defects and the role of various inclusions and other microstctural features with a view to improving melt cleanliness, heat flow  and fillability. Also, it will result in an improvement of the the high temperature properties of magnesium alloys through suitable combination of alloying additions. Further, it seeks a better understanding of hot tearing during solidification of light alloys through  measurement of associated residual strains and iterative modelling based on actual process parameters. It is envisaged that this can enable development of reliable criterion functions for predicting hot tear susceptibility.

"Disposal of waste sludge is a major economical factor in operation of wastewater treatment plants. Sludge or biosolids processing and management costs account for 50%-60% of the overall wastewater treatment costs. Anaerobic digestion, which is the most widely used sludge stabilization process worldwide, breaks down about 40-50% of the organic matter of the sludge to form valuable biogas (methane) and to reduce pathogen content of the sludge prior to disposal. A disadvantage of the traditional digestion process is the slow sludge hydrolysis rate requiring large volume digesters.  The proposed research will address this by introducing oxidative pretreatment of the sludge. Various combinations of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) that are known as in-situ producers of hydroxyl radicals in practical quantities will be used for biosolids pretreatment.  The objective of this project is to determine optimum sludge pretreatment conditions that will reduce the volume of anaerobic digesters with additional benefits such as higher biogas production, control of hydrogen sulfide and odor in the biogas, reduced scaling due to struvite and/or vivianite precipitation, improved dewaterability of sludge and enhanced sludge stabilization with respect to both complex organic compounds such as endocrine disruptive compounds (EDC) and pathogens. 

The proposed research will produce new knowledge on scientific issues such as the impact of AOP pretreatment on hydrolysis rate of complex protein, fat and organosulphur compounds present in the sludge, and the effect of pretreatment on the size distribution and dewaterability of the sludge.  This knowledge would translate into the engineering design of better digester systems with integrated AOP pretreatment systems, and development of a mathematical model for scaling up of such a process.  This research will benefit the Canadian wastewater treatment industry by improving the biosolids management with respect to superior dewaterability of sludge, higher biogas production, and enhanced sludge stabilization for various end uses.",Water,"University of Western Ontario",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","G�nie de l'environnement","G�nie de l'environnement"
"With the increasing world-wide demand on natural resources, existing technologies are not adequate to protect sustainable development; new technologies and more cost effective solutions are always needed. Municipal waste water effluents are the major source of pollutants in natural water due to their complex nature because of human waste and a variety of chemicals that come from both individual and industrial activities. Lately, they are also recognized to be a source of endocrine disrupting substances, which need to be removed for the reclamation and reuse of water.  Similarly, the sludge generated from wastewater requires various treatment processes before it can be applied to agricultural lands as a final disposal method. The proposed research is directed toward developing novel and cost-effective advanced treatment technologies and design approach addressing some of the above issues with the following objectives: (i) degradation and removal of endocrine disruptor compounds present in water works and natural environments, (ii) novel application of advanced oxidation for the pretreatment of municipal sludge to improve solubulization of the sludge during anaerobic digestion and subsequent greater volume reduction and stabilization facilitating its disposal as agricultural soil, and (iii) application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for efficient design of sludge dryer. The major innovations involved with the proposed research include the development and optimization of the relevant treatment technologies, development of kinetic and mechanistic models of degradation of environmental chemicals, design of novel reactor systems with improved energy distribution and efficient hydrodynamics, and development of efficient CFD models for multiphase flow with heat and mass transfer. In addition, the proposed research will have the long term goals of contributing to the reaction kinetic data base of the environmental compounds for  environmental modelers and engineers and develop an efficient integrated sludge management system.

"Image segmentation and object tracking are two fundamental tasks upon which several automated image analysis and computer vision applications rely. Ideally, image segmentation and object tracking algorithms should make use of available information as much as possible. The information about the objects of interest or segments typically can be geometric or topological (e.g., shape, size, solidity or hollowness etc), as well as some image-based characteristics (e.g., intensity/color/texture). Spatial point process techniques, a tool-set from probability and statistics, utilize these pieces of information in a theoretically sound Bayesian framework. However, the drawback of point process techniques is non-efficient computation. On the deterministic side, level set methods, which were originally introduced as numerical techniques for front propagation, are computationally efficient in image segmentation and object tracking. However, level set methods are not as versatile as the point process methods in terms of utilizing the information about the objects/segments. In this research I aim to merge these two fascinating image analysis tools together to complement each other. This marriage of the two methods is a novel concept and is proposed in a theoretically sound stochastic sampling framework. The anticipated outcome of this research is a computationally efficient yet generic image segmentation and object tracking tool.","Oil, gas and coal","University of Alberta",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Traitement des images","Technologie de l'information"

"Si grands qu'aient �t� les progr�s technologiques accomplis au cours des derni�res ann�es, il reste encore amplement de potentiel de d�veloppement inexploit�.

"The objective of this proposal is to study electronic, magnetic and superconductivity of bulk and thin films of ceramic oxides and metal intercalated compounds. The main focus of my research will be on transition metal oxides (perovskite structure) which have shown rich and extraordinary physical properties that are technologically important, such as high TC superconductors and manganites. In some perovskite, the orbital degrees of freedom of electrons in conjunction with the strong coupling between their spin and orbit affect their magnetic and conducting properties. For example, perovskite, LaVO3 undergoes a structural and anti-ferromagnetic phase transition at low temperature with different orbital and spin ordering in the new phase. Another interesting compound is PrCoO3 (possible uses in electrochemica devices) which is an insulator with no magnetic transition. However, slight replacement (doping) of La with Sr or Ca causes this material to show large magneto-resististance (MR) with a small magnetic field. I am proposing to do the following research on how strain as well as external pressures affect the electronic and magnetic properties of the bulk and films of LaVO3 as well as Pr(1-x)SrxCoO3. This will allow us to investigate and to see whether or not we can use the thin films of these materials for possible application.

My secondary objective is to study superconductivity by putting metals in-between carbon layers in graphite (intercalated graphite MC6, M=metal). Graphite is a layered compound where carbon atoms are strongly bounded in planes and weakly bounded out of plane. One can put different metals between these planes which is called intercalation. By doing this, we can change the electronic properties of graphite, for example, by intercalating Ca (calcium) it becomes, superconductor at low temperature. What we are planning to do is intercalate a variety of atoms in graphite and observe how its electronic and magnetic properties change. This will help us understand why intercalated graphite becomes a superconductor.

"The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates various developmental and stress-induced processes in plants. Several ABA response genes encode for RNA-binding or RNA-processing proteins, and recent studies on Arabidopsis ABA-sensitivity mutants have shown ABA involvement in post-transcriptional mRNA processing. Arabidopsis genome encodes more than 200 putative RNA-binding proteins; half of which are plant-specific. RNA-binding proteins mediate mRNA synthesis, splicing, transport, translation and degradation and by influencing transcript abundance, RNA-binding proteins provide a major regulatory role in fine-tuning cellular protein expression.

Our knowledge of plant RNA-binding proteins is very limited and only a few plant RNA-binding proteins are characterized, with little or no information available on the mechanism by which their action is regulated. Most of the studied RNA-binding proteins in plants are directly or indirectly linked to ABA.

I have identified the RNA binding protein, Flowering Time Control Locus A (FCA), as the first ABA receptor in plants and provided the first direct link of a plant hormone to RNA processing.

Through this research program, I seek to understand the mechanisms by which ABA regulates RNA processing in plant cells. The objectives of this research are to investigate possible involvement of ABA in regulating RNA processing, determining of RNA binding specificity, and in the interactions of the RNA-binding proteins. This research will comprise both in vivo and in vitro studies, utilizing two ABA receptor proteins, the Arabidopsis FCA and its cereal homologue, ABAP1. My research program will contribute to the existing knowledge on the mechanisms that regulate gene expression and will be the first to look at hormonal regulation of RNA metabolism in plants. My research progrm will have immediate and far-reaching impacts on the fundamental processes of plant growth and development, and can be applied to select for agriculturally important crops that possess high-yield potential and exert high tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses.

"To meet the current and future emissions standards for Diesel Engines it is necessary to able to electonically control in an holistic manner the operation of the engine, the methods of getting the fuel into the engine (injection techniques) and any exhaust aftertreatment device. As part of this overall requirement this research will concentrate on how the methods of fuelling and fuelling control effects the engine performance and emissions. The technique of multi-pulse injection has been identified as an effective way to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions. However, the heat release rates associated with low NOx and low PM requirments cause departures from engine conditions which normally maximize the energy efficiency of the combustion process. There is a need to balance in an effective manner emissions with energy-use efficency. Thus, the main aim will be to develop an analytic model to assess the performance of multi-pulse fuel injection in modern diesel engines. To calibrate and validate this model the transient thermal and combustion characteristics of the engine cycle will be examined empirically on a prototype common-rail diesel engine controlled by a sophisticated a field programmable gate array (FPGA) based system integrated with an embedded controller and a sophisticated programmable power drive. The detailed temporal profiles of cylinder gas pressure, temperature, and composition will be measured with cylinder pressure transducers, fast-response temperature sensors, and in-cylinder direct gas sampling analyzers. In this way it will be possible to investigate the fundamental trade-offs of the energy efficiency versus the fuel injection schedule when ultra low emission combustion is targeted.","Energy efficiency","University of Windsor",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie a�rospatial, a�ronautique et automobile","G�nie m�canique"

behavioural differences among individuals, has been studied in psychology for decades. Ecologists, however, have only recently discovered that personality was a general characteristics of animal populations. I use behavioural tests and genetics on marked individuals to illustrate the effects of the environment on the survival and reproduction of individuals with different personalities and to show why personality differences exist. With this research, I also try to increase our knowledge on the role of personality in the response of natural animal populations to rapid changes in their environment.

"Synthetic organic chemistry yields routes to change the properties of plant oils and many are well known but few of the processes can be made inexpensive enough to be applied to industrial practice. It is necessary, therefore, to reduce these processes to practice in order to produce the wide variety of value-added consumer and industrial products. The approach of this proposal is to develop more efficient industrial processes for converting vegetable oils to improved consumer and industrial products. The vegetable oils used in novel syntheses will be derived from Canadian crops with unique chemistry and/or low cost including canola, flax, high-oleic canola, solin flax, coriander, camelina and rapeseed. 

  Modified oils will be tested for relevant chemical and physical properties but it is not the intention of this research to formulate new products. Formulation of new products will be conducted by an array of Canadian companies and university collaborators who are currently studying and developing new products. When efficient syntheses and concentration methods are developed quantities of products sufficient for evaluation by collaborators will be prepared. This in kind or cash contribution will be supplied separately through collaboration.

  Processes will be developed to inexpensively convert vegetable oils to products that: 1) remain liquid at low temperature (-40C); 2) have low viscosity (<4 cP); 3) have high viscosity (>200 cP); have high polarity; 4)have low polarity; 5) have enhanced oxidative stability (>10 h AOM).

  Patented methods and trade secrets have been developed by the applicant to prepare alkyl esters and conjugate fatty acids for industrial applications. The project will result in the training of a Ph.D. and M.Sc. candidates and summer students. While exploring Diels-Alder chemistry and the modification of lipid properties the students will be mentored by a supervisor with significant experience in industrial process design and intellectual property protection.","Industrial chemicals (solvents, resins)","University of Saskatchewan",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Synth�ses organiques","Chimie organique"
"Most commercial lubricants are produced as a combination of a viscous hydrocarbon base stock which contributes over 70% of the lubricant mass. Additives, that improve the lubricants performance and stability, make up the remainder of the composition. Vegetable oil base stocks are often superior lubricants when compared with petroleum equivalents but have notable poor performance under certain conditions. In a recent breakthrough Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) and U of Saskatchewan scientists have discovered that the bulk of lubricity of vegetable oils is contributed by minor components present in the oil. AAFC has applied for patents to protect the intellectual property embodied in this discovery and in particular methods of enriching the highly lubricious compounds.

In this proposal the lubricity enhancing components of vegetable oil, and more particularly canola and mustard oil, will be analyzed to further understand the mechanisms of these unusual plant compounds. It is likely that the research will lead to further improvements in lubricating compounds and the development of lubricant additives that are less toxic and more biodegradable than those currently produced by industry.

The lubricity additives and vegetable oil basestocks will be tested for their performance in experimental conditions and in real-world tests. The ability of the lubricants to protect wear surfaces will be conducted at the Canadian Light Source where wear surfaces will be mapped and characterized. The goal will be to develop the knowledge of those methods that may be used to produce functional biolubricants to compete with petroleum based products.

Ultimately it is hoped that the knowledge gained will lead to advantitious chemistry that can be applied to canola and mustard oils and used by Canadian manufacturers to produce lubricity additives and base oils.

"The proposed research is two-fold. One project is focused on developing a passive water treatment reactor to reduce fluoride concentrations from industrial wastewater levels to drinking water standards. Our previous work developed a reactor that reduced fluoride in water from hundreds of mg/l to approximately 4 mg/l, but water of this concentration is still too high to avert the development of fluorosis in humans if ingested for long periods. Published data exists to show that low concentrations of citrate ion facilitate the sequestration of fluoride in calcite. Our research will integrate citrate's ability to remove fluoride with our previous reactor design. The objective is to develop a reliable and passive technique to reduce the fluoride concentration of any wastewater to drinking water standards (World Health Organization recommends < 1.5 mg/l). 

  The second project will examine the storage and reactivity of hydrogen gas (generated from anaerobic corrosion of zero-valent iron) in the lattice of palladium coatings on two mesoporous materials: MCM-41 (a recently-discovered form of SiO2) and nanophase hydroxyapatite (Ca5(PO4)3(OH)). The purpose of this research is to develop an additive, i.e. a support catalyst, to granular iron to improve its efficiency in groundwater remediation. Granular iron is currently widely used in the construction of permeable reactive barriers that are emplaced in the subsurface to produce non-toxic organics from toxic ones by way of reduction reactions. One important application is in the dehalogenation of toxic chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as tetrachloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE) and vinyl chloride (VC),

"Ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared light has an important influence on the behavior of electrons in solid, liquid and gaseous matter. This is the main origin of color, an important property of everyday items such as dyed textiles or colored paper. The properties of these electrons are also essential for many advanced devices, such as imaging systems, used in medical technology and many other areas.

This application describes a spectrometer allowing to measure the interactions of electrons in samples with light in the 180 nm to 1800 nm wavelength range, allowing us to gain insight on their energy levels and properties of the materials investigated. Such absorption spectra, often measured under conditions of variable temperature and pressure, are essential measurements for any colored materials and have been a mainstay of our research program since its start in 1991.

The data obtained with this instrument provide quantitative insight on the structure and chemical bonding in a vast range of materials. They are key quantities to describe and understand chemical and physical properties, allowing to optimize characteristics based on the experimental spectra, the key aspect of our research projects.

All students and collaborators of our research laboratory have measured absorption spectra using our previous generation instrument (purchased in 1992), making it the most used instrument in our laboratory, but it is no longer supported by the manufacturerer or any other technical specialist since November 2004. A current-generation replacement instrument is of key importance for the training of highly qualified personnel in our laboratory. The unique discoveries resulting from advanced, highly detailed absorption spectra obtained in the applicant's laboratory have been recognized, as illustrated e.g. by the 2007 Gerhard Herzberg Award by the Canadian Society for Analytical Sciences and Spectroscopy.

"Many of the combinatorial objects found at the interface between enumerative combinatorics and other fields, such as statistical physics, computer science and theoretical chemistry, are types of lattice animals. Lattice animals appear in models of polymers and vesicles, percolation models of phenomena such as forest fires, DNA denaturation and the Ising and Potts models of magnets.  Perhaps the most famous and versatile example is the self-avoiding walk, which was introduced by Orr over 50 years ago as a model of the geometric properties of long chain polymers.



The general aim of my research is to develop and apply combinatorial tools to find and explore solutions to lattice models; in particular, lattice models of polymers based on the self-avoiding walk. These studies will help us better understand physical properties of polymers. I will also use these techniques to address outstanding open problems in pattern-avoiding permutations. These objects have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years due to their links with problems in computer science and in the study of algebraic structures.","Mathematical sciences","University of British Columbia",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Combinatoire,"Math�matiques pures"

"The energy demand is growing worldwide and this has to be met with advanced energy technologies and energy conservation measures with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The most practical approach to address the greenhouse gas emissions is through a combination of alternative energy resources and advanced fossil fuel energy technologies. The applicant is one of the few researchers working in this field. The following three research projects are proposed to further advance their application to various industrial applications.

Project 1:  Biomass integrated gasification advanced combined cycle power generation systems: In the proposed work it is planned to investigate the role of gasification and operating conditions on plant work output and efficiency for a biomass integrated gasification combined cycle power generation unit. 

Project 2: Natural gas fired combined cycle power generation system with carbon dioxide capture and storage: The objectives of the work are to conduct performance simulations for a natural gas fired combined cycle power generation unit with carbon dioxide capture and storage. The effect of co-firing of biomass gasification fuel gas with natural gas in a combined cycle system, on plant performance and on carbon dioxide emissions will also be investigated. 

Project 3: Coal and biomass gasification based advanced power generation systems with carbon dioxide capture and storage: Research investigations are conducted to utilize coal, coal plus biomass through gasification in advanced power generation systems with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. In the present work research investigations will be conducted on the performance of biomass plus coal partial gasification and integrated gasification combined cycle power generation systems with carbon dioxide capture and storage. 

In addition to training of highly qualified personnel in the area of advanced biomass, natural gas and coal based energy technologies, the projects will provide scope for collaboration with energy based organizations and universities in Canada and around the world.

"Tuberculosis (TB) in humans is an extremely complex infection that is caused by the bacilli Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Despite more than half a century of effective chemotherapy, 100 million new TB infections still occur each year. In 2004, approximately 1.7 million people died worldwide as a result of this devastating disease. Clearly, this ongoing situation warrants new approaches to improve our current level of understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the bacterial-host relationship. 



To date, the majority of bacterial factors that are associated with virulence and pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis include various classes of waxes and glycolipids present in the lipid-rich bacterial cell wall. In addition, it has become increasingly apparent over recent years that M. tuberculosis lipids contribute to the development of strain diversity amongst circulating TB isolates. As such, the hypothesis of the proposed research program is that variable expression of lipids and lipid-modification strategies represents a major mechanism for the generation of pathogenic diversity in M. tuberculosis. An integral part of this program is also the demonstration of the mechanistic basis for the inflammatory processes that result from the interaction between host macrophages and differentially expressed M. tuberculosis lipids. 



This program provides an invaluable opportunity to start to define the range of strategies by which M. tuberculosis strains have independently evolved to adapt to and exploit the hostile macrophage environment within the host. It also provides a unique set of tools with which to expand our current knowledge of signaling pathways associated with innate immunity and inflammation, as well as ways to perturb these important pathways. The results of these studies will be directly applicable to understanding many critical aspects of host-pathogen biology and to the cell sciences in general.

"Research is proposed in a number of areas, with applications spanning a range of disciplines.  The research can be grouped under four headings: (i) statistical analysis of forest-fires past and present; (ii) applications of normal-Laplace distributions - this includes applications in medicine (survival analysis), engineering (reliability) and finance (including option pricing); (iii) modelling and analysis of phenomena with power-law tails, including statistical goodness of fit testing - applications here are widespread including complex networks with preferential attachment (e.g World Wide Web; networks of sexual partners etc.) and various size distributions such as those of biological taxa, incomes and city sizes; (iv) modelling and analysis for directional data - areas of application here include biology (directions of animal movement), meteorology (wind direction) and geology (orientation of fractures, magnetic fields etc.)



In all of the above areas the proposed research will involve both stochastic modelling and statistical analysis. While some of the areas will involve considerable use of computers, the main emphasis will not be on constructing simulation models but rather on formulating, fitting and understanding analytic (mathematical) models and learning how well they fit observed data and how they can generate understanding of the processes under study.

"The effects of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations on plant growth have been studied intensively. In spite of these efforts, there are still relatively few generalizations we can make concerning these effects. Elevated CO2 generally increases growth, but the magnitude of this effect varies widely. In particular, the effect of elevated CO2 on plants grown as individuals differs dramatically from its effects when plants are grown in competition. Work from my laboratory has demonstrated that in addition to its effects on growth, CO2 also interacts with light to control development. We have shown that the effect of CO2 on germination, stem elongation, branching, and flowering can vary in magnitude and direction depending on light quality and photoperiod. These effects in turn, can have a dramatic effect on the growth response. An understanding of how and why atmospheric CO2 affects development will clearly be useful in explaining the confusing and often complex effects of CO2 on plant growth. To this end, the proposed research will examine two aspects of the effect of CO2 on development. First, we will use the developmental mutants of Arabidopsis to explore which developmental pathways are impacted by CO2. This will provide a framework for understanding and predicting the effects of CO2 on development under different environmental conditions. Second, we will examine the possibility that the contrasting effects of CO2 on growth of individually versus competitively grown plants are related to the changes in light quality associated with competition. We will grow species differing in shade tolerance and Arabidopsis mutants differing in their capacity to respond to light quality at ambient versus elevated CO2 as individuals and in competition. Results will be useful in helping us predict how rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations will affect plant populations and communities and will be of interest to foresters and agronomists, as well as to ecologists.

"This research studies how real fluids vital for human life (water, air, blood) behave under complex conditions. We are interested in understanding how air moves around wind turbines to improve its design and make it to produce more electricity. Our ability to understand how a contaminant spreads in a neighborhood will allow us to improve emergency evacuation plans. Finally, an understanding of how blood circulation affects coronary and heart diseases will lead to improved treatments and saved lives.

 

To deal with such complex problems, scientists use computer simulation. The few complex mathematical differential equations are transformed into large number simpler of algebraic equations (this is called discretization) that are then solved using a computer. After many hours of calculations on powerful machines, scientists analyze the results in a form of images and movie animations.



As the discretization of the mathematical equations is always a problem, we propose to use a simpler way for flow simulation, yet verifying the physics. It is based on imagining and calculating the collision of many tiny particles (a kind of micro billiard balls) inside a computer. We believe this method will produce better results than currently obtained by the discretization methods.



To sum up, this research will provide a simple computer-based way to study practical problems such as: blood flow in veins and arteries or the dispersion of hazardous elements in the atmosphere. This research offers great potential to have a significant impact on the quality of life of the Canadian population.

"Maternal dietary, environment and pathogen-induced stress during pregnancy are important factors contributing to animal growth during pregnancy, survival after birth and postnatal health. In particular, pathogen-induced bacterial infections result in significant losses to agriculture. Treatment of healthy pregnant animals with bacterial cell wall components, termed lipopolysaccharide (LPS) provides an important approach for modeling how infection adversely affects pregnancy outcomes. Exposure to LPS in fetal life, results in fetal growth restriction (low birth weight outcomes) and animal losses. Additionally, in postnatal animals, LPS exposure affects skeletal muscle development providing a basis for reduced protein development; however this mechanism has not yet been established to occur during fetal development.

Lysine is an essential amino acid required for fetal development and growth. Perturbations to the system of lysine supply from mother to fetus and into the fetuses' developing tissue beds, (e.g., muscle) likely adversely affect growth potential. During pregnancy, circulating levels of lysine are increased in animal fetal preparations associated with animal growth restriction. This suggests that there is an adaptive movement of lysine occurring out of fetal tissues under stressful conditions, thereby reducing muscle development. The promotion of this movement occurs possibly through the activation of a lysine amino acid transporter component under a LPS challenge. This activation sets the scene for reduced protein development, as a result of substrate loss, together with stress induced protein building machinery inactivation in fetal life. This presents a significant problem for sustained muscle growth and development in postnatal life.

Our work is aimed at understanding how infections alter fetal muscle amino acid transport. The outcomes will define the molecular mechanisms regulating fetal amino acid and protein dynamics following LPS treatment and thus probe the basic mechanisms underlying fetal loss and or future reduced growth potential following infection during pregnancy, which is a significant economical problem facing livestock production facilities.

"The genetic information held in DNA molecules is copied each time a cell divides.  Highy efficient enzymes called DNA polymerases carry out this important copying (replication) process.  Thus, DNA polymerases are essential for cell survival.  We have used genetic methods to identify mutant DNA polymerases that have altered DNA polymerase functions.  For example, some of the mutant DNA polymerases make many mistakes when they copy DNA; these are called ""mutator"" DNA polymerases.  Mutator DNA polymerases teach us about mechanisms used by DNA polymerases to prevent replication errors. Other mutant DNA polymerase are sensitive to drugs, for example phosphonoacetic acid.  The use of genetics has allowed us to identify DNA polymerase functions that are not apparent from studying wild type DNA polymerases.  One application of our studies is to use the information about DNA polymerase function to ""engineer"" DNA polymerases that can be used for DNA sequencing.  While current DNA sequencing methods have produced sequence information for several organisms including humans, it is necessary to develop cheaper and faster methods before sequence information can be readily obtained for individuals.  The goal is the $1000 genome.  New methods are in development to reach this goal.  Since many of the novel new methods use DNA polymerases, we are using our expertise in DNA polymerase function to ""tailor"" make DNA polymerases for these applications.

"In an economy where more and more companies have international activities, logistics plays a crucial role.  Within the logistics field, transportation and network design issues are at the heart of some of the more important problems that must be solved to ensure competitiveness.  Since these issues are to be addressed considering a planning environment where uncertainty is always present, the research program that is part of this proposal is dedicated to the development of optimization models and solution algorithms for stochastic problems related to this field.  Three main research areas will be covered here.  Research area one will consider stochastic vehicle routing problems as they are defined when complex operational issues are to be taken into account (e.g., ""rich"" planning environment).  Research area two will cover the design of the supply chain when uncertainty influences the parameters to be considered.  Within these first two research areas, practical and applied problems will be studied; therefore, three major tasks will be undertaken.  The first will be dedicated to the modelling of the problems considered.  A particular emphasis will be placed on formulating the uncertainty observed and on expressing the real recourse actions available to companies that face these issues.  The second task will include the development of solution algorithms for the problems formulated.  Finally, the third task will cover the validation of the solutions obtained.  Within this task, simulation based models will be used to measure the effectiveness of the stochastic approach that is proposed.  The third and last research area defined in this proposal will be used for the development of general solution methodologies for classical stochastic problems.  Within this area, the use of both hybrid and parallel strategies will be considered.

"As transistors approach atomic-scale size limits, what will become of Moore's Law?  A possible answer is that quantum computers, which take advantage of quantum effects at small scales, will take the baton and give further exponential increases in computational power.  This proposal will address two important questions: 

1. What are quantum computers good for?  The best-known quantum algorithms are for factoring and simulating quantum systems.  Although many other algorithms are known, the full power of quantum computers is still mysterious.  We have developed a new framework for designing quantum algorithms based on a classical computational model known as ""span programs.""  So far, we have found optimal algorithms for a large class of formula-evaluation problems.  For example, the question of whether white or black has a winning strategy in chess is a special case of evaluating an AND-OR formula, a common problem whose quantum complexity our work has now characterized.  A main research direction is to apply the framework to other problems for which optimal quantum algorithms are not yet known, e.g., many graph problems.  

2. How can we build a quantum computer?  Quantum computers have not yet been implemented.  The major difficulty, common to all the different approaches, is overcoming noise in fragile quantum systems.  Improved physical engineering can only eliminate some noise.  Efficient fault-tolerance schemes, for computing reliably with noisy operations, are essential.  I have worked on designing such schemes, and further progress is likely to come from tailoring the schemes more closely to the strengths and weaknesses of particular experimental systems.  Beyond developing new fault-tolerance schemes, though, technical work is also required to develop methods to evaluate accurately proposed schemes; the schemes cannot be tested on quantum computers today, nor can they be easily simulated on classical computers.  

If successful, then the proposed research should simplify experimental implementations of quantum computers by loosening noise requirements, and should broaden their applicability.

"Solving polynomial equations is one of the oldest problems in mathematics. The natural approach to this problem is to look for a sequence of substitutions (otherwise known as Tschirnhaus transformations) that simplifies this equation to a form that can be easily solved. The antient Babylonians knew how to do this for quadratic equations as early as 1600 BC. A similar approach led to the  solution of cubic and quartic equations during the Renaissance. In the early 19th century Abel and Galois showed that a general polynomial equation of degree higher than four cannot be solved in radicals. One can nevertheless ask how far one can simplify this equation by Tschirnhaus transformations. Ten years ago, thinking about this question has led me and my collaborators to the notion of essential dimension, a concept that proved to be fruitful both within and far beyond the theory of polynomials. One of the goals of this proposal is to continue this research in two exciting new directions, one in the traditional setting of algebraic groups, theother in the new setting of algebraic stacks.



Another part of this proposal was inspired by a question of Herbert Hauptman, a 1985 Nobel laureate in chemistry. To determine the structure of a physical crystal, one needs to know certain quantities, called ``phases"". In practice, these cannot be measured directly; however, one can measure another set of quantities called ``observables"".  The question then becomes: if the ``observables"" are known, can one recover the ``phases"", and if so, what is the most efficient way to carry out the computations? Joe Buhler and I showed that the ``phases"" can always be recovered from the ``observables"". The problem of finding efficient algorithms to carry out the computations naturally leads to interesting theoretical questions in computational algebra, having to do with SAGBI bases. The goal of this part of the proposal is to investigate the existence problem for SAGBI bases as well as alternative algorithms in those cases where a SAGBI bases does not exist.

"My long-term interests are: (i) What are the mechanisms by which plants sense & respond to environmental stress/change. (ii) What is the role of hormones & other signal molecules as messengers & amplifiers of a fluctuating environment? (iii) How do shoots communicate with roots & roots communicate with shoots? Environmental change/stress triggers the production of multiple signals & these acting in concert modify growth & development in ways that increase survival. Roots & shoots are trapped in dissimilar environments, yet both organs must act cooperatively. Above- & below-ground organs need to efficiently exchange information about conditions being experienced by the other distant organ. What processes do these messages trigger when they reach the target organ? What is the identity of messages passing between organs in response to sensing of environmental alteration? How are such messages coordinated? How do the networks of interacting messages function? In this proposal I will focus on the question, what happens in roots when they receive messages/signals from environmentally perturbed shoots? Roots make up approximately 50% of the world's terrestrial plant biomass yet there is surprisingly little research on roots compared to aboveground tissues. Being buried in the soil presents technical challenges. While investigation of roots is fraught with difficulties, we have developed techniques that allow us to effectively probe the physiology & biochemistry of this inadequately understood organ. The hypothesis being tested is: Shoots, subjected to range of environmental perturbations (different red/far red irradiation, UV-B, wind stress, high CO2) will send signals to roots triggering them to quickly modify their metabolism & growth & development. Some of the parameters to be measured are: changes in levels of root hormones (concentrating on ethylene in the first instance), metabolic fingerprinting & footprinting of roots & root exudates, & monitoring of root architecture & morphology with MacRhizo software.

"Symbolic Computation is the study of algorithms and software systems to manipulate mathematical expressions. Until recently the algorithms have processed exact expressions and equations only.  Driven by the needs of applications, in which data is approximate, the subject has grown to include symbolic-numeric computation for polynomial equations.  This is part of a broad effort to combine the generality of exact symbolic computation with the realism and efficiency of numeric computation.

       Building on my previous results my proposal extends this subject further to efficient symbolic-numeric algorithms for approximate differential polynomial systems.  Such systems express fundamental laws of science and applications have yielded ever more complicated systems involving, for example 100's of differential equations for the currents in complex circuits and the motions of components of medical robots.  To analyze and solve such complicated models, computers are required at every stage: from formulation to solution.

       Differentiation of such systems can reveal hidden constraints which are crucial in their geometric and solution properties. The proposal is to create and analyze new algorithms for such systems which enable: the stable and efficient symbolic-numeric algorithmic determination of their constraints; and the computer exploitation of the resulting geometry in the analysis and solution process.  Algorithms will also be developed for exploiting the structure of systems typically arising in applications.  This builds on powerful results in differential geometry and differential algebra, combined with the new area Numerical Algebraic Geometry, that gives a numerically stable approach for the first time to the simpler subclass of approximate polynomial equations.  Existing symbolic techniques can detect global constraint structure but are limited to exact systems; while existing numeric techniques for more realistic approximate systems detect local, but not global structure.  The research focuses on symbolic-numeric algorithms for structured systems, including global structure.

"When searching for habitat, individuals in better condition should be more likely to find better habitat than those in poorer condition.  This observation is supported by my previous NSERC-sponsored research on bark beetles (Scolytinae).  It may then follow that offspring of individuals in good condition will also be in good condition and also find good habitat.  This has been called the silver spoon effect, and may influence reproductive strategies, fitness, and micro-evolution within populations.  There may also be direct maternal effects that are independent of habitat effects.  My research program will examine the relative importance of silver spoon and maternal effects in two species of bark beetles through lab and field studies.  The results of this research has implications for optimal offspring sex ratios, and may explain a perplexing female-bias in mountain pine beetles, Dendroctonus ponderosae, that has implications for many taxa.  In addition to addressing fundamental questions of optimal reproductive tactics, this research is pertinent to understanding and managing pest species of bark beetles such as mountain pine beetles.","Advancement of knowledge","University of Calgary",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Sociobiologie et �cologie �thologique","�volution et �cologie"
"Terahertz frequency radiation (which occurs at the infrared/microwave boundary) is a relatively unexploited portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, primarily as a consequence of underdeveloped technology.  The generation and detection of pulsed terahertz radiation is now suitable for exploitation by industry, and is paving the way for exciting new research.   The present proposal describes a multifaceted research program to study the generation, detection and applications of terahertz radiation that spans fundamental science through to industrially relevant research.  

    )	There are three components to this program: (i) a collaborative effort for the generation of very-high-power terahertz pulses at the Advanced Laser Light Source (ALLS), and subsequent use in studies of the interaction of high-intensity terahertz radiation with matter, (ii) modeling of these interactions as well as terahertz generation processes, and (iii) examination of potential industrial uses of terahertz technology .

    )	The development of terahertz radiation at ALLS is underway, and expected to produce world-record levels of pulsed terahertz radiation in the very near future, allowing for fundamental studies not previously possible.  

    )	Modeling of the terahertz emission processes will play a key role in the optimization of sources being developed at ALLS.  This will help to drive innovations in emitter design, allowing for even higher power terahertz pulses, which will help keep Canada internationally competitive in this highly active field of research.  Modeling is also important to direct future experiments.

    )	Wood is opaque at infrared, optical and UV wavelengths.  The most successful imaging of wood and wood products has been done at X-ray frequencies, but X-rays are a health hazard which limits their application.  Wood is transparent in the terahertz-frequency range (sub-mm wavelength radiation) allowing transmission imaging of features this size and larger.  This research program aims to develop technology to benefit the Canadian wood products industry, which is economically important to this country.

"Modern technology has enabled the collection of large and complex sets of data, and these are being used to answer important research questions in many fields of science and social science.  Statistical methods are used to understand both the structure and the noise in this data, and new methods are being rapidly developed by statisticians working in collaboration with biologists, physicists, epidemiologists, social scientists and many others.  These new methods typically involve quite complex modeling, and are computationally intensive in their implementation.  In many cases these new methods are defined algorithmically in each context.    The theory of statistical inference provides us with a set of guidelines for tackling new problems, provides a framework for assessing approaches developed in particular contexts, and searches for the common structure in what may seem to be very diverse problems.  Statistical theory has been very successful in finding basic structure and suggesting new solutions, and as the field develops more and more sophisticated approaches to data there is an accompanying need for understanding the basis for the analysis.



The research proposed here is to develop the theory of inference to very complex settings by investigating statistical methods in detail, both mathematically and in practical application.   The mathematical analysis  provides insight into the process of inference from data, suggesting what information is available and how this information may be extracted.  The statistical interpretation of the mathematics can suggest new ways for scientists to analyze their data.

"This research examines some of the mechanisms involved in controlling breathing in anuran amphibians (frogs and toads). Unlike humans and other mammals, amphibians do not breathe continuously. Rather they display a discontinuous pattern of breathing called periodic breathing. This type of breathing can take the form of irregular single breaths, the occasional occurrence of pairs of breaths or the grouping of breaths (usually 4-8) into discrete episodes separated by periods of no breathing called apneas (which can be several minutes in length). While periodic breathing is normal in amphibians, it is abnormal and pathological in humans. Humans can display this pattern of breathing during sleep either due to an obstruction of the airway (obstructive sleep apnoea) or due to abnormalities in the areas of the brain that regulate continuous breathing (central sleep apnoea). Either form of sleep apnoea in humans is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease such as heart attack or stroke. Furthermore, apnoea is associated with a reduction in oxygen levels in the blood and an increase in carbon dioxide levels in the blood due to the absence of continuous breathing. In general, a reduction in oxygen levels is called hypoxia while an increase in carbon dioxide levels is called hypercapnia.

    )	The research in this proposal will address two main questions: 1) First, what are the mechanisms within the amphibian brain that lead to the production of periodic breathing? 2) Second, how does exposure to long-term hypoxia and hypercapnia (induced experimentally) alter the systems within the brain that control breathing. To examine how the amphibian brain controls breathing, we experimentally manipulate neurochemical systems in various regions of the brain (by injecting various drugs) and observe how breathing changes. We do this on animals kept in room air and animals exposed to long-term hypoxia and hypercapnia. The results will increase our understanding of how breathing is controlled by the brain with possible application to understanding abnormalities in human breathing.

"Arsenic is well known as a poison and a cancer-causing agent. We propose to study how the chemical form of arsenic changes in the environment, and how these changes influence the potential for harmful effects to humans or animals when they are exposed to arsenic. We will do this by first measuring the arsenic chemical forms present in samples that humans or animals may be exposed to. We will also determine the reasons for the arsenic changes with a focus on whether they occur as detoxification responses. We will use two tools that we have expertise in: synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy, complemented by conventional testing methods, to characterize the distribution of arsenic, and a testing method called bioaccessibility. Bioaccessibility testing allows us to mimic the gastro-intestinal environment of humans or animals in a laboratory environment and gives us the amount of arsenic that is soluble in the stomach and intestines. The first step we will undertake will be to develop conventional testing methods that can identify arsenic-sulfur species, allowing us to quantify these species in samples whose arsenic concentrations are too low to study by XAS. Our second step will be to determine the chemical forms of arsenic in birds, mammals and insects, by combined conventional (including the methods developed for arsenic-sulfur analysis) and XAS methods. The third step is to measure the arsenic chemical forms that are soluble in the gastro-intestinal environment (bioaccessible) in some of these samples, which will help us to determine if humans or animals are at risk of harmful effects from arsenic exposure.

"Polysaccharides are important biological molecules.  They are found throughout nature and play various roles in the biology of plants and animals.  The earliest known roles of polysaccharides where found to be related to structure or energy storage. Cellulose and chitin are structural polysaccharides of plants, and various shellfish and insects, respectively; whereas, plant starch and animal glycogen serve as energy storage molecules. 

     Over the past two decades additional roles of more complex polysaccharides have been discovered.   They are now known to mediate many important biological interactions such as the immune response, inflammation, and cell-cell recognition of various types.  Most of this information has been gathered based on studies of mammalian or bacterial systems.  The role polysaccharides play in plant systems is less well understood, although it is becoming apparent that plant polysaccharides have more complex roles as well.

     This research proposal outlines the chemical synthesis of small segments of plant polysaccharides, called oligosaccharides.  The synthetic oligosaccharides will be used to i) identify the fine binding specificity of some existing monoclonal antibodies and ii) generate monoclonal antibodies with well defined binding properties.  These monoclonal antibodies will then be used by plant physiologists to study the biological roles of plant cell wall polysaccharides, leading to a better understanding of plant biology.

"There is convincing evidence that nutritional influences early in life can permanently program adult health. A range of animal studies have shown that maternal under-nutrition during pregnancy can be harmful to the offspring once they reach adulthood. Disturbances in body weight, blood glucose control and lipid (fat) metabolism often present to a greater extent in offspring of undernourished versus well-nourished female rats. Much less is known, however, about maternal over-nutrition and the lasting effects it has on offspring. Over-nutrition of certain dietary components has the potential to be either protective or detrimental. The two dietary treatments we wish to examine in this grant are high fiber and high protein. Our goal, therefore, is to determine the effect of maternal diet on developmental programming of lipid and glucose metabolism in offspring. We hypothesize or predict that maternal diets high in dietary fiber will program protective effects and those high in protein will program detrimental effects in offspring. The specific objectives we will address in this grant are: 1) Determine the long-term effects of a maternal diet high in fiber or protein on lipid and glucose metabolism in offspring once they reach adulthood. 2) Determine the effect of maternal diet high in dietary fiber or protein on gut bacterial profiles of mothers and offspring. Certain bacteria in the gut can increase energy harvest from food and increase body fat. 3) Determine the effect of an imbalance between prenatal and postnatal nutritional environment. Mismatched environments may be more harmful. 4) Determine whether a postnatal diet high in dietary fiber can reverse the negative developmental programming associated with compromised prenatal nutrition. The overall goal of this proposal is to undertake basic research on how dietary patterns during fetal development affect glucose and lipid metabolism. The results of this work will provide important insight into the factors involved in the developmental origins of health and disease. The impact of high intakes of dietary fiber and protein, a relatively untouched area of research in the developmental literature, is likely to greatly expand our knowledge of how nutrition programs the health of the fetus for life.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","University of Calgary",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Nutrition,"Sciences de la vie li�es � la sant� publique et aux maladies humaines"

"Elastic fibers provide elasticity to tissues of most higher vertebrates that undergo repeated stretch, such as large arteries, lung, elastic ligaments and skin. Elastic fiber formation in biological tissues is a highly organized mechanism, requiring numerous proteins and protein interactions. Among the important proteins in this process is a subset of the fibulin family of extracellular proteins. Fibulin-4 and -5, and to a lesser extent fibulin-3, have been shown to be critical for elastic fiber formation. The structural and functional basis for this role, however, is largely unknown. We will employ a combined biophysical, biochemical and cell biological approach using state of the art methodologies to determine structural features of these fibulins and their characteristics in calcium binding. We further aim to map interaction sites with known binding ligands and to identify novel unknown binding ligands, which may be important for elastic fiber formation. Functional contributions of interaction sites will be identified in cell culture approaches. It is expected that information gained from this project will not only enhance our basic understanding of elastic fiber formation, but will also help to generate new possibilities in obtaining synthetic advanced bio- and nanomaterials.

"The Makran subduction zone (MSZ) is the second largest subduction zone in the world which conveys the Arabian plate beneath the Eurasian plate and has a poorly understood potential to generate tsunamis that would strike Oman, Iran, Pakistan, and India.  The 1945 Makran earthquake (M 8.1), which resulted from a rupture 100-150 km long, caused a tsunami that reached heights of 5-15 m and killed an estimated 3,000 people on the coast of what is now Pakistan.  The possibility of a full-length Makran rupture, approx. 750 km long, remains untested and there is a serious lack of seismic and tsunami records to assess hazards.

   The Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System (IOTWS), coordinated by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, includes a working group on risk assessment that has specifically called for paleotsunami work on the Makran subduction zone.  In order to test tsunami propagation models and develop a better sense of the periodicity and magnitudes of the events, paleo-tsunami research is critical to ground-truth the results and assess the risk.  As demonstrated at the Cascadia subduction zone in North America, tsunami geology can help identify tsunami hazards that, like the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, would otherwise seem without precedent.  The IOTWS risk-assessment working group endorsed Makran paleotsunami research in hopes of discoveries that help avert surprises.

   The proposed research will satisfy part of this UNESCO initiative by studying and developing paleotsunami indicators on the coast of Oman.  The research will use coastal geology to document deposits from the 1945 event and will interview survivors to corroborate the results.  Records from sediment cores will document older tsunamis and begin developing a catalogue of events for the MSZ.  We hope to estimate reoccurrence intervals and importantly determine whether the western segment of the MSZ has produced tsunamis in the past.  The proposed research will provide important knowledge transfer to Arabian Sea countries where little paleotsunami expertise exists.

"Magnetic Resonance (MR) as used for in-vivo imaging is an established tool in the study of biological systems.  More recently, the tissue functional status can be interrogated using advanced MR techniques.  The major challenge in imaging tissue function is to understand the complex interplay between cellular physiology and MR parameters.  MR physics provides an opportunity to meet this challenge by devising new imaging techniques and better models to extract physiologically relevant parameters.

 A central question in understanding tissue function relates to vasculature -- the blood supply of tissue.  Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging studies the in-vivo distribution of contrast agents and thus gives access to parameters characterising vasculature.  One parameter with important implications for studies of vasculature-changing diseases and drugs is vessel permeability. Unfortunately, permeability is not directly accessible using current MR acquisition techniques and using existing models due to confounding factors like blood flow.  We will develop a technique that relies on two agents that differ greatly in their propensity to leak from blood vessels.  This dual-tracer MR technique will give access to vessel permeability.

 Also of great interest, water diffusion imaging provides information about cellular structure on a micrometer scale.  Our preliminary findings of transient decreases of diffusion coefficients in treated tumours are not explained by the current understanding of the dynamics of tissue diffusion during necrosis.  We will further investigate the temporal change of diffusion coefficients, probe the universality of our observation using different tumour models and drugs, and correlate our finding to immunohistochemical, whole-tissue sections.  We will compare tissue perfusion derived from diffusion-weighted images with perfusion from dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging.

 The validation crucial for both imaging methods will be performed using correlation of MR-derived and histology-derived parameters. We have developed reliable methods of correlating MR parameters to histology.

"Nanofluidic devices are networks of fluid-filled channels etched on a chip with dimensions on order of 1-100nm.  Devices with such small dimensions can have radically different properties than their macro world analogs, in particular the ability to manipulate and analyze single molecules.

The PI's research program is devoted to the basic science and applications of nanofluidics. The basic science component of the PI's research is devoted to increasing fundamental understanding of how single macromolecules behave in nanoconfined environments and using this understanding to develop new device concepts.  The applied component is devoted to using nanofluidic technology to tackle immediate problems in biomedicine.  When DNA is squeezed into a small 'nanopipe' (e.g. using high pressure) the molecule will stretch out, unscrolling the genome along the channel.  The PI has developed a new 'melting mapping' approach to analyze the unscrolled DNA.  If successful, the nanochannel based melting mapping technology may lead to new methods for characterizing variations in our genome (that can increase our susceptibility to disease), map highly repetitive 'difficult to sequence' regions of the genome and help understand the onset of cancer at the level of single cells.

The requested fluorescence microscopy setup, to be placed in the PI's laboratory in the Rutherford Bld. at McGill University, will serve as (1) a versatile platform for the operation of nanofluidic devices for single molecule manipulation and control and (2) a setup for training students and other HQP in nanofluidic device operation and single molecule fluorescence microscopy techniques. Nanofluidic devices will be fabricated in clean rooms in the Montreal area and then brought to the laboratory, where they will be run with the fluorescence microscopy setup.  The requested setup consists of an inverted microscope with filter sets and optics, a sensitive electron-multiplying CCD camera (for single molecule imaging), an automated micropositioning stage and an epi-fluorescence illumination system.

"Researchers at the University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM) campus require a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for high magnification, high resolution imaging. The campus does not have one and its research facilities are independent from those at its Toronto campus (about 30 km distant) so it is not practical to use SEMs there for our research. We are seeking to purchase a table top scanning electron microscope (SEM) that is convenient, simple and low-cost to operate. The proposed unit permits up to 20,000 times magnification and measurements in nanometers, but also allows for large depth of focus imaging for biologists, paleontologists, and archaeologists at UTM. Standard SEMs require a special installation with technician support. However, the proposed table top SEM requires a very short learning curve and does not require a technician, is remarkably easy to use and maintain. Thus, individual researchers can use the instrument as the need arises. The SEM is controlled by software on a linked computer and images may be captured at a variety of resolutions. The tabletop SEM is particularly well suited for the examination of fossils, plant tissue, insects, animal cells, and industrial products for which elemental analysis is not required. We currently have facilities for the study of these materials at the photographic, macroscopic, and microscopic levels, but not at the magnification provided by the proposed SEM. Thus, the proposed instrument fills a much needed gap in our range of image analysis, and is ideally suited for multidisciplinary use. In addition, the proposed instrument will serve as an excellent research bridge between various disciplines with shared interests in studying ultrastructure at high magnification.

"My research has focused on the evolution of terrestrial vertebrates, with special emphasis on the biology and evolution of amniotes.  Amniota includes all living reptiles, birds, mammals, as well as their fossil relatives. Early amniotes evolved in the equatorial Laurasia during the formation of the superconinent Pangea, when a great ice age extended from the Carboniferous into the Early Permian. These early amniotes are the first chapter in the 315 million year long evolutionary history of vertebrates on land, and phylogenetic analyses indicate that they are at the base of all major groups of amniotes (living reptiles, birds, and mammals). 

My proposal focuses on the study of Paleozoic terrestrial vertebrates, their anatomy, phylogenetic relationships, taphonomy, within a temporal framework. This approach allows me to take advantage of the strengths of this field and permits me to reconstruct the patterns of their initial diversifications and geographic dispersals in great detail. These patterns are therefore of great interest to me, and I plan to study them by combining our increasing knowledge of vertebrate history with their known occurrences. In collaboration with current and past graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, I plan to construct a detailed, specimen based database of all Paleozoic terrestrial tetrapods so that we can develop a detailed model of the initial stages of terrestrial vertebrate evolution. My ongoing research program also includes studies on the origin and early history of herbivory and the associated changes that occurred in the terrestrial vertebrate trophic structure. The combination of well established paleontological approaches with new database constructions and analyses is guaranteed to expand dramatically our understanding of the biology and evolutionary history of early amniotes and their terrestrial vertebrate relatives.

"In the last two decades, auctions have received a lot of attention in economics, operations research and computer science literature. All reported studies in auctions design field recognized the potential benefits of the, so-called, combinatorial auctions, especially when complementarities exist between the traded items. Combinatorial auctions refer to auction mechanisms in which bids on combinations of items are permitted. A significant effort has been devoted since the mid-1990's to the elaboration of advanced ''package bidding'' auction techniques. The majority of this research considers however unilateral markets, i.e., markets including either, one seller and multiple buyers or one buyer and multiple sellers. This research program addresses the problem of designing and implementing combinatorial auctions in multilateral markets where multiple sellers and buyers trade heterogeneous items. The objective is to provide the actors of the market with optimized decision tools to help them solve some of the problems they would face during or after the auction process. The emphasis will be put on three inter-related decision problems: (1) Who are the final winners? (2) What should every participant pay or receive at the end of the auction? (3) What is the best strategy for constructing bids? The originality of the proposed approaches consists in combining mathematical modeling and optimization techniques, proper to the operations research field, and cost sharing and pricing methods, used in cooperative game theroy. Such a combination is relevant in a multilateral context where combinatorial bids are permitted. All the proposed approaches will be evaluated through generated and real-life problem tests arising in various contexts such as transportation service procurement or electricity markets. They will thus contribute to both industrial and academic environements.

"My work is centred on deriving algorithmic solutions that enhance an agent's autonomy through intelligent decision-making, collaboration and information exchange with the other members of the computational group. The agents may be nodes in a sensor network, mobile robots, or robotic spacecraft. Autonomy capabilities are especially important when robots operate in challenging environments such as underwater or in space. In particular both planetary exploration and underwater robotics suffer from the same limitations as communication with a human operator is intermittent and with low bandwidth. In order to facilitate autonomy any robotic system must address the following fundamental problems: estimate their state with respect to the surrounding environment; model the world around them; and plan their tasks in an optimal manner. In the proposed research I am planning to extend my work on state estimation for robots moving in three dimensions, using a variety of techniques such as Particle filters and Extended Kalman Filters. I am also planning to develop new techniques for environment modelling using irregular triangular meshes. The previous two components are usually termed together as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in the robotics community. Moreover, it has been demonstrated in my earlier work, as well as, by other researchers that collaboration between intelligent agents greatly enhances their capabilities.  Therefore in my future plans is the extension of single robot planetary exploration algorithms to multiple robots. 



In general, my research reflects the belief that, as robotic systems become more common, the need for autonomy is very important, and collaboration among them becomes necessary. Collaborative agents are able to better understand their environment and perform complex actions robustly and efficiently. Many open problems remain in the field of multi-agent/multi-robot systems, and I am looking forward to solving them.

"In most applications of statistics, in particular in financial engineering, dynamical stochastic models are assumed to satisfy certain hypotheses, mainly related to their probabilistic distribution. For example, in time series, random error terms (innovations) are often assumed to be independent and/or have a distribution belonging to some family of distributions. The general objective of the proposed research program is to further study empirical processes based on pseudo observations, which are transformations of data from the same sample, and use them to develop tests of lack-of-fit for models appearing mainly in actuarial science, econometry, financial engineering and statistics. Another project consists in studying dynamical allocation methods of assets in finance, with applications to pricing of derivatives and the replication of hedge funds.

"The boreal forest forms a wide circum-polar swath covering extensive regions of Canada, Scandinavia, and Siberia.  This biome provides natural functioning to regulate numerous atmospheric and hydrologic processes while providing habitat for many species of flora and fauna.  Susceptible to extensive natural disturbances (e.g. fire, insects, wind), these northern forests are effectively described as forming a heterogeneous dynamic landscape mosaic.  Additionally, the vast boreal forest represents a renewable natural resource that results in extensive harvesting operations for extracting timber and wood fiber; thus further altering the mosaic through anthropogenic influences.



Current forest management policies stress the requirement of emulating natural disturbances while planning forest-harvesting operations.  Such legislated policies assume that the boreal environment is somehow able to better recover from, or unaffectedly develop following natural disturbances.  Thus, any anthropogenic alterations of the landscape should mimic these acceptable natural disturbances.  The problem remains that science currently cannot unequivocally explain the ecological differences among disturbance regimes nor can they scientifically claim that natural disturbances are better for the environment than are disturbances with anthropogenic origins.  This research has the goal to discover linkages among specific spatial patterns and ecological processes and to elucidate any differences among forest disturbance types.  If a spatial pattern can be contextualized as a realization of a spatial process at an instant in time, then that pattern should contain some insight to the process(es) that developed it.  It is the analysis and comparison of spatial patterns created by forest disturbances and the re-vegetation process that I wish to explore within a multidimensional spatial and temporal framework.  Research will integrate data from fieldwork, satellite imaging, and spatial statistical analysis.

"The project will develop an adaptive controlled mandibular protruder (ACMP). The ACMP is a medical device that will be used for the treatment of the 40+ million people who suffer from obstructive sleep apnea and high upper airway resistance. ACMP is an oral appliance designed and developed by Dr. John Remmers who is widely recognized as the founder of modern sleep apnea treatment (CPAP). Dr. Remmers ongoing work in this field has highlighted a need for new devices and management process that address low compliance issues associated with primary treatment options like CPAP. While oral appliances are not a new concept in the management of obstructive sleep apnea, current appliances, are known to cause dental and mandibular joint problems as a result of the forces needed to maintain the mandible in a fixed position throughout the night. The ACMP will respond to a number of measured physiologic parameters, continually optimizing the position of the mandible and minimizing the total forces applied to the mandible. The ACMP is expected to improve the therapeutic efficacy of dental devices, while minimizing side effects, such as tooth movement. The final development of the device will take advantage of technological advancements in miniaturization and physiologic monitoring, and produce an advanced prototype ready for regulatory testing at the end of the requested funding term.","Medical and health sciences","University of Calgary","1 & 2","I2IPJ ","Idea to Innovation","Sciences m�dicales","Sciences m�dicales"

"This equipment grant application is for the purchase of a GPC system from Malvern Instruments, Inc.. for analyzing molecular weight and its distributions for various polymers we are developing. This GPC has a number of unique features compared to other GPCs. It has four detectors to ensure accurate results and wide temperature operational range, which is especially useful when the solubility of a sample is not high in the eluting solvent. Furthermore, it has low angle light scattering which facilitates the extrapolation of molecular weight with a higher accuracy. 



The research to be supported by this requested equipment includes various ongoing research projects within the Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Waterloo. A few ongoing research programs are named here as examples: Development of Advanced Rubber Materials/Technology, Upgrading of Oilsands Bitumen, Development of Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology. These research programs are supported by NSERC/Industrial Research Chair projects,  NSERC Discovery Grant projects or industrial projects. These projects are at the frontier of the respective research fields. The realization of these projects will make significant contributions to both academic and commercial aspects of these research areas. An instrument, such as the requested GPC, for analyzing molecular weight is essential. 



The purchase of such equipment will enhance the research tools and training facilities in the Department of Chemical Engineering at University of Waterloo. The success of these research programs and the training of high quality personnel will be beneficial to high-tech development and economic prosperity of Canada.

"We have been developing microfluidic chip technology for chemical and biomedical assays. The major tools used for our development include numerical simulation for chip design and optimization, microfabrication using softlithography and conventional photolithography technology, and characterization using both UV- and fluorescence-based visualization techniques. Examples of recently developed microdevices include particle sorting and counting chips, cell culture chips, protein chips and microgrippers. The major applications target three areas which are: i) chemical detection for water and food safety control; ii) biomarker-based disease diagnosis and iii) cell-based analysis for drug discovery and delivery. The proposed research program will support the third direction: cell-based analysis for drug discovery, drug delivery and biomedical diagnosis. 



Cell-based analysis requires a large number of chemical and biological screenings. Microfluidic-based Lab-on-a-Chip technology has offered opportunities to accomplish this task with less time and low cost. Unfortunately, most microfluidic chips are difficult to scale up because the chip sizes will increase linearly with the number of assays to be parallelized on-chip. One promising approach is to employ a large number of droplets generated inside microchannels to perform individual biological or chemical reactions in a continuous manner which scales up the performance without increasing chip sizes. However, it does require fundamental understanding of the complex physics underlying droplet-based microfluidics so that droplets can be generated uniformly and controlled individually. This proposal aims to gain better understanding of the physics through numerical simulation and experimental tests. This research will be conducted in three parallel phases: Phase I: Numerical simulation of two-phase liquid-liquid flow in microfluidic channels; Phase II: Fabrication and surface patterning of microfluidic chips; and Phase III: Characterization of droplet-based microfluidic chips.

"This application proposes work with both theoretical and applied aspects. On the theoretical side, this proposal is related to two variants of risk models, which are described in the following. 



(1) Risk processes with discounted claims. In insurance practice, there usually is a time delay between the collection of the premiums and the payment of claims. In some lines of business, the delay could be as long as twenty years. Therefore, it is important to consider the time value of money in risk process by discounting the claims. Moments and related ruin problems for  classical risk processes with discounted claims has been studied extensively in the literature. However, there are not many theoretical results for  ruin problems in the Sparre-Andersen risk models with discounted claims. Therefore, this topic will form one of the primary research subjects of this proposal.



(2) Perturbed risk processes with barriers. Ruin probabilities for perturbed risk processes have been studied extensively in the risk theory literature. However, it seems that not much work has appeared relating to the perturbed risk model with barriers, where it is assumed that when the surplus exceeds the barrier, dividends are paid to the stakeholders. Therefore, in this project, I intend to study such properties of the risk processes under a barrier strategy.  Quantities of interests include the distribution and the moments of the discounted expected dividends and the expected penalty at ruin.



On the application side, this proposal describes a collaborative project entailing techniques in actuarial science and in engineering sciences to evaluate earthquake insurance.

"Risk management requires that an insurance company consider the possibility of experiencing adverse claims while satisfying its shareholders with, for instance, dividend payments. For a financial institution, accurate pricing of financial instruments is crucial for its own risk management. In both cases, an appropriate quantification of the risks necessitates the use of complex mathematical tools and models. The proposed research aims at analyzing such mathematical models.



An insurer must retain sufficient capital to meet its financial obligations while interacting with shareholders and tax authorities. That is, an event such as 'ruin' must be taken care of, in order to ensure that the insurer remains solvent, while dividend and tax payments have to be made. Our research aims at analyzing fairly general insurance risk processes where such features would be included. Outcomes from the first part of this research project will provide new and more powerful quantitative tools to insurers.



On the other hand, a financial institution should be able to price accurately the financial instruments that it buys and sells. While most theoretical models are built using the concept of 'continuity', the reality in practice is 'discrete' and thus, for the company to be able to implement the models using computers, discretization analysis must be pursued. The second part of this research focuses on the development of discretization techniques to simulate and analyze stock prices and interest rates. These are typically modelled with continuous dynamics and we are planning to provide approximating methods of these quantities. It is hoped that our tools will be included in the toolbox of practitioners.

"Muscle fatigue is defined as a decreased capacity of muscle to generate force or do work during repetitive stimulation. It is also a protective mechanism that prevents large ATP depletion and increase in cytosolic calcium, two factors known to cause contractile dysfunctions and fiber damage. One major mechanism of fatigue involves a decrease in calcium release resulting in less force generation.  This laboratory has extensively studied how changes in membrane excitability can result in less calcium release, and the main focus being on the Katp channel, sodium and potassium ions. We have provided evidence that the Katp channel is crucial in lowering membrane excitability to protect muscle against contractile dysfunctions and fiber damage. Although there is ample evidence for a contribution of sodium, potassium and hydrogen ions to the decrease in force during fatigue, new and exciting studies, from this laboratory and others, have also provided evidence that under some conditions theses same ions can enhance force or delay fatigue. 



We will test the overall hypothesis that ""membrane excitability during a non-fatiguing and fatiguing muscular activity is not solely dependent on changes in sodium, potassium and chloride concentration but also on how the ion effects are modulated by changes in the activity of various chloride and potassium channels. Four aims are proposed. The first two aims are a continuation of our present work on the Katp channel. Aim 1: to test whether the decrease in contractility following the activation of Katp channels is important in preventing contractile dysfunctions and fiber damage by lowering metabolic demand. Aim 2: to determine if contractile dysfunctions and fiber damage are also prevented by maintaining resting membrane potential to prevent large calcium influx. The other two aims are associated with an extension of our work to other ion channels. Aim 3: to document the role of the BK potassium channel in different fiber types. Aim 4: to establish the same for chloride channel.","Advancement of knowledge","University of Ottawa",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Physiologie et m�tabolisme des animaux","Biologie animale"

"My research focuses on structural and functional properties of human and animal communication. The goal is to identify similarities and differences between the two groups that will help to illuminate the trajectory of human language evolution, which remains one of the most difficult but important problems in contemporary science given the extensive and complex interconnections between language, thought, and behaviour. This proposal focuses on two core features of language, namely its indexical properties, which communicate many personal dimensions of speakers (e.g., their individual identity, sex, age, and body size) that are central to the daily social uses of language; and its representational properties, whereby words communicate additional symbolic information about the world around us. Animal vocal signals have similar indexical properties and, in some cases, can also function representationally a bit like words. Research will therefore pursue additional potential overlap in these properties of human and animal communication. Projects will include examining the priority of voice pitch (F0) versus resonances in indexical discriminations of vocalizer identity, sex, and body size in humans and baboons, as well as extended attributions of speaker attractiveness, authority, status and credibility in humans; the role of learned or evolved biases in such voice-based indexical judgements in humans; and the potential perceptual-cognitive links between evolutionarily ancient indexical dimensions cued by voice F0 and resonances in primates and simple representational contrasts marked by words in contemporary languages. Perceptual experiments will also test for potentially human-like lateralized brain processing of the indexical and representational content of species-specific vocalizations in baboons. Finally, new field studies of the behaviour and communication of red squirrels and wild turkeys will extend the framework of comparative research and provide broader tests of the roles that ecology, sociality, and brain size play in the evolution of representational complexity in animal and human communication.

"The applicant has extensive expertise using acoustic instrumentation to measure the flow field and sediment transport in rivers.  However, available instruments are not suited for medium-sized rivers. This is unfortunate, because medium-sized rivers are common, can offer excellent fluvial habitat, and are often subject to urban and rural river restoration efforts.  This proposal requests funds to purchase a small Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (miniADCP), which is designed for survey of medium sized rivers.  A miniADCP is deployed from a small platform that can be towed throughout a river reach.  Thus, full spatial surveys of medium sized rivers are possible.  Two field studies would immediately utilize this instrument: 1) the influence of submerged groynes on flow and sediment transport in a channel bend of a consolidated-clay bed river, and 2) an evaluation of typical channel width and depth for a given flow (i.e., 'hydraulic geometry') in consolidated clay-bed and other semi-alluvial river types.  Submerged groynes are rock structures that can be installed in series to protect an eroding river bank. These structures create vortices with both horizontal and vertical axes, which cause characteristic patterns of sediment scour and deposition. No previous studies have related the turbulent flow field to the bed morphology in a submerged groyne series. As a field case study, submerged groynes are to be installed in a medium-sized clay-bed river, and monitored with the miniADCP for three years for influence on the flow field and sediment transport dynamics. For the second study, the hydraulic geometry of semi-alluvial rivers will be evaluated. Due to the glacial history of Canada, many rivers in Canada are semi-alluvial because they are flowing over, and cutting into, glacial deposits or bedrock outcrops.  Thus, the river bed is not composed entirely of sediments that can be transported by the flow.  The mechanics of such rivers are poorly understood.  The miniADCP will be utilized to survey medium-sized semi-alluvial rivers, along with other instruments for small and large rivers, such that semi-alluvial hydraulic geometry relations can be developed.  These relations are sorely needed by practicing engineers and earth scientists for river restoration efforts.

"Sound management of rivers in Canada and worldwide is essential for many important purposes, including minimization of flood hazard, production of hydroelectricity, protection of in-stream and stream-bank infrastructure, and maintenance of healthy fisheries and aquatic ecosystems.  River management is challenging because rivers move sediment, and this transfer of sediment determines the shape of the river itself. River morphology can change due to natural and human influences, yet prediction of changes in channel form remains a challenging task. The proposed research program includes three projects designed to elucidate the relations between three-dimensional turbulent flow and sediment particle entrainment and transport in rivers, in order to understand and predict river morphology and habitat.  Research is to be conducted in the field, the laboratory, and numerically.  The first project describes sediment-flow processes throughout a large reach of the wandering gravel-bed Fraser River, British Columbia.  The second project examines the complex three-dimensional turbulent flow field and associated sediment transport through a series of submerged groynes in a channel bend.  Submerged groynes are used to protect eroding river banks while providing habitat for stream organisms.  The third project will be a study of semi-alluvial rivers, which in this case are rivers dominated by glacial deposits.  Such rivers are common in Canada, but poorly understood. In all three projects, high resolution spatially distributed measurements of the turbulent forcing flow and associated sediment transport will be utilized to construct improved morphodynamic models of river channel change. These models will serve as valuable tools for practicing engineers faced with managing and restoring the nation's rivers.",Environment,"University of Ottawa",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie hydraulique","G�nie civil"

"The proposed research involves theoretical investigations of various topics in abstract mathematics, and applications of mathematics to physics, biology, and chemical engineering.

    The concept of symmetry is of vital importance in physics, where proper understanding of symmetry can often make it possible to solve an otherwise impossible problem.  There are an array of mathematical tools for expressing symmetry, but one of the main ones is called Lie groups and Lie algebras.  Much of the technical work in this project involves developing and improving techniques for working with them.

    There are also a number of applications of mathematics.  In addition to uses of Lie groups and algebras to study questions in physics, there are elasticity analyses to investigate the viability of various species of threatened fish, especially the economically important West Coast salmon.  The hope is that this work will help to improve management and conservation strategies.

    The work includes several modelling projects.  In conjunction with collaborators in chemical engineering, there are projects which analyze the microbial community in wastewater treatment facilities and which analyze the phenomenon of ""ringing"" in lime kilns, with a view to developing strategies to reduce the incidence of this serious problem.

     There is a biology project devoted to analyzing the dramatically increased cormorant population in Ontario, which is probably a result of increased food supply in the winter range due to aquaculture in the Mississippi.  Another project involves building a model which we hope will explain the population genetics underlying the important but poorly understood phenomenon of hybridization.

"Quantum mechanics led to a revolution in science and technology that impacts our daily lives.  Devices, such as computer chips and lasers, are based firmly on quantum effects.  We are on the verge of a next wave of quantum technology, where exotic effects such as entanglement, uncertainty, and interference are harnessed to make blazingly fast computers and absolutely secure codes.  



Until recently, quantum computing was pictured as a sequence of logic gates acting on particles to carry out a quantum program.  Robert Raussendorf and Hans Briegel proposed a radically different approach; if one started with a many-particle entangled ""cluster"" state, quantum computation could proceed by simply making measurements on its constituent particles.  Each measurement eats away at the entanglement of the cluster and at the same time performs a quantum calculation.  This is ""one-way"" quantum computing.  Remarkably, this approach has been found to be the most efficient route to quantum computation using linear optics.  The size of the calculation allowed in the one-way model is limited by the number of particles in the cluster and it is very difficult to make larger entangled states.  This NSERC Discovery proposal is requesting funding for experimental implementations of new strategies for performing larger one-way quantum computations without requiring more particles.  We will focus on adapting the one-way model to use more general kinds of quantum measurements and study the one-way model with more complex cluster states.



This project will provide high-quality research training to two graduate students, one post-doctoral researcher, and several undergraduate students.  These people will gain hands-on experience with lasers, electronics, and computer programming, and a strong theoretical grounding in the exciting field of quantum computation.

"The major theme of my research is NMR studies of the dynamic and structural properties of small molecules and polymers at surfaces and interfaces. Main projects include 1) organic monolayers  2) polyelectrolyte multilayers and 3) nanoparticle/ liquid crystal composites. A large range of surface and colloidal characterization techniques are used in conjunction with solids NMR  such as surface infrared spectroscopy, light scattering,  optical microscopy, calorimetry and electrophoresis. Previous work on organic monolayers established the surface bonding  and chain dynamics of simple alkane monolayers. The next stage will focus on the binding of other molecules and macromolecules to these monolayers. Polyelectrolytes are highly charged polymers. The basic structural and dynamic properties of polyelectrolyte multilayers consisting of stong/strong and strong/weak polyanion/polycation combinations deposited on colloidal substrates have been explored by solids NMR. We will now move onto multilayers based on hydrogen bonding, deposited on nanoparticles and as hollow capsules. One goal is to understand the response of the capsules (shrinking versus swelling) to temperature, pH or salt which is relevant to their use as drug delivery agents. Our initial work on liquid crystals has focused on the ""memory effect"" of nanoparticle silica filled liquid crystals which have applications in display devices. These materials are initially opaque but become optically transparent in an electric field. This state persists after the field is turned off due to the formation of an ordered silica network. How such networks form is poorly understood. Wideline deuterium NMR is an excellent method for analyzing such structures. We will also study liquid crystal/ metal nanoparticle composites. The goal will be to create an ordered array so that the optical properties can be tuned by an applied field. Solids NMR will again provide a sensitive probe of the  the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules at the particle surfaces.

"As mononuclear phagocytes, tissue macrophages (M�) exhibit diverse and divergent activities in response to tissue damage. These functions are expected to be executed by at least two different subtypes of polarized M�: pro-inflammatory M1 M�, which express tissue-destructive activities, and anti-inflammatory M2 M�, which exhibit tissue-reparative activities. However, although the initial M� maturation process is well established, the regulating mechanisms involved in terminal M� differentiation remain to be clearly elucidated. To address this question, we have chosen uterine M� as experimental model because they are abundant within the endometrium and their number and phenotype are subjected to change in response to uterine or embryonic factors. During early pregnancy, uterine M� are locally modified to exhibit an immunosuppressive phenotype and to perform pregnancy-associated functions. Of note, some key pregnancy-associated factors are also involved in M� survival, activation and function. This suggests that uterine factors can also regulate stable M� polarization during early gestation via activation of specific signalling pathways in M�. The fundamental relevance of our studies is based on the fact that regulation of M� polarization is required for normal physiological processes, mainly the onset and the resolution of inflammation, but also to avoid inappropriate M� activation and thus lead to pathological functions. Using the mouse as a model, our long-term goal is to better understand and document the physiology of the uterine immune system by defining the molecular basis for physiological responses of resident and recruited leukocytes in the pregnant uterus. Specifically, we propose to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in M� differentiation during early pregnancy by investigating the effects of pregnancy-associated factors on M� polarization and plasticity in vivo and in vitro. It is hoped that the forthcoming information will generate new working hypothesis and concepts to better define the role of M�-mediated activities in other physiological or pathological processes.

"Why are some species of animals more vulnerable to extinction than others?  We are using marine and freshwater fish species as model systems to understand why some populations become extinct while others are highly resilient to human impacts.  A two-part research program has been designed to answer these questions.  First, large-scale comparisons will be made between a diverse array of fish species to understand how fundamental aspects of life cycles, such as age at maturity and rate of reproductive output, affect the ability of some fish species to be able to sustain fisheries, while others collapse.  This will be combined with comparisons of population responses to habitat loss in freshwater fishes and terrestrial animals, to improve the way in which we prioritize species for conservation.  The second part of the reserch program will use Pacific salmon as a model system for understanding how key populations that are important to fisheries affect other species.  Field studies in a remote coastal region of British Columbia will test for the importance of nutrients derived from salmon after the fish have spawned and died.  Natural variation among salmon streams in salmon densities will be related to uptake of salmon-derived nutrients in  plants, insects and vertebrates along streams and forests. A complementary large-sclae experiment will involve additions of carcasses to parts of streams, in order to study the short- and long-term impacts on various aspects of biodiversity.  This information will be used to help inform more holistic management that includes not only salmon, but also takes account of indirect impacts on the wider environment.

"Insect agricultural pests and insect vectored diseases have become resurgent in recent years and as a result have become growing economic, agricultural, environmental, and health related problems. All too often, the strategies and compounds used to control insect pests or disease vectors are increasingly ineffective or potentially harmful to man and the environment. In order to improve on existing insect control strategies a greater understanding of how insects excrete potentially toxic compounds is needed.  My proposed research will take advantage of the recent advances in insect genomic science to identify and physiologically characterize mechanisms responsible for excretion of toxic organic molecules such as pesticides, and excretion of potentially toxic metals by the Malpighian (renal) tubule of both aquatic and terrestrial insects.  Benefits of this research include: 1) Identifying new targets for the development of novel effective and environmentally benign insect control measures: 2) Helping us understand how insects adapt to different environments and how environmental pollutants may have deleterious effects on beneficial insect populations. 3) Transport proteins identified as a result of this research could become potential biomarkers for toxicant exposure. 4) Development of different species of insects as sentinel organisms for detecting environmental toxicant release. 5) Results of this research can be utilized for the development of sound environmental policy with regard to the release of toxicants into the environment. In addition, this research program will provide broad scientific training in molecular biology, physiology, and toxicology, which will provide trainees with the skills required for a variety of biology related jobs in academia, industry and government.

"Even that biological membranes have been studied for decades, very few biologically relevant processes could be revealed on a molecular level. The reason is the combination of very small nanometer length scales and at the same time very fast dynamics of pico- and nanoseconds, which poses particular experimental challenges. The dynamics involve processes from fast motions of lipid molecules and small protein groups to slow conformational changes of large membrane areas and of membrane embedded proteins. Biological materials are therefore considered as ""multi-scale"" materials and in order to fully characterize the fluctuations experiments must cover an as large as possible range of length and time scales. This issue can only be addressed by using multiple physical techniques and instruments. We propose to combine neutron, x-ray and light scattering techniques to conduct ""broadband membrane and protein spectroscopy"".



Artificial membranes with different amounts of the elementary constituents, such as cholesterol and proteins, will be prepared in our laboratory. By investigating these model systems we will be able control the biological and physiological properties of membranes and proteins. This is very important to establish dynamics-function relationships, i.e., to assign dynamics to certain functionalities. The main research objective is to study dynamics of membrane embedded proteins and how composition and physical properties of the surrounding bilayer affect protein function. This knowledge can eventually be used to enhance or suppress functioning of membrane embedded proteins to, e.g., facilitate drug transport through the cell membrane. The methodology is expected to be greatly exploited in the development of biosensors and detection of protein functions at the molecular level.

"The bloodfluke Schistosoma mansoni causes a debilitating disease called schistosomiasis that afflicts over 200 million people worldwide. At present, there are few drugs available for treatment of schistosomiasis and the incidence of drug resistance is rising. In this study, we are studying the process by which schistosomes control movement within the host. The parasites exhibit an intricate pattern of migration in the bloodstream, moving through the heart and lungs towards their final destination  in the hepatic portal system, where the mature worms typically reside. This migration is controlled by the parasite's own neuromuscular system and by host-derived substances that influence motility. Our goal is to identify the mechanisms involved in this regulation, in particular the receptors that mediate muscle contraction in the parasite. Through these studies we hope to learn more about the basic biology of schistosomes and to discover more effective forms of treatment against this serious disease.","Advancement of knowledge","McGill University",3,"RGPAS ","Discovery Grants Program - Accelerator Supplements","Biologie mol�culaire","Biologie mol�culaire"

"The central topic of my research is the investigation of certain mathematical structures, namely groups, which are quite ubiquitous. Evolution in physics, symmetry in geometry, combinatorial structures, properties of natural numbers (e.g., the famous last theorm of Fermat), study of codes and cryptography, etc., are instances of phenomena that  are often best understood in terms of groups. 



I am especially interested in Galois groups; these arise, for example, in the study of roots of  polynomials. The Galois group of a  polynomial equation consists of functions that permute  the roots of that equation respecting the basic properties of the polynomial. The structure of such a Galois groups indicate to us, for example, whether or not there exist formulas to express the roots of the polynomial in terms of its coefficients.","Mathematical sciences","Carleton University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual"," alg�bre","Math�matiques pures"

"Biological invasions are a disruptive stressor that is becoming increasingly frequent in freshwater and marine systems worldwide.  The longterm goal of my research program is to develop a predictive understanding of the factors that determine the success and impact of invasive species in aquatic environments.  My lab will pursue three major lines of research over the next five years.  We will investigate: (1) how community-level impacts (e.g. extinctions) caused by invasive species vary with environmental conditions; (2) whether the success and impact of an invasive species can be predicted from its life history traits; and (3) whether the impacts of invasive species are predictable across a range of habitat types and spatial scales.  These investigations will involve a combination of experimental studies and statistical analyses of data from documented invasions worldwide.  A series of field experiments in the St. Lawrence River will investigate the factors that determine the replacement of one dominant invader by another. On canal walls, we will clear patches of competing Eurasian mussels (the zebra mussel and the quagga mussel) at multiple sites and across multiple depths, and subsequently monitor patterns of recolonization and subsequent species dominance of cleared patches over time and how these patterns vary temporally and spatially.  Another series of experiments will examine the influence of zebra mussel colonies on the diversity of benthic invertebrates at small spatial scales. We will also investigate how antagonistic interactions (mutual predation) between a native and invasive crustacean vary across water chemistry gradients, so as to reveal the conditions in which one species or the other dominates.  Finally, using meta-analytical techniques, we will examine a global dataset of bivalve invasions to determine if there are predictable patterns of impact that can be related to the life history characteristics of a species, the composition of the invaded community, and the physical characteristics of the invaded habitat.  Together, these studies aim to produce useful generalizations and predictive models that are currently lacking for aquatic invasions.","Conservation and preservation","McGill University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","�cologie aquatique et limnologie","�volution et �cologie"

"Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), discovered in 1997 and named UCP2 because of its homology of sequence (58%) with UCP1 (the archetypical UCP), has been reported in recent years to be involved in many biological functions, which have yet to be fully unravelled. In contrast to UCP1, a thermogenic protein found in brown adipose tissue, UCP2 is expressed in several tissues where it does not exert a thermogenic function. One probable function of UCP2 is the control of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which tends to confer a role for this protein in the ROS-induced cellular damages observed during inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. It is expressed in humans and one of its striking features is that it is distributed in the brain in a pattern forecasting neuroendocrine, behavioural, autonomic and neuroprotective functions. Recent studies have brought the focus on the role that brain UCP2 can play in energy homeostasis and neuroprotection. 



In that respect, we have elaborated the present research program, whose goal is to delineate the brain functions of UCP2. The program has two main objectives. The first objective is to investigate the role of brain UCP2 in energy homeostasis. Specifically, we propose (i) to determine the mechanisms whereby Ucp2-/- mice resist high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, (ii) to delineate a function for brain UCP2 in glucose, fatty acid and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) sensing. The second objective is to investigate the role of UCP2 in neuronal protection. Specifically, we intend (i) to assess whether kainic acid (KA)-induced UCP2 induction can exert neuroprotective effects in the hippocampus, and (ii) to determine the mechanisms whereby KA induces UCP2 in the brain hippocampus.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Universit� Laval",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Physiologie et m�tabolisme des animaux","Biologie animale"
"In large animals of economical interest, reproduction is a major challenge for production as dairy cow. The

production of one good female gamete is a critical step in the process of embryonic development. Even if the

required time to prepare an oocyte will last for several months, the crucial events for developmental

competence acquisition is occurring around the final maturation of the follicles, a step happening before

ovulation. In spite of embryo production is feasible for several decades; the yield is still not optimal especially

when oocytes are from small follicle diameters. One of the proposed strategies to improve this competence is to

influence the oocyte with the late follicular signalling while the oocyte is maintained in meiotic arrest as it

occurs naturally in the follicle. We have recently identified two highly interesting inhibitory candidates secreted

by somatic cells of the follicle. We have developed the so-called ""Stop-Egg-Go"" as a physiological treatment to

efficiently maintain mammalian cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) in meiotic arrest. This approach is of high

commercial relevance. By delaying nuclear maturation using ""Stop-Egg-Go"" treatment it will provide a critical

window to improve developmental competence of oocytes, an essential step to increase embryo producti",Agriculture,"Universit� Laval",1,"I2IPJ ","Idea to Innovation","Reproduction animale","Biologie animale"
"Many functions of sperm physiology are regulated by cyclic nucleotides. Specifically, cyclic adenosine

monophosphate is involved in crucial events in sperm maturation process as motility, capacitation and

acrosome reaction. Cyclic nucleotides are synthesized by cyclases to reach a threshold level activating kinases,

phosphodiesterases and ion gated-channels. Intracellular content of cyclic nucleotides depends not only on

synthesis but on degradation by PDE. Nothing is known on the impact of cryopreservation on bovine semen

phosphodiesterases activity. We have developed a test measuring phosphodiesterase activity in bovine semen.

This grant application is aiming to further demonstrate that these technologies will offer a commercial

advantage for Canadian insemination industries by optimizing the use of semen in each straw, a market of

several million dollars.

"Reproduction is the basis of all agricultural animal production. To sustain innovation in the porcine and bovine industry and to disseminate reproductive biotechnologies, fundamental physiological knowledge about the production of healthy oocytes through oocyte maturation must be acquired. Several milestones punctuate egg preparation: growth, meiotic competence, meiosis, fertilization and embryonic development. The competence of the oocyte to develop into an embryo is progressively acquired during growth of the follicle. In the pre-ovulatory follicle, the oocyte is released from meiotic arrest upon the luteinizing hormone surge. However, when oocyte meiotic competence is acquired in antral follicles, meiosis is resumed spontaneously in vitro. This research program will focus on (1) the newly described role of adenosine, (2) the role of gap junction communication and (3) the role of lipid raft microdomains all in porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes during in vitro maturation. The quality of the egg is influenced by the functionality of resumption of meiosis. Thus, the immediate practical consequence will be to offer a better way of signalling the meiotic resumption to improve developmental competence. In the near future, a more accurate stimulation of the induction of ovulation will consider the need of the oocyte for meiotic resumption. This is of practical interest if such oocytes are eventually to be used as a resource for propagating valuable domestic animals or members of endangered species and, finally, for improving IVM strategies.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Universit� Laval",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Reproduction animale","Biologie animale"
"La mod�lisation dynamique, de nos jours, est la pierre angulaire de l'implantation de tous syst�mes m�caniques.

"My research will entail investigations into the basic perceptual and cognitive processes involved in object and shape perception, and the associated limitations that attention places on these processes. In the real world, observers often interact with a cluttered and noisy visual environment containing multiple objects. These visual objects also vary in complexity (i.e., features and shapes), and often require us to divide our attention between objects and tasks. Because real-world visual tasks often require observers to divide their attention between multiple objects and tasks, I will utilize behavioural tasks that mimic real-world tasks. For example, my work will involve the use of divided-attention paradigms in which two tasks are completed simultaneously (i.e., divided-attention paradigms). My research will also endeavour to uncover how observers utilize visual information with more naturalistic visual shapes such as faces. The results of this research will improve our understanding of the constraints on perceptual and cognitive representations, and the extent to which the visual and cognitive systems adapt to different real-world contexts. These research topics are important not only because humans frequently encounter challenging visual situations in the real world, but also because these investigations will provide important information about how humans organize and process shape information more generally. Ultimately, rehabilitative strategies can be developed to offset perceptual deficits in different clinical populations (e.g., individuals with autism and seniors).

"Recreational fishing in Canada provides more than 4.9 billion dollars in economic activity both directly through fish culture and license sales and indirectly through the promotion of tourism.  Most of Canada's popular fishing lakes are stocked annually with various species of fish, particularly rainbow trout, from hatcheries to mitigate the impacts of intense fishing activity on natural, wild fish populations.  However, most of these stocking programs, particularly in British Columbia experience very high stocking mortality rates, particularly in triploid fish.  Triploidy is a means of creating non-reproductive fish, which have the benefit of eliminating the exchange of genetic material between stocked fish and wild populations.  In British Columbia alone, the Freshwater Fisheries Society of BC (FFSBC) stocks over 5 million trout a year (~2.5 million as triploids) into > 900 lakes and in some cases up to 70% of the fish introduced into a lake die within days or weeks of stocking. The precise reasons for these high death rates are not known, but there is evidence that variation in lake chemistry and stocked/wild fish competition may both be important contributors to this high mortality.  FFSBC has access to many different types (called strains) of trout for stocking programs, but the overall performance and competitiveness of these different strains or the effects of creating triploids on survival and performance under different environmental conditions are not known.  This grant will characterize the performance and environmental tolerance of various strains of trout and examine the effects of selective breeding between strains on the overall performance of diploid and triploid trout.  The goal of this research partnership is to work toward understanding why triploid fish do not perform well in natural environments compared with their diploid counterparts.  The long-term goal of this partnership is to develop a triploid fish with superior performance and low mortality rates could save the FFSBC more that 1.8 million dollars a year and help revitalize recreational fishing in British Columbia and Canada.",Aquaculture,"University of British Columbia",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Production et reproduction animales","Biologie animale"

"With increasing demand for mineral commodities to support growing world population and consumption rates, and declining discovery rates in mature mineral belts, exploration for new mineral deposits must push into previously unexplored or superficially explored frontier regions. Research proposed here will advance geological knowledge related to the formation and distribution of mineral deposits associated with convergent plate margin processes in two major frontier exploration regions of the world: the Central Andes of South America (principally northwest Argentina) and the Tethyan belt of the Balkans, Turkey, and Iran. The Canadian and international mining industry is investing heavily in exploration in these regions, but in many cases knowledge of the regional and local geological settings is lacking or incomplete. This project aims to fill these voids through geological mapping, geochemical and isotopic analyses, and dating of mineralization-related rocks. Detailed studies of individual mineral deposits will also be carried out, and combined with syntheses of regional geological history to yield integrated models of ore formation. This geological knowledge is useful in its own right because it will extend our understanding of ore-forming processes in these previously poorly understood regions. In addition, it will also provide valuable direction for regional scale mineral exploration, which will be of direct benefit to the mining industry. At least four graduate students will be involved in this project, and will receive training in a wide variety of field and analytical techniques, as well as exposure to industry practices and priorities.  Such training will provide valuable preparation for future employment in the geosciences sectors of industry, government, or academia.

    My research also involves a major commitment to the application of sustainable development principles in the minerals industry. Although specific support for this work is not sought in this proposal, I bring this perspective to bear on all my dealings with industry and graduate students through my writings, seminars, teaching, and consulting work.

"Altruism is behaviour in which an individual sacrifices its own reproduction in order to help other individuals reproduce. How do genes for altruism spread through populations when they are at a fitness disadvantage? The puzzle is often explained by kin selection: altruists do sacrifice personal reproduction, but more than make up for it by helping to raise close relatives which share their genes.  Kin selection suggests that altruism can spread through populations when altruists target their cooperative behaviour towards raising relatives, which, like their own offspring, also carry the altruist's genes.  Altruistic animals live in societies, and some of the best known are those of social insects, including many species of bees.  In two bee groups, the sweat bees and carpenter bees, behaviour is highly variable, from bees that are completely solitary and raise their young with no help from other bees, to egalitarian or 'communal' societies where all individuals are equally cooperative, to caste-based societies composed of selfish queens and altruistic workers.  My research is geared towards explaining this variation in bee societies.  I am also studying why some individual females are more likely to be altruistic than others.  I am testing several theories to explain both altruism and the forms of bee societies.  These theories include kin selection, the female quality hypothesis, which suggests that small, weak or infertile females are more likely to become helpers than breeders, and the environmental quality hypothesis, which suggests that bees are more likely to form societies in environments where colonies are more productive if adults cooperate.  For more than 50 years, biologists have been accumulating observations on bee social diversity.  The studies proposed here will allow me and my students to address important questions about animal social behaviour, questions that have preoccupied evolutionary biologists for decades, but which until recently, have not been amenable to study.

"A very large proportion of the energy used within stream food webs is derived from terrestrial plant material and other external sources, i.e., ecosystem subsidies.  There are many sources of variation in the food quality, quantity, and availability of these materials for consumer organisms within the stream community.  This proposal will address the causes and consequences of such resource heterogeneity.  The causes of variation include timing of availability of particular resources (e.g. leaf litter, salmon carcasses, etc.) and changes in the physical drivers of their availability, such as hydrology, geomorphology, light inputs and temperature.  Many of these physical drivers affect retention of these resources, and drivers are also expected to change in timing and magnitude under climate change scenarios. The resources themselves are heterogeneous and represent a complex assortment of organic carbon and various micro-organisms (fungi, bacteria, and algae). How these various micro-organisms interact with each other and with carbon sources will influence food quality and quantity for animals but the consequences are not well known.  This series of experiments will test hypotheses about the nature of the variation in these food materials as the basis of productivity of food webs of small streams and the consequences for the aquatic community.  Many species within aquatic communities are considered to be obligate consumers of leaf detritus, but alternate resources for consumers in some streams include salmon carcasses and biofilms, and these are highly patchy in time and space.  Hence, the contributions of other resources are short-lived, patchy, or both, but may be potentially important because of their high quality.  Our experiments will manipulate the quality and quantity of resources, light inputs, physical structure, and even hydrology (using short-distance diversions) to test impacts on growth and survival of consumer invertebrates and their community. Shifts in food resources are expected as a consequence of variation in climate, changes in terrestrial vegetation, and enhanced nutrient concentrations from airborne transport, and our work will test predictions of expected impacts.

"This research investigates the  brain mechanisms of attention.  Attention is an important factor in perception and movement, ensuring decisions appropriate for our goals while managing the distracting influence of other stimuli and responses.  Attention deficits can have very serious effects on achievement and autonomy, underlining the importance of better understanding these functions. We know that anterior brain regions and their interactions with other brain regions are critical for successful attention. Our work studies the specifics of these interactions using brain imaging in normal adults and also by analyzing performance deficits in patients with damage to anterior brain systems.  Some studies examine the interference between successive stimuli presented in close proximity.  Their competition for attention produces performance problems and activity changes in key parts of the brain.  Other studies examine the competition between conflicting responses during movements.  This competition also brings important information about the role of anterior brain systems in attention.  This research will help understand the mechanisms of attention which can help us better understand normal performance limitations and also help predict the impact of brain disorders.",Psychology,"Universit� du Qu�bec � Montr�al",2,"RGPGP ","Discovery Grants Program - Group","Science cognitive -- principes fondamentaux",Psychologie

"Our research interests span the fields of catalysis, synthetic inorganic, organometallic and materials chemistry. The implementation of rigid, chelating, electron-delocalized ligands is an established strength of our program. We will continue to demonstrate the versatility of these species with transition and main group element chemistry in the design of new catalytically active compounds, as molecular precursors to solids, and for supporting fundamentally important bonding features and functionalities. 

We have constructed new stable singlet carbenes possessing a novel scaffold and electronic structure. The ability of these compounds to stabilize catalytically relevant metal complexes is ongoing and two examples are represented complexes of Au, Pd, Ni and Cu.  

The catalytic formation and transformation of carbon-nitrogen bonds is dynamic area of investigation. We are developing new catalysts, examining these reactions computationally and defining new targets. Novel catalyst use unconventional main group species based on lithium and aluminum. Our computational efforts have revealed key features of these reactions. We have shown that the carbenes described in this proposal allow us to prepare catalysts for CN bond transformation. 

We target switchable magnetic nanomaterials designed around the two different spin states of some transition metal ions bonded to nitrogen rich ligands. In particular we are targeting cooperative effects by employing dendrimers as the supporting framework for magnetic networks.

We are taking a lesson from nature and investigating catalytic routes to halogen introduction inspired by mononuclear iron-based halogenase enzymes. Our approach is to use a ""reaction driven"" search that will take advantage of the unique and very powerful high-throughput tools (Symyx Discovery Tools) available at the University of Ottawa. An improved understanding of the routes toward halogenation could lead to the development of novel synthetic methods for the creation of new medicinally relevant compounds.

"A large portion of the housing stock needed to accommodate the Canadian population has already been built. In the past five years there have been over a million housing starts across Canada. But, because of a significant lack of attention to sustainable building designs this opportunity to deal with low-impact housing through new construction has been squandered. Throughout the next ten to twenty years, the existing Canadian housing stock (new and old) will require significant upgrades and renovations. There is an urgent need to look at how remedial actions through renovation might be able to transform existing energy and environmental inefficient buildings into more sustainable homes.  The proposed research aims to create, develop and contribute to a new sector in low-energy home design focused on Sustainable Renovation Challenges, Principles, Validated Designs, and Outreach. 

This research extends the concept of sustainable buildings beyond the current focus on energy efficiency.  To truly be sustainable, a building should: (i) be durable, (ii) be healthy for the occupant(s), (iii) be comfortable for the occupant(s), (iv) use materials with low environmental impact, as well as (v) satisfy energy consumption.

Through computer simulation, laboratory and field testing, the proposed research aims to create, develop and validate sustainable renovation concepts/techniques and strategies applicable to the Canadian housing stock.  A model framework will be developed to conduct evaluation of sustainable renovation challenges and opportunities on a home by home basis.  The framework will also provide a basis for evaluating and indexing outcomes of sustainable renovation activities.  It is anticipated that results from this research will influence aspects of Provincial Building Codes in order to raise the required standards of both existing and new home construction.

I have a long-standing interest in drawing graphs (or networks) in the plane so as to minimize the number of crossing points of edges.  This is related to the design of a computer chip.  Finding a drawing with a minimum number of crossings is difficult in general.  Much of my work has centred on finding optimal drawings for certain special cases and trying to improve the arguments in specific cases to apply more generally.



Many facts about finite networks either use proof techniques or have a form that suggests they might be applicable in much greater generality.  For example, we have recently been able to describe when a member of a large class of standard topological spaces is contained in the sphere and previously characterized which such spaces are uniquely embeddable in the sphere.  By pursuing this work, I hope to broaden the available methods and results from graph theorists to other mathematicians.

"Glucocorticoids are naturally occurring hormones that have several functions within the body, which include control of blood sugar levels, mobilization of fat and protein stores and immune suppression. During periods of stress, the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis releases high levels of glucocorticoids that prepare the organism for defence. Chronic elevations in glucocorticoids are undesirable, however, and appear to be linked to a number of immune, growth, neurological and metabolic disorders. As such, glucocorticoids must be tightly regulated within the body via specific glucocorticoid receptors in the brain and pituitary gland (i.e. negative feedback) and by enzymes in the various target tissues (e.g. fat, muscle and liver) that can either activate or inactivate local glucocorticoids. Poor regulation of glucocorticoids and chronic elevations in HPA activity are thought to be critical in the development of a common clinical condition called the Metabolic Syndrome (insulin resistance, high blood glucose, central obesity and high blood pressure), although the exact mechanism for this is unclear. Paradoxically, regular exercise, which is a potent activator of the HPA activity, is beneficial in preventing or improving many of these metabolic disorders. My laboratory is interested in determining if regular exercise (i.e. training) influences: 1) basal HPA activity; 2) HPA feedback sensitivity and; 3) local glucocorticoid activation. Moreover, we are particularly interested if some of the preventative effects of regular exercise on the development of the Metabolic Syndrome are via alterations in the HPA axis. We have recently shown that short term exercise behaviour increases resting HPA activity, while long term training causes a reduction in basal activity in healthy rodents. These adaptations appear to be mediated by changes in the gene expression of key regulatory proteins in the brain and pituitary gland as well as by changing the adrenal gland sensitivity to produce glucocorticoids. We are now interested in elucidating the molecular mechanisms for central and peripheral HPA adaptation to training and to explore the links between exercise, HPA activity and disease prevention.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","York University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Physiologie et m�tabolisme des animaux","Biologie animale"

"GOAL: To investigate what constitutes effective, robust, and intuitive human spatial orientation and behaviour. This fundamental knowledge will be applied to design novel, more effective human-computer interfaces and interaction paradigms that enable similar processes in computer-mediated environments like virtual reality (VR) and multi-media. MOTIVATION: While modern VR simulations can have stunning photorealism, they are typically unable to provide a life-like and compelling sensation of moving through the simulated world, thus limiting perceived realism, behavioural effectiveness, user acceptance, and commercial success. APPROACH: I propose that investigating and exploiting self-motion illusions might be a lean and elegant way to overcome such shortcomings and provide a truly ""moving experience"" in computer-mediated environments. Multi-modal, naturalistic and immersive VR provides a unique opportunity to study human perception and behaviour in reproducible, clearly defined and controllable experimental conditions in a closed action-perception loop.  SHORT/MID-TERM GOALS: To perform experiments with na�ve human participants in VR to investigate and optimize multi-modal and higher-level contributions and interactions for spatial orientation and self-motion perception, while minimizing reference frame conflicts. LONG-TERM GOALS: To investigate how we can best employ self-motion illusion in VR to enable life-like, robust and effortless spatial orientation and behaviour in VR. SIGNIFICANCE: This research will lead to a deeper understanding of human perception and behavior that enables us to design more effective human-computer interfaces and interaction paradigms. In particular, applied research will identify the essential parameters of perception/action and pin-point the ""blind spots"" that will enable us to trick the brain when simulating VR.  This will enable the creation of better, cost-effective, virtual solutions for numerous applications, such as driving/flight simulation, space exploration, education, gaming, engineering, recreation, emergency training, video conferencing, minimally invasive surgery, and telemedicine.","Information systems and technology","Simon Fraser University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","R�alit� virtuelle et simulations connexes","Technologie de l'information"
"Naturally-occurring, ice-like gas hydrates form when gases (mainly methane) combine with water at low temperature and high pressure. These conditions are found in the sediment section on deep sea continental slopes where the water depth is greater than about 600 m, including offshore Vancouver Island and in permafrost regions of the Canadian Arctic. Natural gas hydrates represent a very large global reservoir of natural gas. Globally they are estimated to contain more organic carbon than all other fossil fuel sources combined. Gas hydrate is important because of its potential as a large source of future clean energy, but also because of potential risks associated with these deposits. These include the potential for a significant impact on climate change (methane is a strong greenhouse gas) and its role in seafloor stability hazard. The Canadian west coast has large and well-mapped occurrences of marine hydrate in the large subduction zone accretionary sedimentary prism on the continental slope. Large gas hydrate deposits are also known to occur in the Canadian Arctic, especially in the Mckenzie Delta at the Mallik site (NWT).

The proposed research topics include developing new strategies for remote geophysical sensing techniques to (a) assess magnitude and nature of gas hydrate reservoirs in marine and permafrost environments, (b) long-time monitoring experiments using seafloor and deep-borehole observatories to understand temporal variability in fluid/gas fluxes in accretionary prisms in conjunction with the NEPTUNE observatory. These studies will contribute to the global understanding of the role of gas hydrates as a potential future energy resource, their role in past and future climate change, and their potential as a geologic hazard in areas with active offshore/onshore industry activities.

"Weeds and invasive plants impose a major economic burden on Canada.  Weeds lower crop yield, reduce the quality of rangelands, and lead to the expenditure of billions of dollars in chemical and biological control measures.  These direct economic costs have been estimated at C$30-50 billion annually in North America.  Besides direct economic costs, weeds and invasive plants pose a major threat to Canada's biodiversity, through destruction of native plant and animal habitat.   

The efficient control of weeds and invasive plants requires knowledge.  What makes a weed a weed?  Why are some plants able to grow rapidly and invade new habitats while related species do not?  Are there repeated genetic changes that occur independently in different weeds?  If funded, we will tackle these fundamental biological questions.

Little is currently known about the genetic changes that cause weedy species to be noxious while closely related plant species are harmless.  We will identify these genetic changes by comparing the genomes of several pairs of weedy and non-weedy plants within the family Compositae.  The Composites include ~25,000 species of plants and represent 10% of flowering plants.  Several Composites are important crop species, including lettuce and sunflower, yet many others are noxious weeds, including thistle, knapweed, ragwort, and dandelion.  This proposal  targets many of the worst weeds in Canada.

The knowledge generated by our research will have numerous economic benefits to Canada and beyond.  Knowing the genetic traits that are critical to weediness will improve the development of herbicides specifically targeted to noxious plants.  Targeted herbicides reduce the costs (both economic and ecological) associated with non-specific herbicides and are less toxic to crop and native plant species.  Identifying the genetic changes that occur in weeds will allow us to assess the potential risks posed by imported plant species and by genetically modified plants.

"First posed early in the twentieth century, the famous Burnside Problem for groups asked: Is every finitely generated periodic group finite?  The Kurosh-Levitzki Problem is an associative algebra analogue: Is every finitely generated nil algebra finite-dimensional?  Counterexamples were first constructed by Golod and Shafarevich in the 1960's.  It was natural, therefore, to reformulate these problems with additional hypotheses in order to obtain a positive solution. Zelmanov won the prestigious Fields Medal in 1994 for his proof that every finitely generated residually finite group is finite, thereby solving the so-called Restricted Burnside Problem for groups.  I have extended Zelmanov's seminal work in group and Lie theory to a single unified theory that has direct applications to other branches of algebra.  In particular, I have proved that a finitely generated nil algebra is finite-dimensional if it is infinitesimially PI.  This is a significant generalisation Zelmanov's results. I have also had some success in applying my new theory to Kaplansky's Problem which addresses the structure of group algebras whose augmentational ideal is Jacobson radical.  Zelmanov has referred to Kaplansky's Problem as the next big hurdle in group theory after the Restricted Burnside Problem.  



The solution of the Restricted Burnside Problem is equivalent to saying every pro-finite group of finite exponent is locally finite. Zelmanov went on to prove even more: every periodic pro-finite group is locally finite. Together, Wilson and Zelmanov proved a related result: every Engelian pro-finite group is locally nilpotent. These results led to the natural generalizations to all compact groups. 



Recently, I have been working on the Lie-theoretic analogues of these problems. In particular, a former PhD student and I have proved that all Engelian pro-finite Lie rings are locally nilpotent. We also proved similar results for pro-finite restricted Lie algebras. I would like to extend these results to the general compact cases.

"The dynamic evolution of the System Earth is chiefly controlled by internal generation and loss of energy, evident by plate-tectonic and magmatic processes, and external energy gain such as meteorite impact processes. An understanding of these processes, on variable length and time scales, underlies my research. Specifically, I propose to wok on: (1) analysis of fault systems and their effect on the activity of volcanic centres in the Central Andes (NW Argentina); (2) crustal deformation of orogenic belts, notably the Eastern Penokean Orogen (Ontario); and (3) formation of complex impact craters (Haughton, Devon Island, and Sudbury, Ontario). Because of their significance for geological hazard assessment and localizing natural resource deposits, these research fields have strong socio-economic importance. Key to all projects will be the visualization of the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of deformed rock volumes, restoration to their pre-deformational shapes, and analysis of deformation mechanisms. This approach promises to result in a better understanding of dynamic rock deformation from the mm- to the crustal scales, and on various time scales, more specifically, eruptive triggers of volcanic complexes, transport and emplacement of endogenic melts, stress accumulation, ore deposit genesis and impact crater formation. In the long run, I intend to close the gap between geological field and the numerical modelling studies by linking structural geological ground truth gleaned from process-oriented studies of natural laboratories with quantitative kinematic restoration of deformation and (analogue) modelling studies. This approach contributes also to generating more realistic models of rock deformation. My research on the formation and localization of ore deposits, addressed in collaboration with industry, will contribute to designing process-oriented exploration strategies. Neo- and volcanotectonic studies will help in mitigating potential seismic and volcanic hazards, most importantly for highly populated areas.","Earth sciences","McMaster University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Sciences de la terre (voir aussi g�ologie marine, 4604)","Sciences de la terre"

"Dr. Jack Rink is engaged in the determination of the age of ancient coastlines. Using new dating techniques developed in Canada, we determine the time that the sand on these coastlines was deposited. This in turn allows us to know the time and height of ancient high sea levels in the recent geological past (last million years or so). These studies of ancient sea levels are very important to our understanding of climate change in general because we can use the results to refine global climate models. Dating the time that humans occupy ancient shorelines that occur on land and submerged underwater is another aspect of this work that contributes to our understanding of human history within the natural environment. Another project involves conservation of endangered sea turtles. Sea turtles are known to have a magnetic sense, apparently using magnetic navigation to orient themselves in long ocean journeys. Our work indicates that the earth's geomagnetic field strength along the nesting coastline is influencing how these turtles select their nest locations. In addition, human magnetic infrastructure in the form of seawalls in front of condominiums on the beach has also been shown to disrupt the natural nesting behaviour of the turtles. New studies in this area are planned to increase our understanding of these phenomena, which should lead to new conservation methods to improve reproductive success in these animals.

"Mitochondria are structures inside cells which provide energy for all cellular functions. These organelles have been called ""semi-autonomous"" in that they have their own DNA, they fuse, divide and have surprising mobility within cells.  The significance of these dynamic events is unknown.  While the current proposal focuses on mitochondrial fusion, related techniques will be employed to extend these studies to examine the reciprocal event, mitochondrial fission.  The long term goals of this research program are to identify the machinery of mitochondrial fission and fusion and to elucidate the functional roles of these dynamic changes in mammalian cells.

Using fluorescently labeled mitochondria, fusion can be observed directly within living cells employing fluorescence microscopy.  Using this technique we will endeavor to answer the question: What are the cellular cues and participants in mitochondrial fusion?  In addition, we will examine the impact of mitochondrial fusion upon mitochondrial function and cell physiology; how do changes in mitochondria morphology affect mitochondrial function?  What are the cellular consequences of mitochondria fusion?  Pursuing the answers to the above questions will yield clues as to how and why mitochondria fuse, and foster a greater understanding of the role of mitochondria in cells.

"This program is concentrated in different areas of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), with the common thread that they concern problems where the coefficients are ""rough"" or where the equations do not satisfy a certain desirable structural assumption (called ellipticity), what makes their treatment more challenging. Such PDEs are of paramount importance in pure and applied sciences, since they greatly contribute to the understanding of phenomena such as heat transfer, market pricing, electrodynamics, and celestial mechanics, among many others.

    )	

One objective is to find new applications for a powerful technique, the Partial Legendre Transform (PLT), that we developed to treat certain nonlinear equations. In particular, we can treat Monge-Ampere equations with various degrees of degeneracy. These equations are related to the concept of curvature in geometry and they model a wide variety of applications, including some in the areas of optimal transport and meteorology. 

    )	

The prominent ""Kato square root problem"" was solved recently for (nondegenerate) elliptic operators. This result has applications to hyperbolic equations, which describe the movement of waves and therefore model sound, light, and quantum phenomena. We will study a generalization of this problem for degenerate elliptic operators. The significance of this research derives from the fact that many real life phenomena do not necessarily satisfy the classical assumptions of ellipticity.

    )	

We also propose to study the solvability of boundary problems for linear elliptic equations with rough coefficients. The understanding of these more basic type of equations is crucial for the evolution of the theory of nonlinear equations.

"La culture et la r�colte du bleuet nain repr�sente un secteur important de l'agriculture canadienne. En 2006, seulement pour le Qu�bec, la valeur des r�coltes de bleuets est estim�e � 75 millions de dollars (143 millions pour le Canada). La culture du bleuet se r�alise dans des champs am�nag�s, o� la plante est naturellement pr�sente. La r�gie habituelle comporte une rotation de 2 ans, o� la premi�re ann�e est d�di�e � la croissance v�g�tative du plant, alors que la r�colte se fait au cours de la seconde ann�e. Les plants sont ensuite fauch�s au niveau du sol et le cycle reprend. Afin de diminuer leurs co�ts de production, de plus en plus de producteurs d�sirent r�colter des fruits une deuxi�me ann�e cons�cutive avant de faucher. Les �tudes ant�rieures d�montrent que la fertilisation, entre autres, doit �tre modifi�e pour donner un rendement int�ressant en deuxi�me ann�e.

L'ensemble des r�sultats vise � d�velopper des outils permettant au producteur de faire un choix � la fin du premier �t� de r�colte, � savoir s'il peut conserver un ou des champs pour une seconde ann�e de r�colte, ou s'il doit faucher. En effet, nous croyons qu'une r�gie de production du bleuet sur trois ans doit �tre adapt�e aux conditions agro-environnementales auxquelles sont soumis les plants et que, comme ces conditions varient d'une ann�e � l'autre, le producteur devra � l'occasion utiliser une rotation de deux ans.","Agriculture and primary food production","Universit� Laval",2,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Nutrition et m�tabolisme, photosynth�se","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres"

"This application seeks funding for an experimental platform to support the exploration of the following three hypotheses. First, we believe that active storage techniques can be efficiently and transparently integrated with massively multi-core compute resources to accelerate the execution of data-intensive applications in fields as diverse as medical image analysis and bioinformatics. The second hypothesis is that the computational power of these massively multi-core processors can be harnessed not only to accelerate specialized applications, but also to accelerate, enhance, or reduce the cost of generic storage systems. Inexpensive computation can be used to support core techniques that impact storage systems' reliability, security, or performance by using, for example, erasure coding, encryption, or on-the-fly data compression. Finally, the third hypothesis is that a specific class of commodity multi-core processors, namely graphical processing units (GPUs), can be effectively used in the above context.



This application seeks funding to build a small experimental platform to explore the above hypotheses. More specifically we plan to acquire four workstations able to host the latest GPU models. This platform will be used will be used to design, prototype and test active storage services that process large data volumes. In addition to synthetic workloads, we will use medical imaging applications (e.g., medical image compression, reconstruction, segmentation, multi- and intra-modal registration) to anchor this project with realistic workloads, demonstrate feasibility and asses performance gains.

"The rate of progress in a number of scientific fields (e.g., bioinformatics), as well as the productivity of highly-trained professionals that interactively use data-intensive computing systems (e.g., radiologists), are limited by the peace at which computing systems are able to manage and process large volumes of data.

      To address this issue this is proposal is set to explore two hypotheses. First, we believe that active storage techniques can be efficiently and transparently integrated with today's massively multi-core processors (e.g., Graphics Processing Units or GPUs) to accelerate the execution of data-intensive applications in fields as diverse as bioinformatics and medical image analysis. The second hypothesis is that the order-of-magnitude reduction in computation costs massively multi core devices offer can be harnessed not only to accelerate specialized applications, but also to accelerate, enhance, or reduce the cost of generic storage systems. Inexpensive computation can be used to support key techniques that impact storage systems reliability, security, or performance by using erasure coding, data similarity detection, encryption, or on-the-fly compression.

      We plan to: (i) study the viability of offloading data-processing intensive operations to the GPU; in addition to synthetic workloads we will use medical imaging storage and processing systems to anchor this project with realistic workloads, demonstrate feasibility, and asses performance gains (ii) develop accurate performance models that will inform when outsourcing to the GPU is advantageous and will guide the performance optimization efforts; (iii) improve development and runtime support (e.g., GPU-specific memory management, automated choice of parallelism levels and thread mapping) that will reduce the cost of application migration while extracting maximum performance; and, finally, (iv) explore solutions to virtualize the GPU and share it between multiple applications. Progress along each of the above directions would represent a valuable contribution to the body of theoretical/practical knowledge related to storage system design.","Information systems and technology","University of British Columbia",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Traitement r�parti et simultan�","Technologie de l'information"

"Different fish species have characteristic responses to pathogens.  For example, Atlantic salmon are susceptible to the viral pathogen causing Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA), while other salmonids such as rainbow trout, brown trout, and Arctic char, are resistant to ISA.  It is also known that different fish species may respond differently to environmental stress such as increased ambient temperature.  The genes and biochemical pathways involved in species-specific differences in fish immune and stress responses are poorly understood.  My research program will use the power of genomics to reveal the key genes involved in fish defense against pathogens and environmental stress.  This work uses genomic tools such as DNA microarrays (gene chips), which allow the researcher to study the expression of thousands of known genes simultaneously.  In addition, because currently available fish microarrays are missing many genes, I will create new genomic resources (subtracted cDNA libraries) for identifying unknown defense response genes.  My approach is novel in that it uses parallel exposures of three evolutionarily divergent groups of fish (salmonids, Atlantic cod, and zebrafish) to immunogenic stimuli or environmental stress, followed by gene expression studies with DNA microarrays, subtracted libraries, and other genomic techniques.  In addition, the impact of thermal stress during embryonic development will be analyzed for these fish groups.  Bioinformatic methods will be used to compare different species' global gene expression responses to a particular stressor, and to identify the molecular pathways represented by immune- or stress-responsive genes.  Cross-species comparisons of global gene expression results will identify some genes that are part of all fish defense systems, and other genes that act in lineage-specific defense responses.  This research will significantly improve our understanding of how fish protect themselves against pathogens and environmental stress, and will be valuable to several research areas including comparative immunology, evolutionary biology, and aquaculture.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Memorial University of Newfoundland",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Biologie mol�culaire","Biologie mol�culaire"

"To understand how the terrestrial-atmospheric carbon balance may shift in the face of climate change, it is critical to evaluate soil organic matter response to changes in the physical and biologic environment. Laboratory incubations are frequently used to  quantify optimal organic matter decomposition in response to driving factors (typically temperature), but many other factors contribute to the real-world response to climate, vegetation and land use changes.  Of particular importance are the limiting physical factors related to oxygen diffusion rates and soil moisture, which help to protect soil carbon from aerobic decomposition at high latitudes.  Other limiting factors may include compaction, particle aggregation and leaching of labile carbon.  Physically-based field approaches are sorely needed to help establish real-world (rather than theoretical) responses to climate change. 



Methodology is an important dimension in field research.  The proponent has a proven track record in research and development, with existing patents, and new R&D projects that continue to attract external funding and collaborative interest.  These technologies will provide essential contributions to the proposed research.  The research program will tackle the following objectives:

1. Quantify the relative importance of various limiting factors in real-world decomposition dynamics with the help of experimental field plots where controlling / limiting variables can be manipulated.

2. Quantify the relative roles of factors limiting and driving decomposition in real ecosystems, both locally and across different forest types in Atlantic Canada.

3. Continue to integrate new methods and technologies into pure research, with a focus on generating meaningful, unique and novel data products.

"The subject of this proposal is a technology to measure gas emission (flux) from soils, which is a measurement of interest to research, government, and industrial users.  The current industry standard device for measuring these emissions is the 'static chamber' - essentially a small inverted can placed on the soil surface that collects gases emitted from the soil.  Static chambers have been used for 50 years with only incremental improvements, and their problems are well characterized.  Our patent-pending technology holds significant advantages over static chamber technologies and has piqued the interests of Campbell Scientific Canada Corporation, an experienced world-leading CANADIAN company.  A relationship has grown from an initial meeting in late 2008, which has become progressively more serious.  Campbell feels that this technology could become a new industry standard in long-term monitoring of soil gas emissions and would be interested in offering the probe to markets in Canada and worldwide via the Campbell Scientific group of companies.  Campbell has, however, identified technical barriers to commercialization.  In this application, we propose a sound workplan and strategy to address these issues in a timely manner. With appropriate support, both parties are confident that these hurdles will be overcome and a sound and commercially viable product can be moved to market.","Instrumentation technology","St. Francis Xavier University","1 & 2","I2IPJ ","Idea to Innovation","Physique du sol","Science du sol"

"This research proposal involves the study of new functional materials through the incorporation of nanoparticles in polymer matrices.  A variety of systems will be investigated, including nanoparticles composed of inorganic salts, metals, and polymers.  These different particles have been selected because of the variety of interesting properties that they exhibit.  For example, luminescence and magnetic nanoparticles will be prepared.  In order to obtain processable materials from these nanoparticles, they will be embedded in polymer films.  The development of methods to facilitate the dispersion of inorganic and metallic particles in organic media therefore constitutes one of the principal challenges of the work.  To achieve this, several strategies for the introduction of organic coatings onto the surfaces of the different particles are proposed. A second important goal of the research is the development of methods permitting the spatial distribution of the particles to be controlled.  This is important because the proprieties of nanoparticle systems often depend not only on the nature of the constituent particles, but also on the manner in which they are organised.   Several methods of nanoparticle organisation will be considered, including electrostatic assembly on surfaces, magnetic assembly and optical manipulation through the use of photopolymers.

"Genomics is allowing new insights into the nature of gene expression and interaction, and the processes of evolution and adaptation. We can go beyond the classic paradigm that evolution is due to structural differences (amino acid changes), and examine the role that gene regulation (changes of gene expression) plays in evolution and adaptation. In addition, the advent of high-throughput genotyping makes more elaborate population genetic inferences possible.

     We address the hypothesis that adaptation and evolution are functions of molecular networks, and not individual genes, and that evolution can occur via changes of gene regulation within these networks. To this end, we will use the new approach of ""genetical genomics"", which uses genetic variation to the study the genetic determination and evolution of gene expression.

     For our putative networks, we will focus on a large biosynthetic pathway, the phenylpropanoid pathway, which leads to the chemical families of flavonoids (involved with pigmentation and various derivative effects) lignins (involved with wood or cell wall properties). We will mainly use monkeyflower (Mimulus species) as a study system, because of the recent advent of a genome sequence for this plant, as well as several other genomic resources. Mimulus is highly regarded  as a model species for evolutionary studies.

    We will also investigate how higher order coefficients of gene identity can be applied to population genetic inferences. This is a more theoretical investigation that involves new statistical models that sample three genes as a unit from a population, and will be applied to existing datasets in oaks, monkeyflowers and pine. With the advent of highly informative microsatellite markers, and high-throughput SNP assays, inferences about population differentiation and inheritance can attain new levels of power.

"Modern particle theory stands at a crossroads. Recent experimental data has led to a rather precise confirmation of the basic theoretical structure for particle physics - namely the `Standard Model' (SM). However, the tremendous recent advances in cosmology show that, despite its success, there is much that the SM cannot explain on cosmological scales, e.g. dark matter. This contrast, combined with several theoretical inadequacies, leads to an ensuing sense that much more is to come and we look forward to the unveiling of part of this story when the LHC collider begins full operations in 2009. Such a conflicted picture directs us to look both inward, to delve into the primary structures of the SM to better understand its success, and outward, to push the boundaries in energy scale (and precision) seeking the frontier at which new physics will become visible. This dual viewpoint drives the primary goals of my research. 



Understanding gauge field theories, the building blocks of the SM, particularly in more complex regimes can provide insight into where new physics will emerge, and has consistently led to new calculational tools. One component of my research involves utilizing new tools known as `dualities', many of which have emerged recently from string theory, to understand the complex dynamics of QCD - the gauge theory of the strong nuclear interactions - and other less tractable regimes of the SM. The second strand of my proposal is more data-driven and aims to probe the boundaries in energy scale of the SM, searching for new short-distance physics using high precision experiments that test discrete symmetries, which are often indirectly sensitive to scales much higher than are directly achievable at colliders. The main questions to be addressed are: what mechanism determines the relic asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe (which requires new ""CP-violating"" interactions); and also how best to probe the identity of dark matter with precision experiments, either directly in underground labs or indirectly through observations of the galaxy.

"Many Canadians are concerned about the effects of air pollution on their health and on the health of the environment, and that concern tends to be magnified in communities where there are prominent local sources of air pollution.  We have identified 3 Ontario cities with distinctive industrial profiles and significant community concern about the effects of air pollution on their citizens:  Sudbury, Hamilton, and Sarnia.  Moreover, it is clear that the air pollution emitted in these cities is distributed over an immense geobraphical area, so the effects of air pollution generated is of interest to stakeholders well beyond the local areas. 



In this study, we will collect particulate air pollution from Sudbury, Hamilton, and Sarnia and subject it to a detailed chemical analysis; this will allow us to compare the air pollution in these locations with the chemical composition of air pollution collected in other cities and see if there are unique characteristics of local particulate pollution that may be attributable to local industrial sources.  We will also test the effects of the collected particulate air pollution in experimental biological systems to see what kinds of effects are caused by exposure to this type of pollution, and compare it to the effects of pollution from other sources.  



These studies will give us a better understanding of the nature of air pollution in industrial cities in Ontario, the different contributions to local air pollution made by industrial and non-industrial sources, and the potential health effects of exposure.

"This proposal deals with the synthesis of polymeric materials that have the potential to store large quantities of hydrogen for use in environmentally benign hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells. A motivation for this work comes from growing concerns over the negative impact the burning of fossil fuels has on the environment, and the resulting desire to seek alternate, ""green"", sources of energy. In this context, hydrogen-based fuels are promising candidates as the main by-product from energy generation would be water. However storing pure hydrogen (as a liquid or gas) represents a safety hazard, and consequently, alternate, safer, sources of hydrogen are needed.

    )	The proposed study involves the preparation of new polymers that contain amino-borane (AB) groups, -NH2-BH3, as part of polymer's chemical structure. Due to the chemical nature of the amino-borane units, these AB-rich polymers have the potential to release large quantities of pure hydrogen upon heating, or in the presence of various metal catalysts. The use of polymers to chemically store hydrogen has not been explored and represents a new and worthwhile strategy in chemistry. Anticipated advantages of the proposed system include: low cost, the simple preparation and high atmospheric stability of the polymers, a substantial reduction in volatile byproducts during hydrogen release, and the ability to chemically recycle the polymeric fuel source after hydrogen generation. In addition, the light nature of the polymeric arrays should lead to hydrogen storage capacities that approach the U.S. Department of Energy prescribed target of 6 wt% for hydrogen based transportation. 

 This project will also involve studying the fundamental reactivity of amino-borane units and the use of this knowledge to make ultra hard and insulating boron nitride for the electronics industry, where the increasing miniaturization of electrical components requires the design of new materials to keep pace.

"Mon programme de recherche des 5 derni�res ann�es concernait sp�cifiquement le couplage de m�thodes non destructives (ND) pour suivre la progression de la r�action alcalis-granulats (RAG) dans le b�ton. De nouvelles m�thodes ND ont �t� d�velopp�es et valid�es en laboratoire, bas�es notamment sur l'acoustique non lin�aire. Cette nouvelle demande tient compte des acquis pr�c�dents et propose un programme visant l'application sur site de nouvelles m�thodes d'�tudes de la RAG sur des structures de b�ton en service. En effet, passer du laboratoire au terrain n�cessite une logistique diff�rente, de m�me qu'un �quipement adapt�. En outre, les r�sultats obtenus en laboratoire au cours des travaux r�alis�s depuis 2004 tendent � montrer qu'ils ne peuvent �tre transf�rables � l'�chelle de l'ouvrage qu'au prix de nouveaux efforts qui feront l'objet de ce nouveau programme.

1- Identifier une signature propre � la d�gradation associ�e � la RAG;

2- D�terminer le taux de progression de la RAG dans des ouvrages en service;

3- Localiser et quantifier l'endommagement du b�ton dans des ouvrages en service;

"A long-standing problem in metamorphic petrology has been the inability to unequivocally link the P-T estimates of metamorphic rocks (determined by geothermobarometry) to the timing of the metamorphism (determined by geochronology). The problem arises because the minerals generally used for geothermobarometry (e.g., major silicate phases such as garnet, pyroxene, plagioclase) are not the same as those typically used for geochronology (e.g., zircon, monazite, titanite, rutile), and because in conventional dating methods the rock is crushed, thereby destroying the spatial relationships between mineral species and any zoning within them. In the last few years, new analytical approaches have yielded significant advances towards the resolution of this problem. These include: (i) imaging the locations of individual minerals used in geochronology with respect to the various components of the metamorphic fabric and the minerals used in geothermobarometry, (ii) imaging and correlation of zoning patterns of minerals used in geothermobarometry and geochronology, thereby demonstrating contemporaneous growth or dissolution, and (iii) in situ microprobe methods of geochronology by EPMA, LA ICPMS, or ion microprobe that reduce or eliminate the need to crush the rock, thereby retaining important spatial information. We propose to use and develop these methods for application to Precambrian (Grenville, Slave) and Paleozoic (Appalachian) orogens. Coupling the data obtained from studies of this kind with regional structural information provides insight into metamorphic processes, as well as permitting robust reconstructions of the tectonic evolution of the orogenic crust.

"Isoprenoid metabolism provides mechanisms to channel a ubiquitous precursor, isopentenyl pyrophosphate, into the synthesis of a diverse array of natural products. Although all organisms can produce isoprenoids as part of their primary metabolism, plants synthesize a secondary layer of isoprenoids to augment their adaptation fitness. More than 50,000 isoprenoids have been identified, and clear evidence exists that some isoprenoids are of central importance in plant physiology, development, and interactions with other organisms. Plant isoprenoids have been used by humans as pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and industrial products, but the chemical synthesis of these commodities is often difficult due to their structural complexities. To control the isoprenoid metabolism in plants or in other heterologous systems, it is necessary to advance the basic knowledge of isoprenoid biosynthesis. I propose here to study the biochemistry, transport, and carbon-flow of sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) in the plant family Compositae, to which lettuce, sunflower and medicinal plant sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua) belong. Specific emphasis will be given to the biosynthesis of the anti-malarial drug, artemisinin (an SL endoperoxide derivative), in A. annua. The genes responsible for the SL C11,13-double-bond reduction and lactone ring synthesis will be identified and characterized, and the structure-function relationship in the sesquiterpene oxygenase will be analyzed using chimeric cytochrome P450 enzymes. The potential involvement of ATP-Binding Cassette-transporters in sesquiterpenoid transport will be critically evaluated in an engineered yeast system and plants. I will also investigate carbon-flow in the biosynthesis of SLs using sunflower trichomes as a model system. In the trichomes, the coordination of two distinct cell types (photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic) will be studied by labeled precursor-feeding assays, in situ immunolocalization of key enzymes, in situ RNA hybridization, and single-cell-type genomics. The proposed multi-facet analysis will elucidate how the SLs are synthesized and transported in the trichomes of the Compositae and will provide a rationale for SL flux engineering.

"With the convergence of the telecommunication networks towards a common IP technology and wider deployments of wireless access technologies (e.g. Wi-Fi 802.11 and WiMax 802.16), telecommunication infrastructures are exposed to greater security risks than ever before. Paradoxically, the private and public sectors, as well as society as a whole, increasingly rely on these technologies to operate.



The central objective of this research program is to propose new methods that will improve the capability of large telecommunication infrastructures to mitigate the impact of malicious attacks. In the framework of the proposed research program, we will investigate more closely how to integrate security monitoring functionality into the telecommunication equipment (i.e. the IP routers and Ethernet switches), the application servers and, ultimately, the personal end hosts in order to detect large distributed outbreaks of malicious malware. This aim will be achieved by developing ubiquitous sensors distributed across the telecommunication infrastructures which cooperate with each other and are aware of the network topologies.



In the long term, we expect these distributed self-monitoring infrastructures to better detect and react to self-reproducing worms or to large networks of compromised hosts (a.k.a. botnet) flooding targeted services to disrupt them (a.k.a. distributed denial-of service). This novel approach is an alternative to the traditional one, which uses dedicated specialized equipment, such as intrusion detection and prevention systems (a.k.a. IDS and IPS). This equipment generally has only a partial view of the environment, which has the effect of reducing its efficiency, and requiring independent training, deployment and management and to consequently increase their costs.

"The objectives for this project are to establish technologies that can remove contaminants from contaminated waters that might not otherwise be considered treatable.  An important aspect of a sustainable society is its water supply.  The treatment of drinking water to remove unhealthy contaminants is crucial to this goal, as is the removal of contaminants from industrial wastewaters before discharging them to the environment.  

    )	One thrust of the proposed research is the removal of perchlorate and nitrate from drinking water.  Perchlorate is a contaminant that is being found more and more frequently in drinking water sources throughout North America and Europe as a result of contamination from military and industrial activities such as the manufacture and use of rocketry, fireworks, and automobile airbags.  Recent studies also suggest that perchlorate may occur naturally and it has been found in many foods such as lettuce and milk.  Removing perchlorate from agricultural water sources may be important to protect the food sources.  The health effects of perchlorate are related to the function of the thyroid gland, which controls early development and life long metabolic processes.  Recent studies suggest that even very low levels of perchlorate in drinking water correlate with decreased thyroid function in humans.  Nitrate has long been known to cause changes in the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood of infants causing ""blue baby"" syndrome.  Nitrate is typically a co-contaminant with perchlorate.  The development of treatment processes to remove perchlorate and nitrate from contaminated water is imperative to protect the health of Canadian citizens.  

    )	The other thrust of the proposal is the development of technology capable of removing oil contaminants from oil exploration and recovery operations produced water.  Produced water is saline and not amenable to regular biological treatment.  The ability to remove contaminants from this type of waste will greatly aid in the work underway to restore natural environments in Canada exposed to the poor practices of the past and provide a mechanism to prevent further contamination.

"In keeping with previous work in my laboratory, I propose to explore animals' ability to process the dimensions of time, space, and number.  I will continue to examine the question of whether animals have a concept of time and can thus cognitively time travel.  Experiments with black-capped chickadees will look for evidence of episodic memory and its temporal basis, and experiments with rats will look for evidence of future planning.  Cue competition (overshadowing and blocking) will be examined using the peak procedure when the cues signal different fixed time intervals to food reward.  Recent research and theory suggests that humans and animals share a primitive counting process based on magnitude estimation.  I have developed a model of number discrimination based on this process that makes specific quantitative predictions about performance.  The predictions of this model will be tested in a series of experiments with pigeons.  Although recent research indicates that dogs are highly sensitive to human cueing, relatively little is known about their basic cognitive abilities.  I will carry out experiments with dogs to examine their spatial memory, ability to keep track of time, and ability to discriminate between different numbers of events.

"Variation in environmental conditions, such as ambient temperature and oxygen levels, can have dramatic consequences for the operation of the nervous system, which thus endangers animals.  For those animals that actively negotiate their environments this occurs at the point when vital neuronal circuits are impaired, long before cells and tissues suffer direct damage. For example, even marginally impaired operation of the neural circuitry for detecting the rapidly looming approach of predators will increase the risk that an organism fails to escape capture and consumption.  Also it is important to ensure that the neural circuit responsible for providing working muscles with an adequate oxygen supply continues to operate effectively.  My research program is concerned with discovering the mechanisms by which nervous systems fail under extreme conditions and those that allow some animals to continue behaving in the same environment.  We use the African migratory locust as a model system for our studies because these animals are regularly exposed to high temperatures and, in different seasons, the risk of flooding and immersion.  Locusts, and most other insects, have the ability to survive stressful times by entering a coma during which energy is conserved and from which recovery is apparently complete.  Over the next five years we will describe some of the pathways and processes by which this is achieved and investigate how nervous system function is modified for more efficient operation after recovering from the coma.  One idea of general interest to all neuroscientists is that nervous systems are tuned for optimal performance in a process whereby there is a continuous trade-off between high performance and energy conservation.  Also the neural shutdown during the coma is very similar to the processes underlying dysfunctions of the mammalian nervous system including stroke and migraine.  Understanding how neural tissue copes with stress is important at the level of operation but also in consideration of how populations might be affected by climate change; particularly important for pest species such as locusts and grasshoppers.

"There is a continual drive in the semiconductor industry towards higher performance electronic and opto-electronic components for applications in communications and computing and it has been projected that the world-wide market for these components will be about $300 billion annually within 10-15 years.  Key to these gains in market share and higher performance has been the ability to manufacture semiconductor structures at progressively smaller length scales, now approaching a billionth of a metre across.  Structures this small are often prefixed by the term ""nano"" which implies ""one billionth"".  It will be the purpose of this research to contribute to the development of the scientific framework necessary for understanding semiconductor nanostructures and how changes at the atomic level can impact the performance of a complete device.  In order to investigate structures this tiny, highly focused probes of electrons are scanned across the surface of a sample and the electrical currents generated, light produced, and electrons scattered off of and through the sample are measured.  By studying how these electrons interact with unique arrangements of atoms valuable insights can be gained into how semiconductor devices work.  The main outcome of this research will be an increased understanding of the operation of semiconductor devices at the nanolevel that will lead to improved device functionality.  In addition, it is expected that the methodologies developed for characterizing and understanding these semiconductor systems will find cross applications to other nanosystems in the biological, chemical and environmental sciences.  Canada will benefit from this work through training of highly skilled researchers that can contribute to the competitiveness of Canada's telecommunication and technology industries.  Also, from government and industrially-based collaborative work, it is expected that direct benefits can be realized to Canadian companies in the form of technology transfer.","Materials sciences","Acadia University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Semiconducteurs,"Physique de la mati�re condens�e"

"A significant amount of data gets produced as part of software development activities. In addition to numerous deliverables (e.g., source code, test cases), an active development organization will typically generate numerous internal artifacts that contain knowledge about the software under construction. Internal project artifacts can be generated manually (e.g., how-to guides), or automatically (e.g., execution traces). Considered as a whole, the artifacts produced as part of software development activities constitute an important repository of knowledge about a software project. Given the knowledge-intensive nature of software development, effective use of accumulated software project knowledge has the potential to help software development organizations increase their productivity and the quality of their products.



However, in an environment where software artifacts are modified on a daily basis, the consistency between a piece of software project knowledge and the current state of the project is continually at risk. Open-source projects provide plenty of examples of programming systems for which the only tutorial available is out-dated by several versions. Although certain types of information can easily be re-generated (e.g., test coverage data), many types of information can be expensive to generate. In general, systematically ensuring the relevance and correctness of existing software project knowledge is a major challenge.



The goal of this research program is to investigate how we can efficiently maintain and evolve software project knowledge, and to elaborate a set of modeling and traceability techniques that will allow software development organizations to cost-effectively maintain the knowledge they have accumulated about a software project. This program will innovate by focusing on the problem of maintaining the relevance and accuracy of existing knowledge, as opposed to generating additional knowledge (e.g., through data-mining, or static analysis).","Information systems and technology","McGill University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie logiciel","Technologie de l'information"

"Biology tries to explain the origins and consequences of life's variety.  My work contributes to an important debate on the role of environment in the evolution of an organism's features and ultimately how biodiversity arises.  The classical view has the local environment only externally sorting different types, with the more successful surviving better and having more offspring than less successful types.  An alternative view has the local environment also contributing an internal effect that shapes how organisms develop and so influences what different types are available to selection.  These different roles contribute to the debate between 'nature' (genes that evolve) versus 'nurture' (genes that contribute to development) and whose evolutionary potential remains unknown.  Many animal traits have flexible responses to rearing environment but we are just beginning to understand how this flexibility arises, disappears and influences an organism's performance.  My work explores how the 'nature of nurture' (genes that influence developmental responses to environment) influence an individual's performance and either contribute to or limit evolution. My work lies at the intersection of ecology, development and evolution and so will contribute to a wider synthetic understanding of environmental effects in ecology and evolution.  I integrate the classical selective function of the external environment with its potential internal affects on development to explain the unusual varieties of fishes in Canada's postglacial lakes. My work tests the roles of environment in the evolution of diversity though: 1) Lab experiments investigating how developmental responses to rearing in salt versus freshwater affects adaptation in a marine fish that colonize freshwater habitats; 2) Lab experiments assessing how developmental flexibility contributes to the formation of new species in Centrarchid fishes; 3) Field tests of the role of competition in the evolution of different varieties of pumpkinseed sunfish.  These studies will contribute a better understanding of how environment and development interact and contribute to the evolution of important biodiversity.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","University of Guelph",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","�volution et �cologie","�volution et �cologie"

"The development of arithmetic concepts is an essential aspect of children's arithmetic knowledge. In the area of children's mathematical cognition, much of the emphasis has been on the development of additive concepts rather than on multiplicative concepts and yet multiplicative concepts are more complex and difficult for children to understand. Further, research on how children's conceptual development occurs in conjunction with procedural and factual knowledge of arithmetic is critical to understanding children's mathematical knowledge as a whole. My research program aims to address both of these issues by investigating how both additive and multiplicative versions of the concepts of inversion and associativity develop across time in conjunction with procedural and factual knowledge. The concept of inversion, that pairs of operations are inversely related to each other, appears to be grasped, even before formal schooling when the additive aspect of the concept is assessed on problems such as a + b - b. However, when multiplicative problems such as d x e � e are presented, children appear to have a much weaker understanding of the inversion concept. The concept of associativity, that any pair of numbers can be solved first in problems of the form a + b - c and d x e � f, appears to be weak on both additive and multiplicative problem types. There is some evidence that understanding of one concept is related to understanding of the other. Further, there is some evidence that the understanding and application of the concepts is related to factual and procedural knowledge of the operations under investigation. The goal of this research program is to follow children's developing understanding of both concepts and to isolate and identify how concept development can be enhanced or promoted. Children's solid understanding of how the arithmetic operations relate to one another is key to their further and more complex understanding of the mathematic problems and concepts that they will be exposed to in their later years of formal schooling.

"Simulation models that connect animal behavior and population dynamics with spatial data represented in a geographic information system (GIS) are becoming a prominent feature in the fields such as conservation biology and landscape ecology. These models are valued in conservation efforts because of their utility in contrasting management scenarios. However, their validity is limited due to uncertainties concerning landscape data, habitat modeling, as well as parameters representing our understanding of the behavior of dispersing animals. Using an agent-based, object oriented modeling framework for data integration and synthesis, we will explore the interplay between the fuzzy representation of spatial landscape data and their subsequent use in spatially explicit population models (SEPMs). Strategies for an empirically based methodologies for deriving a spatially explicit fuzzy representation of habitat based on archival field data will be developed. The advance in GIS-based habitat representation will be incorporated into a modeling framework allowing exploration of theoretical models of dispersal behavior that will incorporate the anisotropic nature of perceptual range as well as landscape matrix effects on an individual's behavior. This extends recent work that integrates fuzzy representation in the GIS database module with the fuzzy control of animal movement behavior using the concept of Probeable objects. A general model building objective is to be able to explicitly represent the behavioral tradeoffs, or differing decision strategies, that dispersers may use to navigate the landscape. It will advance our understanding of how dispersing animals may behave under different circumstances, thus helping design spatially explicit simulations that plausibly represent both the landscape as species-relevant spatial information and the individual based model of animal movement. The improvements in such a system should advance the quality of ecological intelligence provided to conservation efforts.

"Construction management aims to improve our ability to plan, forecast, control, and evaluate project outcomes, in order to deliver projects that meet their objectives.  Decision support systems are an integral part of construction management; they help construction personnel make better, more informed, and faster decisions to improve project outcomes.  The challenges in developing decision support systems for construction lie in how to model uncertainties that are due to linguistic expression, and how to develop systems that effectively capture engineering judgment, while at the same time making use of valuable project data.  Fuzzy logic is a powerful modeling technique that is specifically designed to handle natural language and approximate reasoning.  This research aims to develop one of the fundamental aspects of fuzzy logic to make it more suited to construction applications.  It uses a technique called neuro-fuzzy modeling to combine fuzzy logic, expert systems, and artificial neural networks to develop two industrially-relevant decision support systems for construction.  Construction bonding is the process by which a bonding company provides a guarantee to a project owner that a contractor will comply with the terms and conditions of a contract.  The risk of contractor default is becoming more significant as projects become more complex, resulting in higher bonding standards and larger premiums for bonds.  This trend has resulted in reduced competition for projects and increased construction costs, which may limit the number of projects that are constructed and compromise essential services such as our physical infrastructure.  This research aims to develop a decision support system to help bonding companies in evaluating the risks in making bonding decisions, to help maintain the availability of bonds to a diversity of contractors at a level that stimulates competition and minimizes construction cost escalation.  Another decision support system will be developed to help contractors to improve and optimize construction labour productivity.  Labour productivity is one of the most significant uncertainties facing a construction project and one of its largest cost components, making it a critical issue to address.","Construction methods","University of Alberta",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie et gestion du b�timent","G�nie civil"

"Polymer-matrix composite materials (PMCs) are characterised by high strength, high stiffness and low mass. These properties make PMCs ideal for airframe construction as mass reduction has a measurable impact on operating costs. Aerospace PMCs are fabricated materials based on carbon fibres: in lower-cost, out-of-autoclave processes these fibres are woven, braided or stitched into fabrics and infused with curable resins such as epoxy. PMCs have been used for making simple, thin, '2D' airframe components for decades. As further weight reductions are sought PMCs are increasingly considered for complex airframe parts. Advances in PMC and textile technologies are needed for reliable, efficient and economical production of PMC parts with complex 3D shapes, thick sections and high fibre content, to predictable performance specifications.

     The aim of this i2i proposal is to demonstrate the commercial viability of an innovative manufacturing technology for carbon fibre reinforcement preforms used in aerospace polymer composite parts. In the proposed programme we will demonstrate a pre-production manufacturing process and equipment for net-shape 3D preforms, that overcome major current challenges facing reinforcement production for PMC part manufacturing. We will produce demonstrator preforms using the manufacturing process and equipment. We will secure a partnership with an end-user in the aerospace industry, leading to a new venture to develop and manufacture 3D carbon fibre preforms and ultimately PMC parts to end-user specifications.

     The industry seeks new ways and methods for decreasing costs, increasing the array of feasible parts, and increasing potential applications of PMCs. The uOttawa Net-Shape 3D Preform technology enables this through improved fabrics, thereby reducing PMC manufacturing costs and providing aircraft manufacturers with increased design possibilities. The uOttawa technology addresses these challenges, offering great potential in moving 3D preform technology to a greater number of applications in aerospace and other markets.

"Transfer of information in the nervous system is mediated primarily by neurons communicating with each other through fast chemical synapses. It is now well established that the release of neurotransmitter at fast chemical synapses is characterized by a high level of plasticity.  That is, that the release of neurotransmitter at a given time is influenced by the previous activity of the synapse.  In the past decade, a large body of evidence has been obtained indicating that glial cells are active, dynamic and involved in close interactions with neurons.  It is now clear that glial cells are sensitive to neuronal activity and synaptic transmission. During the previous funding period, we showed that astrocytes mediate hetero-synaptic plasticity in rat hippocampus, a short-term synaptic plasticity phenomenon. They relay information from inhibitory interneurons, through GABAB receptors, on the glutamatergic presynaptic terminals at the Schaffer collateral synapses.  This proposal is a continuity of this work where the major goal is:

     To Study the Roles of Glial Cells in Hetero-synaptic Plasticity in the CNS.

 By using specific manipulation of neurons and glial cells we will study the interactions between different types of neurons and glial cells to determine their respective contribution in the production and control of the plasticity of synapses. These experiments should demonstrate that glial cells regulate synaptic activity to regulate or even induce synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. This glial regulation could be determined by the type of cells and their unique interactions with the surrounding synapses and neurons. Hence, not only glial cells modulate the transfer of neuronal information in the CNS but they are also involved in the regulation of plasticity events associated with memory in the brain.","Medical and health sciences","Universit� de Montr�al",1,"RGPGP ","Discovery Grants Program - Group",Neurophysiologie,"Biologie animale"

"The recent development in the field of organic electronics and molecular electronics is scientifically rich and technologically very promising. The progress has been observed in many directions, approaches that allow to build supramolecular systems with an excellent architectural control or to grow thin films with a molecular precision, spectroscopic techniques that undoubtly reveal fundamental characteristics of surfaces and interfaces, and the continuous production of devices with improving performance. Although the significant progress observed, the field remains one of the most open and challenging area where a support from computational modeling can be greatly beneficial. A good example is the synthesis of well-ordered discotic crystals that exploits intermolecular hydrogen bonding (HB). Beyond an accurate description of HB, quantum mechanical tools can also be used to reveal many other fundamental properties such as the molecular structure, the stability, the electronic structure and the electron transport of the materials. The impact of such theoretical approach provides the essential elements for the design of electroactive materials. 

The present proposal deals with the formation and stability of organized materials toward a rational development of functional organic nanostructures and their subsequent characterization. The nanostructures of interest would find applications in organic field effect transistors (OFET), organic photovoltaic cells (OPC), and organic light emitting diodes (OLED). We focus on the formation of self-assembled and supramolecular systems that are driven by relatively weak interactions such as HB and p-p dispersion interaction. Our main objective is to propose a general strategy for the creation of well-organized and tightly packed systems where the degree of electron delocalization can be tailored. A second important objective concerns the characterization of nanostructures, especially to describe their electronic structure, electrical transport and photophysical properties. Finally, a long term objective is to describe the influence of semiconducting or metal surfaces on the structural and electronic properties of organic nanostructures.

"With world energy consumption expected to increase by 50% and reaching 733 x 10^20 joules by 2030, there is a strong impetus for the development of clean, renewable energy sources such as solar- and wind-based electricity generation. Due to the non continuous energy generated by these sources, their use strongly relies on energy storage devices with high power and high energy density that will be able to supply electricity during off-hour operation. Electrochemical capacitors (EC) will play an important role in future energy storage due to their ability to store and deliver charge at higher power than batteries.  Although EC based on metal oxide electrodes in particular possess very high specific capacitance which makes them promising storage devices, their energy densities are insufficient to meet future needs. Research on electrolyte interactions with the electrode materials in EC has been identified as a priority area where improvements could lead to significant progress and will be the focus of this research program. We propose the use of protic ionic liquids as replacement of water-based electrolytes in metal oxide EC. These ionic liquids are entirely composed of ions in a liquid state around ambient temperature, possess high thermal and electrochemical stability as well as a high concentration of protons. The proposed research program involves the use of PIL electrolytes in metal oxide capacitors, an idea that my group pioneered. The lack of fundamental understanding on the influence of electrolyte species on molecular interactions will be addressed by studying different ion structures to determine how electrolyte properties influence device performance. A particular attention will be given to the proton transport and activity in the electrolyte through electrochemical and NMR experiments. The effect of these properties on charge storage will be evaluated with several metal oxide electrodes both in half-cells and in prototype devices. The expected outcome and impact of the proposed research will be felt on both the fundamental and applied levels of the science of electrical energy storage, a field that is identified as a priority in Canada and many other countries.","Energy storage and conversion","Universit� de Montr�al",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","�lectrochimie","Chimie physique"
"Slowly but steadily the human population of Canada is moving North for natural resource exploration and development.  For example, in Qu�bec, peat extraction is moving North as the availability of sites in southern Qu�bec is becoming rare. Research on reliable establishment and colonisation of Sphagnum and the return of C sequestration function to the restored habitat (Rochefort 2001) will help to decrease CO2 emissions and get a green landscape after mining. Equally, understanding the factors controlling the productivity of Sphagnum could help in designing large scale production of Sphagnum biomass and alleviate pressure on the environment. In Ontario and Alberta, huge projects to harvest decomposed sedge peat for fuel production or tar sand for petrol production will necessitate the restoration of large fen areas.  Part of this research program will be to understand the regeneration niche of brown mosses to develop an expertise in Canada on the restoration of fens that hopefully will become comparable to the international recognition gained with knowing better the regeneration niche of Sphagnum. With the development of economical activities in the North, a network of communication is often developed for construction (e.g. for building dams) and then reduced or abandoned (e.g. winter road, access road, temporary airstrips, borrow pits for road construction). These structures leave a series of scars in the landscape that take quite a long time to recover. In this program, I will study the factors controlling the dynamics of moss colonization of exposed soil and rock surfaces in harsh environments.

      To fulfill these general objectives, the research approach, will be: 1) fine scale analyses of the production and decomposition functions of restored peatland ecosystems to evaluate the most characteristic function of peatlands: to sequester C on a long term basis. 2)Examinations of soil-plant interactions of disturbed ecosystems. 3) Manipulative experiments to uncover facilitation processes of key disturbed habitats which afterwards should inscrease the success to restore them. 4) A long-term fertilisation experiment to understand better the impact of Snow geese on their breeding arctic sites.

"Units of DNA, genes, are the blueprints that encode for proteins, which are the building blocks and machinery of the cell.  Messenger RNA (mRNA) relays the genetic information from gene to protein.  Not all genes and their corresponding proteins are active in all cells, rather different cells ""express"" a different array of genes and proteins.  The activity of a particular gene can be regulated at the level of mRNA production or at the level of protein production.  It has recently become apparent that new mechanisms involving small RNAs function to regulate gene activity at both the level of mRNA production and mRNA stability.  We are just beginning to understand the various mechanisms by which small RNAs can regulate gene activity.  We have uncovered a role for small RNAs in regulating a cellular process often disrupted in human cancers, the Ras signal transduction pathway.  However, we do not know the target or the mechanism of this small RNA.  Our lab will determine how theses small RNAs regulate Ras signaling, as well as potential identify new proteins important for small RNA function and uncover the potentially novel mechanism by which these small RNAs regulate gene activity.

"The next generation of optical data transmission infrastructure will be based on optical networks that are transparent. Transparent optical networks are beneficial in terms of cost and complexity by avoiding the conversion between the optical and electrical domains at network nodes and the accompanying wideband electrical processing. In this regard, nonlinear optics is a new topic in optical engineering that has a tremendous potential for all-optical signal processing. Nonlinear optics enables light to directly control light and this represents a key feature for transparent systems. The goal of the research program presented in this application is to develop devices based on optically-induced dynamic filter devices. These include optically reconfigurable filters and laser sources based on all-optical dynamic filters. Transparent optical networks require optical filters with properties such as wavelength tunability, passband adjustability, the ability to be switched on and off, with a short time response, all-optical command recognition, small scale and low power consumption. All-optical dynamic filter could also be used in laser sources to enable ultrashort pulse generation in a Q-switch architecture and stable laser operation in a continuous wave emission architecture. This research program involves extensive numerical modeling, device fabrication and testing, and system experiments. The expected contributions in terms of optical filtering would lead to advancement of the state-of-the-art in unique filtering devices for use in broadband optical communications and optical instrumentation. Additionally, the research in terms of lasers sources based on dynamic filtering would enable unique short pulse sources and narrow linewidth sources. Graduate student training is an integral part of these research activities and students will be involved in all aspects of the work. The results that arise from fundamental studies and initial technology demonstrations associated with this proposal will be important for maintaining the international reputation and leadership of Canada in photonics.","Communications technologies (satellites, radar, etc.)","McGill University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Dispositifs photoniques","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"
"Plants and animals often have different morphological, behavioural and physiological traits in different parts of their range. This geographic variation in phenotype is often correlated with variation in ecological conditions, including presence and prevalence of other organisms, and appears to confer populations with improved capacity to exploit or withstand environmental variability. Such adaptive and non-random (with respect to environment) phenotypic variation may arise if different genotypes are selected in different environments (i.e., Darwinian selection), or if given genotypes produce different phenotypes in response to environmental variation (i.e., phenotypic plasticity). Using theoretical approaches, evolutionary biologists have asked what conditions should favour these different evolutionary trajectories, but relatively little empirical research has been done to test their predictions.



The long-term goal of my research program is to develop and test hypotheses to explain ecological and evolutionary mechanisms and consequences of inter-specific interactions involving marine invertebrates. One of my goals over the next 5 years is to elucidate the mechanisms (Darwinian adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, evolution of reaction norms) and constraints (gene flow, genetic and developmental correlations) underlying geographic variation in phenotype of the intertidal snail Littorina obtusata, emphasizing potential contribution of the European green crab Carcinus maenas to this variation. My second short-term goal is to assess the potential impact of this exotic species on an ecologically and economically important marine invertebrate, the American lobster Homarus americanus. In particular, I propose to assess the potential for, and outcome of, competitive and predatory interaction between C. maenas and juvenile H. americanus on lobster nursery grounds.

"Decapod crustaceans, such as American lobster, snow crab and northern shrimp, are an important component of Canadian society and economy; in 2006, lobster alone generated $633,181 million, or 34% of the total landed value of all Canada's wild capture fisheries combined. Sound management of this industry is therefore crucial. One of the more important parameters fisheries scientists rely upon to assess and manage stocks is the age of individuals, which is used to calculate growth and mortality rates, recruitment and productivity. Whereas the age of wild animals can often be determined by examining calcified structures (e.g., bones, scales, otoliths, shells), this method has not been used in decapod crustaceans, due to the presumed loss of all integumental structures at each moult. The research we propose will investigate the potential of a new method for revealing absolute age of individual decapod crustaceans, which is based on observations of growth bands in transverse sections of the eyestalk. The observed growth bands appear different from the micro-scale features previously reported in the shells of various crustaceans. Research is needed to determine if the bands documented in our preliminary work are indicators of age, moult events, or neither.  As a first step in answering this question we will use microscopy to determine the precise location, nature and ontogeny of these bands, as well as their potential presence in other body parts (walking legs, swimmerets, gastric mill) and species (8 total). We will then use the knowledge acquired to perform more direct tests of the age-determination hypothesis, based on i- body size - band count relationships in American lobsters from different latitudes, ii- band counts in known-age decapod crustaceans (obtained via rearing of juvenile lobsters as well as a world search of marine laboratories and aquarium facilities), and iii- additional validation using chemical marking techniques. If these bands are confirmed to be age indicators, the implications for future stock assessments and biological studies of lobsters, crabs, and shrimps, both in Canada and around the world, would be substantial. However, even a reliable indicator of moult number would have considerable value in monitoring crustacean populations.

"Coastal marine habitats and organisms are being compromised at an unprecedented rate by human activities and most effects are going unnoticed because insufficient resources are invested in describing what lives in our oceans. In this project, we propose to develop a tool and monitoring program to assist the management of regions in the Bay of Fundy that have recently been identified as Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas by the supporting organization, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO). This project will test the use of settlement cages (collectors) as a tool for monitoring biodiversity of benthic marine invertebrates and small benthic fishes in rocky subtidal habitats. The collectors offer a method for comparing biodiversity among sites and regions in a standardized way with low impact to the environment.   Identification of species will be based on morphological characteristics and DNA barcoding. Collectors will be used to examine spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity using a spatially nested study design in 5 areas in southwestern New Brunswick, and the relationship of these patterns to physical factors (temperature, salinity, bottom type). The group of species found in the collectors will be compared to those in bottom samples from the sites to calibrate this monitoring tool. A field experiment will quantify the impact of predation on larval settlement and early post-settlement mortality. In addition to generating useful scientific information for the monitoring and management of biodiversity in general, this project will examine settlement patterns of species with particular ecological and/or economical significance, such as the American lobster. The proposed research is expected to provide scientific data that should immediately contribute to DFO's management of Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas in the Bay of Fundy and is expected to result in the development of a standardized tool and protocol DFO will be able to use to continue monitoring biodiversity in these and other significant marine areas in the future.

"This proposal is to purchase an upright bright field Leica DM5000 B microscope equipped with differential interference contrast, fluorescence, digital camera and image analysis software. The system will be used in several research projects combining geological, biological and ecological approaches over the next 3 years to document and understand microalgal communities in various marine ecosystems. The fluorescence microscope allows for detailed studies on the identification, morphology, viability and trophic character (ability to photosynthesize or not) of dinoflagellates and other marine microalgae. One project will focus on dinoflagellates (unicellular protists) and their cysts in Arctic regions. The potential increase of shipping due to the melting of sea ice in the Arctic will be accompanied by increased shipping and intense ballast water intake/exchange, which is necessary to maintain the ships stability. Dinoflagellates and their cysts can survive several weeks in the ballast water and invade new areas when the ballast reservoirs are emptied or flushed. Therefore, we need to document their abundance and distribution in Arctic regions in order to monitor potential invaders and to effectively help developing mitigation measures. Dinoflagellates can produce toxic blooms (e.g. St. Lawrence Estuary in 2008) and cause massive deaths in the fish, bird and marine mammal populations. In the St. Lawrence Estuary, Alexandrium tamarense produces resting cysts that may germinate several months after being formed, lying dormant in the upper sediment layer, and acting as a ""seed bank"" for future toxic blooms. Therefore, we need to document the spatial distribution of the cyst beds within the Estuary/Gulf of St. Lawrence area to help anticipate future bloom episodes. Another project will be providing paleoceanographic reconstructions (temperature, salinity and sea ice cover) for the last 2000 years (with particular emphasis on the pre-industrial/industrial transition) based on dinoflagellate cyst assemblages. This will provide precious data on the oceanic conditions that prevailed prior to the onset of the actual global warming, and contribute to future climate scenarios.

"Global warming caused by the anthropogenic release of greenhouse gases is now a fact, as stated in the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change: ""Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level"". The best example is the extent of Arctic sea ice in 2007, which was the lowest ever recorded. The Arctic ecosystems and northern communities are the most affected by such changes. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop realistic and accurate climate scenarios for decision makers to implement adaptation and mitigation measures. The main objective of our research program is to quantitatively reconstruct the evolution of sea surface conditions throughout the Canadian Arctic for the last 300-400 years (Pre-Industrial/ Industrial Era transition) in order to provide climate modelers with the necessary boundary conditions to test the accuracy of the next generation of regional climate models for the Arctic. The quantitative reconstruction of sea surface temperature, salinity and duration of sea ice cover will be realized at a pluri-annual time resolution using dinoflagellate cyst assemblages as proxy indicators. Plankton (motile dinoflagellate assemblages) and surface sediment samples (dinoflagellate cyst assemblages) will also be analyzed and compared to assess the threat of invasive aquatic species and/or harmful algal outbreak that may result from increasing water temperature and increased shipping traffic through the Northwest Passage following the disappearance of sea ice on a seasonal basis. These results will help decision makers to adapt the Canadian regulation on ship ballast disposal and mitigation.

"Since the beginning of the twentieth century, mathematics has undergone various stages of specialization.  This specialization process led to a phenomenal development in many different directions.  This explosion of knowledge makes it essentially impossible nowadays for an individual to have detailed understanding of all the research done in mathematics.  This does not mean that there is no possibility of interaction between two distinct areas of specializations.  On the contrary, such interactions are very important and desirable as they contribute to the circulation of new ideas and often lead to surprising relationships.

The proposed research intends to help to develop this kind of interactions, since it concerns index theory, which is a subject establishing an important bridge between analysis and geometry, two central area of research in mathematics.  More precisely, index theory study the space of solutions of certain linear partial differential equations on a curved space, in fact their index, which is an analytical quantity, and try to express it in terms of the geometry of the curved space.  The equations studied arises in various context in mathematical physics, for instance in general relativity or in string theory.  They have been studied extensively in cases where the curved space is bounded (like a sphere or a torus).  However, in cases where the curved space is unbounded, that is, is infinitely large, much less is known, the behavior at infinity of the equation having a very subtle influence on the index.      

The proposed research intends to focus on these sort of unbounded situations as they arise naturally in geometry and in mathematical physics.  The goal is to develop ways to compute the index and to relate it with the geometry of the underlying curved space, leading in this way to new relationships between analysis and geometry.  This in in turn should lead to interesting consequences in both domains, as well as in mathematical physics, where analysis and geometry play an important r�le.

"Networks are pervasive in our world. From migrating birds flying in formation, to social groups, wireless networks, world-wide web, the examples are endless. In particular, the area of control systems, which is the focus of this proposal, offers an important potential to understand, analyze, design and control networks that are self-organizing and fully autonomous.  For these multi-agent networks, recent demands on performance and reliability have caused control engineers to move from the design of a single centralized controller to the design of several localized controllers. In this approach, each agent has a dedicated controller that shares information with controllers from other agents using the communication network. One of the main advantages of networked control with decentralized capabilities is that in case of one controller having a fault, the decentralized architecture of the network offers reliability to the system whereas if a single centralized controller fails it will put the entire system into jeopardy. 



The goal of the applicant's research is to develop a general-purpose computer-aided methodology for analyzing and designing networked piecewise-affine systems with decentralized sensing and control capabilities. Applications will focus on networks of formation flight simulators using the flight simulator laboratory developed by the applicant at Concordia University (courtesy of Mechtronix Inc.), and formation flight of micro air vehicles (MAVs) in collaboration with Defence Canada.

"Local movement and long-distance dispersal (LDD) influence many important ecological processes. However, progress in understanding animal movement has been hampered by the lack of an integrative modelling framework for guiding the collection and interpretation of empirical data and providing adequate fits to them. Recent work has shown that in many cases L�vy-stable motions (LSM), a class of random-walk models, are a powerful alternative to classic diffusion models. LSM also have desirable mathematical properties and have close connections with foraging theory, which shows that under many conditions LSM provide an optimal search strategy. These attributes make LSM an appealing conceptual framework for studying movement.

  The general objective of the proposed research is to test the usefulness of the LSM model for characterizing individual movement behaviours and linking individual variation in movement to population-level patterns in the field. The central hypotheses to be tested are that: (i) leptokurtosis and heavy tails in dispersal kernels can be accounted for without invoking effects of intrapopulation or environmental heterogeneity, (ii) small-scale movement of individuals can be extrapolated to predict population-level redistribution and LDD at larger spatial and temporal scales, and (iii) individual movement behaviour is consistent with an optimal search strategy for intermittent foragers. Stream fish will be used as a study system because their movement can be conveniently modeled along a single spatial dimension.

  The proposed research will provide rigorous field tests of the LSM model's ability to connect local movements to LDD, project from short-term individual behaviour to population spread, and generate insight on searching behaviour and population heterogeneity in stream fish. Demonstration of improved performance relative to current models should encourage the application of the LSM model to other organisms and environmental contexts, including its use as a management tool for evaluating the role of LDD in population persistence, access to critical habitats, colonization by invasive species, and the spread of disease.

"Numerous ubiquitous, durable materials such as glass and ceramics consist of three-dimensional network of main group elements such as oxygen, silicon and boron and aluminum. Mono-dimensional household materials (polymers) such as the silicone caulks or sealants are also based on main group frameworks. Mono- and three-dimensional materials based on main group elements have also found a variety of less known, high-tech applications. Small-molecular compounds with a main group framework however, although of great fundamental interest and intensively studied, have found fewer practical applications so far. 

The research proposed here targets the synthesis and characterization of novel small-molecular compounds with a main group framework, as well as the investigation of their applicability as catalyst components, polymers and constituents in electronic devices. The majority of the proposed research concerns the replacement of carbon in materials with known applications with related main group fragments, targeting the improvement and fine tuning of the useful properties of these materials. 

The outcomes of the proposed research can be classified in three categories: training of highly qualified personnel, potential economically relevant applications, and advancement in the fundamental knowledge of the main group elements. The graduate and undergraduate students working on the proposed topics will become proficient in advanced synthetic and analytic techniques, perfect their problem solving skills and become familiar with the specific of chemical research. Their training will enable them to obtain positions in the chemical industry and the areas affiliated with oil and gas extraction and processing, environmental chemistry, semiconductors and microelectronics, and others. The preliminary results obtained so far indicate that the derivatives described within this proposal could have an economically relevant impact in selected areas of catalysis and material sciences. Last but not least, the proposed research will bring a significant advancement in the general knowledge of inorganic materials and main group chemistry in general.

"Interpretation of the effects of variation in genes is among the most challenging and important problems to be addressed in deciphering the sequences of complete genomes. My laboratory has developed bioinformatic theory, software, and applications to understand and predict the consequences of DNA sequence changes. This framework uses information theory to relate differences between the strengths of interactions between proteins and DNA or RNA to their effects on gene expression. Information theory can be used to detect and quantify signals in DNA or RNA that are recognized and bound by proteins in the cell. This project will develop and evaluate mathematical models for the natural cellular process to identify elemental protein-coding units of genes, termed exons, from the sequences of unprocessed RNA transcripts.  Correct processing of these transcripts is called mRNA splicing. We will use information theory to define these signals, and then combine multiple signals within individual exons to distinguish and quantify correctly processed mRNA transcripts from potential decoys. The predictions will be compared with published sequence databases of expressed genes to determine the accuracy of these models.  The models, methods, and software developed  in this will be useful for predicting gene expression patterns in humans and other species. These resources will eventually be used in studies of common sequence variants that are predicted to affect normal mRNA splicing.","Modelling and mathematical simulation of natural processes","University of Western Ontario",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Analyse du g�nome","G�n�tique"

"The proposed research project is directed towards improving the current design and detailing provisions in Canada for structural steel connections. ADF Group Inc., representing steel fabricators in this country, and their engineers (DPHV) have expressed concern with respect to the existing design procedures and potential performance of shear tab beam connections. Similarly, a more cost effective and ductile configuration, as well as corresponding design approach, is sought for slotted HSS brace connections. Shear tabs are commonly used throughout Canada to connect structural steel beams to column or girder members. The current design procedure recommended by the Canadian Institute of Steel Construction (CISC, 2006) is limited to relatively small configurations with a single row of bolts. The design procedure does not address the use of multiple rows of bolts, heavily loaded connections, extended shear plate connections, combined axial and shear forces in the connection, nor the typical weld retrofit measures taken when bolt holes do not align. Slotted HSS brace connections are prone to fracture under the repeated inelastic cyclic deformations associated with seismic loading. At present, in order to account for this failure mode fabricators must reinforce these connections, which adds significant cost. A revised connection is needed that provides for enhanced inelastic performance without reinforcement. The overall objective of this proposed research project is to develop improved design and detailing guidelines for shear tabs and slotted HSS connections. This will be achieved through the completion of an extensive program of tests, finite element analyses and design evaluation. With this information the steel industry in general, fabricators and engineers such as DPHV will be able to more accurately and cost effectively design and construct shear tab and slotted HSS connections. This will place ADF and the steel industry in an advantageous position compared with competing structural materials. Ultimately, the improved design procedures and level of performance of these connections will be of benefit with respect to the safety of building occupants and owners.","Structural engineering","McGill University",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Structures en acier","G�nie des structures"

"Over 600,000 cancer patients a year are treated by radiation in North America. A critical aspect of each treatment is the accurate delivery of a known dose of radiation to the tumour. Thus clinical dosimetry, the determination of the radiation dose delivered to the tumour and elsewhere in the patient, plays a central role in these treatments. This research program involves two separate components of clinical dosimetry.  One goal is to improve our ability to measure the radiation dose in a water tank with a high degree of accuracy since this calibrates the output of the source of radiation which may be an accelerator or a small radioactive seed.  Another goal is to improve our ability to take a knowledge of that ""reference dose"", and calculate the dose distribution inside a real patient exposed to the same source of radiation.  The central tool used in this research program is a suite of computer codes developed by the principal investigator and colleagues. These codes use what are called Monte Carlo techniques to model the passage of radiation through matter, including measuring devices and patients. This research is supported by a powerful cluster of computers funded by CFI. These computer codes are used to study how the instruments which measure radiation are working and recent breakthroughs mean practical and accurate corrections can be calculated for the first time, thereby improving clinical radiation measurement. The results show problems with current methods at the 1 to 5% level, but since the errors can affect hundreds of thousands of patients, the effects can be important.  In another component of the research program, use will be made of another breakthrough to rapidly calculate the dose distributions around radioactive sources placed in the body to kill tumours. Sophisticated techniques have been developed to do accurate calculations of the very complex sources used, while the time taken for the calculations has been reduced from days to minutes. The goal now is to make the programs easier to use so that clinical physicists can make use of them on a routine basis and thereby improve cancer radiotherapy.

"Wireless communications devices now allow us to get information anywhere anytime.  This technology, often used in consumer applications, can improve our lives by keeping us in touch with others.  In the future, wireless devices can also be used to improve the quality of our health care.  Medical sensors can be embedded in the body, ingested, or simply placed on the surface of the skin from where they relay vital information over a wireless link.  Researching this technology will provide the advantage of medical care with less invasive, lower risk procedures.  



Since it is often impractical for an embedded or ingestible sensor to operate from a conventional battery power source, these applications will require innovative low power radios that are self-powered.  New biomedical applications are going to pose challenges both at the circuit and the system level for the radio design.  New radio architectures will need to be developed to handle progressively challenging requirements.  As well, innovation at the circuit level will be needed to implement architectures with extremely low size, and power requirements.  Thus, a broad understanding of issues at all levels of radio design, from device to system architecture will need to be applied.  It will be the goal of this research project to first fully understand all these issues at the circuit and system levels, and then use that understanding to realize new approaches to allow wireless sensors to be used to improve the quality of health care for all Canadians.","Biomedical engineering","Carleton University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Circuits int�gr�s","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"

"The long-term objective of this new research program is to develop a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the relationship between molecular and supramolecular structures and the macroscopic properties of self-assembled low molecular weight organogelators (i.e., compounds which gel oil).  Self-assembled low molecular weight organogelators are becoming a more feasible alternative to fat crystal networks to structure lipid food products, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.  In order to predict which compounds may be utilized as organogels, we must first understand the basic mechanisms of self assembly.  Within the first phase of this program (2009-2014) the effects of solvent polarity on the crystallization kinetics and fibre morphology of a model organogelator (12HSA) will be examined, systematic modification the position and nature of the secondary functional group within modified fatty acids will be used to probe the molecular considerations required for organogelation.  Outcomes from this program are aimed in the long term to reduce trans and saturated fats in foods containing structured lipids.  Fundamental knowledge gained from this program will be transitioned into the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and petroleum areas for nano-structured controlled delivery systems.  This research directly benefits Canadian consumers along with food and pharmaceutical industries.  Extensive fundamental knowledge of organogels, self assembly and advanced instruments used in the field of nano-technology will prepare HQP for careers in academia, government or industry.","Agriculture and primary food production","University of Saskatchewan",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Chimie alimentaire et analyse","Science et technologie de l'alimentation"

"Surfaces dynamically contact each other in many mechanical systems such as: meshing gears, ball bearings, loosely supported pipes and tubes (such as nuclear steam generators and fuel assemblies), and automotive brakes and belts/pulleys, where local intermittent contact can lead to fatigue and surface wear. A few other important applications of contact dynamics include: collision detection for remote teleoperation control and training software for robotic systems and remotely-operated vehicles, the dynamics of sports equipment, such as for golf and baseball, tires and even running shoes.  

   Finite element or multi-body simulation of the transient dynamics of complex mechanical equipment often cannot model complex contact interactions in great detail in order to have reasonable solution durations. Especially difficult is stick-slip behaviour, where forced interactions between local elasticity and friction causes components to intermittently slide and stop.  Problems such as disk brake squeal result from this. Transitions from sticking to slipping are typically gradual, as a growing portion of the apparent contact area slips; this is called partial-slip.  Oblique impact of an elastic body against an elastic support can also exhibit partial-slip, as well as tangential force reversal.  

   The wear and cracking of tubes, such as in nuclear steam generators, concerns both the designers and the operators.  Software (e.g., INDAP and VIBIC) developed to simulate the dynamic response of tubes with loose supports currently does not have partial-slip friction or surface tangential flexibility models.  Adaptation of a new partial-slip model should remove the discontinuity when the sliding force changes direction.  Fundamental work is proposed for new partial-slip models: (1) for rough surfaces, (2) that include radial shear stress distributions, (3) allow for a new contact annulus when the normal load increases with constant tangential load, and (4) to find the shape of the stick zone for elliptical contacts. Improved understanding of partial-slip and the development of new models will help the design of a wide range of systems involving dynamic contact.

"Adaptation is a genetic process of evolutionary change driven by natural selection resulting in organisms that are well suited to their environment.  Two of the most predominant environmental parameters in nature, temperature and photoperiod, play a central role in the adaptation of seasonal timing, temperature tolerance, metabolic activity, and growth in many organisms. Recent climatic shifts are hypothesized to have led to heritable changes in these physiological traits for several species, but the debate over the target of selection continues. Some argue that the evolution of temperature tolerance will predict the biological response to climate change, while others argue that changes in seasonal timing are driving adaptation. Understanding the genes that control these traits and the role of selection in nature is needed to predict how organisms will evolve in response to environmental changes induced by global climate change. 



We will use populations of a small fish, the threespine stickleback, to test these questions. We will test the hypothesis that adaptation to environmental change along a latitudinal gradient is due to genetic changes underlying physiological differences in temperature tolerance and seasonal timing. Molecular methods (genetic mapping and gene expression) will be used to isolate and study the genes that control these traits. We will examine if changes in climate along a latitudinal gradient have left a signature of natural selection on the genomes of locally adapted populations, learning what genes and traits have been the target of natural selection during adaptation to these environments. This research will have a broad significance towards understanding the fundamental evolutionary process of adaptation. Achieving these objectives will lead to better predictions of how organisms evolve in response to rapid environmental changes in nature.

"Blending of plastic and rubber with a cross-linking or grafting agent to manufacture new modified polymers such as TPVs (thermoplastic vulcanizates) and grafted polymers, by reactive extrusion, is a highly non-linear and complex process. High degree of complexity is mainly due to the chemical reactivity and selectivity, sensitivity to the equipment configuration, as well as the processing conditions. From the process control point of view, the reactive extrusion represents a  multi-variable  non-linear  system. A simple control algorithm, such as a PID (proportional, integral and differential) controller is  not sufficient for controlling such a highly non-linear process.  At Lambton College, the unique Advanced Material Engineering Research (AMER) laboratory is equipped with a pilot scale extrusion equipment. In addition to this laboratory, the Advanced Process Control and Simulation (APCS) Research laboratory offers real-time instrumentation and distributed control system (DCS), which are ideal for implementing advanced control methodologies. 

The main objective of this research is to develop new functionalized polymers (e.g. TPVs, grafted polymers) from various commercially available LANXESS' polymers. In order to achieve this objective, a comprehensive reaction and process analysis will be required in order to ascertain optimal operating conditions. Understanding of rheological properties, as well as the flow characteristics through the extruder will be of utmost importance. Thus, simulation and analysis of the twin-screw extruder, by means of rheological and flow models will be performed. In addition, advanced process control methodologies and mathematical modeling of the extrusion process will be developed to automate and optimize the  process.

"Anodization of titanium foils and thin films will be conducted using a two-electrode electrochemical cell with a

platinum foil as cathode at a constant potential. A third electrode may have to be used as a reference electrode

to eliminate noise effect when measuring the cell potential by potentiostat. Foils will be anodized at voltage

ranging from 10 to 40 V, in a dilute [0.5-1 wt %] HF or KF aqueous solution at room temperature in order to

create self-ordered titania nanotube arrays. Annealing at 480-600 �C in a hydrocarbon flame forms

carbon-doped titania and promotes crystallinity of the nanotube arrays to rutile or anatase phase as well as

narrowing the band gap energy. Nitrogen and sulfur doping of titania nanotube arrays will also be studied by

addition of N and S bearing ions such as HNO3, KNO3, NaNO3, NH4NO3 or dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]

into the anodization electrolyte solution.

The doped nanotube arrays will be used as the photoanodes in photoelectron- chemical cells. Upon exposing to

visible light, oxygen is evolved from the photoanode. Platinum electrode will be used as cathode at which

hydrogen is evolved. The photoelectrolysis energy conversion efficiency (ECE) is expected to improve as the

length of nanotube arrays is increased and their geometry improved. Alternatively, the titania nanotube arrays

can be sensitized with a specific dye [ruthenium based dye]. When the titania nanotube electrode is illuminated,

electrons are released and current passes in the circuit.

The outcome of this research has huge potential and benefit for Canada. Once the efficiency of the hydrogen

production is satisfactorily increased, the process can be linked to a fuel cell or a bio-fuel cell to produce

energy in a distributed fashion. On the other hand, the produced doped nanotube arrays can be used in

photovoltaic cells to produce electricity for small opto-electric devices and in photo-oxidation of organic

compounds in water purification plants.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","University of Western Ontario",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","G�nie chimique","G�nie chimique"
"Chirality is a major concern in the modern pharmaceutical, food and agricultural industries. The sale of chiral drugs is close to one-third of all drug sales worldwide. Ordinary chemical production methods for chiral drugs produce a racemic mixture containing enantiomers having identical chemical compositions but different structural orientations in space. It is quite common to find that one isomeric form has a therapeutic effect on the human body while its enantiomer is harmful or ineffective. Hence, there is obvious benefit from separating the two enantiomers to enhance drug's safety and tolerability. The importance of chirally pure drugs has risen dramatically in recent years due to new FDA regulations requiring that chiral drugs be as pure as possible containing a single pure enantiomer. 

The present research initiative aims to develop reliable, efficient and economic separation routes for industry not only in the early development step of new pharmaceuticals but also in large-scale preparation stage. Specifically, two approaches will be explored: (a) crystallization via diastereomeric salt formation, and (b) hybrid simulated moving bed (SMB) and crystallization process. In the latter approach, a SMB will be used first for enantiomer enrichment beyond the eutectic composition of the SLE diagram followed by direct crystallization to recover pure single enantiomers. Another unique feature of this research work will be to apply the concept of multi-objective optimization in the innovative design and development of the two processes. At current stage it is difficult to foretell which process approach will be cost-effective as SMB requires costly chiral stationary phase while crystallization of diastereomeric salts consumes expensive resolving agent. The techniques to be developed in this research will be generic and could be applied to most chiral systems in the various industries such as food, pharmaceuticals and agricultural. This research would lead to a successful clean and cost-effective processing technology that would create value-added products in the rapidly changing global economy.

"The research program focuses on furthering our understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for complex fluid flow.  A major goal of the research is to develop theoretical and numerical tools capable of incorporating a broad range of fluid particle interactions, that can also be used to estimate transport coefficients in continuum flow models, as well as to detect the breakdown of the continuum assumption. To achieve this goal, a stochastic phase-space description and a corresponding particle-based numerical model will be developed.

This work is motivated in part by the controversy concerning the existence of a yield stress transport coefficient for blood, that is generally believed to exist due to red blood cell interaction (aggregation) at low shear rates.  An experimentally obtained value for the yield stress depends on the extrapolation procedure used and on the experimental geometry,  leading to a wide range of reported values that is too large to be meaningful.  The research program allows for the incorporation of more complicated particle interactions, whose effects on the flow properties in various flow geometries will be explored.

Having a broad range of applications, the methods will be used to: 1) assess the effect of geometry on the flow properties of fluids, 2) to assess and appropriately quantify the reactive mechanism for aggregating systems with  realistic reaction rates (eg. constant versus velocity- or shear-rate dependent reaction rates), and 3) to explore the breakdown of the continuum assumption as a result of particle interaction or flow geometry.



The novel methods in this research program will lead to significant contributions that will benefit various industries across Canada.

"Kidney cancer is the sixth most frequently diagnosed malignancy overall, and is responsible for 2.6% of cancer-related death in Canada. In 2007, 4,900 Canadians were diagnosed with kidney cancer and 1,650 succumbed to it. The most commonly recruited procedure for kidney cancer is laparoscopic radical nephrectomy, which involves removal of the entire kidney; however, an alternative to this is laparoscopic partial nephrectomy which allows removal of only the segment of kidney containing the tumour. Unfortunately, this is a technically challenging operation with the potential for serious complications. This procedure can be performed manually or with robotic assistance. Challenges remain in visualizing the critical anatomy hidden from the laparoscopy camera. The long-term objective of this research is to develop the technology to incorporate ultrasound imaging into robotic assisted laparoscopy for real-time guidance. In particular, this grant will develop novel techniques for the acquisition and analysis of ultrasound images to improve the accuracy, speed and success of robotic partial nephrectomies for cancer treatment. Direct benefits to patients include reduction of positive surgical margins, preservation of vital structures from injury and increased patient survival. The techniques will use multiple types of ultrasound images taken before and during surgery. Robotic laparoscopic surgery for nephrectomy is currently guided by a stereo camera system, so incorporation of ultrasound and computed tomography, along with key anatomical information, will provide enhanced guidance for the surgeon. This new approach will enable more accurate visualization of the locations of tumours, blood vessels, nerves and solid organs. The tools developed in this research will be applicable to other groups performing robotic laparoscopic surgery as well as standard laparoscopic surgery. Key research areas include image registration, elastography, data fusion and surgical user interfaces. Seven highly qualified personnel will be trained in these areas over the period of this project.

"In biotechnology, it is required to produce large amounts of active proteins to be used in the preparation of vaccines, in the design of novel therapeutic drugs, and in numerous industrial applications.  Cells possess a mechanism ensuring that proteins can reach the exterior environment only after having attained their correct and active tridimensional structure.  Therefore, it is mandatory to understand the mechanisms by which proteins acquire their proper structure in order to be able to manipulate microorganisms and cultured cells for the purpose of producing large amounts of industrially important proteins.  In the cell, a family of accessory proteins, designated molecular chaperones, aid proteins to reach their proper conformation.  Two prime examples of molecular chaperones are calnexin and BiP.  These chaperones also impede the escape of proteins with abnormal structure, playing then the role of quality control elements.   

For a number of years, our laboratory has been using the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as model organism to investigating how chaperones help proteins to be correctly folded and secreted.  The advantage of using this yeast is that it resembles very closely to the cells of mammals, however Schizosaccharomyces pombe lends itself to easy and rapid methods of manipulation and study.  In this project, we wish to modify the chaperones calnexin and BiP to obtain new clues regarding the way they work in protein folding and secretion.  Moreover, our studies should result in the isolation of Schizosaccharomyces pombe strains capable of producing large amounts of useful proteins, at very low cost.  Consequently, the biotechnology industry will benefit from the outcome our research.

"Our physical universe is modelled as a 3-dimensional geometric object called a 3-manifold, analogous to 2-D surfaces.  Unlike surfaces, classifying the possible types of 3-manifolds is still an open and challenging problem.



Much of the information on 3-manifolds is encoded in algebra, for example the so-called fundamental group.  Despite spectacular recent progress, such as the solution of the Poincare conjecture, which identifies the only 3-manifold which has trivial fundamental group, many open questions and mysteries remain in 3-D topology regarding manifolds and objects in them such as knots and surfaces.



This proposal is to study the deep connection between 3-D topology and the algebraic constructions which reflect their shapes and structures within them.

"As an organism grows, patterns of gene expression emerge which are instrumental in shaping a variety of organs and structures. Interactions between gene expression and morphology are complex and little understood. Part of the problem lies in a lack of methods for assessing tissue growth and patterning quantitatively.  Leaves provide a particularly interesting system for investigating the relationships between growth and patterning, as vein pattern formation and leaf growth are closely coupled, and the plant hormone auxin plays a major role in both processes.  

This proposal aims at investigating the link between auxin transport, growth and vein pattern formation in a quantitative way. First, I will investigate spacing mechanisms leading to vein formation as leaves grow, using vein pattern analysis software I developed. Second, I will investigate the generality of patterning mechanisms between species, and between leaves and petals, in three model species. Third, I will develop a method for monitoring leaf growth during the vein patterning phase of leaf development, which will make it possible to test the interactions between vein patterning and growth quantitatively. Fourth, I will investigate the effect of auxin flow direction on cell polarity and growth using plant cell cultures.  

This work will bring new insights in vein pattern formation and growth processes, and will provide a strong basis for exploring pattern formation mechanisms using simulation modeling. We believe that the combined use of computational and experimental work will be a key instrument for understanding mechanisms of plant morphogenesis. Potential applications include horticulture and crop amelioration, as plant vasculature is closely related to plant morphology and biomass. We also believe this research will have a major impact in the field of developmental biology as a whole, as it represents one of the first attempts to investigate the relations between growth and pattern formation. Domains of application outside plant biology include cancer biology (control of tumor morphogenesis).

"Petroleum is the world's most-traded energy commodity. As such, Canadian consumers are exposed to fluctuations in energy pricing, world energy supply, and to the growing global perception that future energy demand will be dictated by the harsh realities of limited resources and high prices[1]. The International Energy Agency (IEA) suggests that world energy demand could grow 55 % by 2030, and potentially double by 2050. It also indicates a continuing reliance of fossil fuel use through to 2030[2]. On average, about one-third of the original oil in place is recovered by primary depletion and waterflooding, leaving two-thirds, or twice as much oil as is produced, in the ground after secondary recovery [3]. The remaining oil can be categorized into: residual oil in the regions swept by water and movable oil in the regions unswept or poorly swept by water [4]. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes involve injecting a gas or fluids into the reservoir to reduce oil viscosity and/or surface tension in order to mobilize and recover the oil left behind in the ground. 

The overall goal of the proposed project is twofold, first, to engineer chemical delivery systems for EOR flooding using cyclodextrine-polymer systems and start polymers. The initiative is to produce control delivery systems that allow manipulating the release of chemicals at specific targeted areas within the reservoir to recover oil. The second objective is the establishment of strategic injection schemes to allow the placement of EOR chemicals in target zones within the rock formation. The anticipated significance of the proposed research activities is the generation of polymer-surfactant systems for EOR applications and the development of novel approaches for the application of EOR treatments that will increase oil recovery efficiency and ensure the optimization of the elevated costs commonly associated to EOR processes.

"This proposal outlines research to investigate and model the physical crack growth processes that lead to failure in a ""hybrid"" structure under fatigue loading. A hybrid structure is defined here as a metal structure that has been reinforced or repaired using a bonded composite material.  This composite ""reinforcement"" (for an uncracked metal structure) or ""patch"" (in the case of a cracked metal structure) is typically a multi-layer boron/epoxy or other high stiffness fiber-reinforced material. Significant potential exists for the use of hybrid structures for a variety of applications (e.g. aircraft, ships, pressure vessels, biomedical implants, vehicle structures, spacecraft, etc.), however their use for reliability-critical components is extremely limited as accurate analytical tools for reliably predicting failure do not currently exist.  It is due to a lack of basic knowledge of the multiple and interacting failure process mechanisms within the hybrid structure (required for the creation of an accurate failure/life prediction model for structural integrity assessment) that limits their widespread use.  This research will utilize knowledge, facilities and expertise previously developed at UBC to construct and test small-scale specimens to investigate the mechanisms and interaction between hybrid structure geometry, fatigue crack growth and disbonding rate in order to properly identify and model the failure mechanisms. The information obtained will be used to create a crack growth model for hybrid structures, required for development of a new risk/reliability analysis strategy for these complex structures. This new strategy - the HOLolistic Structural Integrity Process (HOLSIP) - will be developed with a specific focus on the application of bonded composite repairs for metal aircraft structures. The goal is to develop the necessary knowledge and prediction models to overcome existing barriers to the certification of this technology for repairing civilian aircraft structures. This research is crucial to obtaining economic benefit from the life-extension programs for the vast fleets of ageing civilian aircraft that currently exist, and will be increasing in the future due to reductions in aircraft purchases after the events of 9/11.

"The proposal requests funds for the pre-research stage of a ""Super B factory"". This is an international particle physics facility that would provide data of a fundamental scientific nature from the annihilation of  electrons and positrons (i.e. anti-electrons) at a centre-of-mass energy of 10.58GeV (an energy equivalent to the mass of approximately 10 protons). The new technologies to be developed will have these collisions occur at 100 times the rates currently available and provide for the detection and measurement of the collision events. With such a data sample, we will study b- and c-quarks and tau leptons with extremely high precision and search for evidence of new physics through studies of matter and antimatter asymmetries and decays of particles that are predicted in theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. The project is in the early planning stages and the proposal will support the planning of this cutting edge research and would enable Canada to play important roles in the project as it develops.

"This grant proposal is a request for the research and development of a detector which will measure the properties of particles produced in electron-positron collisions at a proposed new high energy physics facility known as the SuperB Flavour Factory. This facility will produce 100 times the data of existing facilities designed to probe what is known as the 'flavour sector' of subatomic physics. Such a precision frontier facility will open an exciting window on new energy scales beyond the reach of existing colliders, including CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and illuminate and help explain new physics discovered at LHC, by virtue of quantum corrections which are sensitive to very massive, and as yet undiscovered, particles. These hypothesized particles manifest themselves in precision measurements of rare processes. They also reveal themselves via the presence of processes that are forbidden within our current understanding of physics. The SuperB project is an international effort spearheaded by the Italian INFN funding agency and is expected to start data collection in 2015. To meet such an aggressive timeline, R&D efforts from the international high energy physics community are required now for the preparation of the Technical Design Report which will serve as the detailed blue-print for the project. The R&D that we propose as a Canadian contribution of this effort will solve technological challenges to making precision measurements of the trajectories and specific ionization energy loss of charged particles in a new high-intensity experimental environment. A significant component of the request is for stipends to support graduate students who will work on these problems.

"My research focuses on the creation and analysis of theoretical models that describe structure and dynamics in complex condensed systems (polymeric fluids, colloidal suspensions, zeolites) using the tools of statistical mechanics.  A common goal of these projects is to combine fairly rigorous formal approaches with numerical work to make detailed predictions of experimentally measurable quantities (such as diffusion rates, light and X-ray scattering patterns, thermodynamic quantities, etc.).  The specific topics to be studied are: 

1) Transport in channeled minerals called zeolites that are used in catalysis, in filtration, and perhaps most importantly, are being considered as possible hydrogen storage devices, something that would have profound impact on the greenhouse gas problem and on the energy crisis in general.  Here our focus will be on the role of quantum mechanics in the transport of material into and out of the zeolite and to see how increased concentration, ionic interactions and molecular shape change the energetics and rate of transport.  

2) Equilibrium structure in polymer/poly-electrolyte colloidal suspensions will be examined in order see the effects of chemical equilibrium on the individual polymer monomers, as well as to see how the structure and stability of the suspension is changed when dissimilar diblock polymers are used. 

3) Pattern formation and rheology in sheared colloidal suspensions will be examined within the context of the continuum mechanics models developed in our group.  In addition, our new methodology used for imaging flows within biological cells will be extended to allow for the direct measurement of shearing motions.

4) A new, but somewhat controversial, fundamental identity describing the behavior of complex systems arbitrarily far from equilibrium, the so-called Jarzynski equality, will be critically examined in order to see just how fundamental and useful it really is.  In particular, the role of nonlinear fluctuation phenomena will be studied.

"The loss of integrity or reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the knee can also alter joint stability and dynamics and lead to higher risk and incidence of osteoarthritis (OA).  However, direct non-invasive in-vivo quantification of joint contact mechanics within the joint structures has been limited. Consequently, characteristics of normal healthy joint mechanics, and those leading to pathological conditions are not well established. Further, the optimal criteria and treatments for reconstruction of joint structures to re-establish pre-injury joint mechanics are also lacking. The overall research goals are to understand relations amongst joint mechanics, joint health status, joint injury and repair mechanisms, and the development of degenerative changes associated with ligament injury and repair. Two main hypotheses will be tested:  (H1) Joint malalignment, ACL deficiency and reconstruction result in perturbed joint mechanics, and (H2) an optimal geometry and dynamic control exists for an ACL reconstruction surgery that re-establishes normal knee joint kinematics and kinetics. Knee joint contact and tissue characteristics will be imaged and quantified for 4 in-vivo groups: healthy, OA, ACL deficient and ACL reconstructed under various knee flexion and loading conditions. Using novel image registration techniques, normative ranges for tissue characteristics will be developed. Joint dynamic stability will be assessed for each group using 3D motion analysis, linked to MR images of joint structure using common reference markers, EMG and helical axis analysis. A 3D knee joint model over a dynamic range of motion will be constructed including. subject specific bony segments, skeletal muscles, and passive tissues. Kinematic and kinetic relationships between structures will be established using principles of multibody dynamics and optimization. The validated 3D numerical model will be applied to evaluate the influence of ligament reconstruction variables on joint dynamics and function. This research will generate a more comprehensive understanding of changes in joint mechanics due to compromises of knee structure, thus enhancing our ability to design effective diagnoses, treatments and devices for joint health.","Biomedical engineering","University of Calgary",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie m�canique","G�nie m�canique"

"Cottonwoods are Populus species that are adapted to riparian (floodplain) zones throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Interspecific hybrids occur naturally in zones where species overlap and are also artificially produced to create hybrid poplars, the fastest-growing trees in Canada.  Due to the impacts of river damming and diversion and other human influences, cottonwood populations have collapsed across western North America.  I propose to further investigate the ecophysiology of riparian cottonwoods and their conservation.  Investigations will involve three overlapping areas, hydraulics, hormones and hybridization.  Studies of hydraulics will investigate water fluxes linking streams, riparian substrates, roots, shoots and the atmosphere.  Aspects of tree water relations will investigate hydraulic conductance and vulnerabilities to xylem cavitation, air embolism in the xylem vessels that destroys the capacity to conduct water. The studies will compare and contrast the four Canadian cottonwood species, study differences between males and females, and will also investigate naturally occurring Populus hybrids from the complex hybrid zone in southwestern Alberta, and artificial intersectional hybrids.  The studies will investigate the physiological processes responsible for adaptation to differing environments and we have identified some 'survivors', trees that have persisted after chronic stress and may be uniquely drought-adapted.  Plant hormones studies will investigate the roles of the hormone gibberellin (GA) in the coordination of cottonwood growth responses to changing environmental conditions and studies will also investigate consequences of transgenic modification of GA level and action.  These investigations will (1) reveal ecophysiological adaptations of cottonwoods and poplars, (2) contribute to the restoration of native cottonwoods through river regulation and water management, and (3) identify heritable physiological traits that may enable the development of drought-adapted hybrid poplars.

"When amorphous silicon melts, the liquid is a high-density, metallic, 6-fold coordinated liquid instead of a low-density, covalent, 4-fold coordinated semiconductor. This is even true under nanosecond pulsed laser melting. Does it still hold at the sub-picosecond time scale ? And what does that have to do with MeV ion beams and x-rays ? Read my proposal and discover that the passage of a single, multi-MeV heavy ion can melt amorphous silicon in well under a ps. But what is the nature of the liquid and the subsequent solidification, and how can one answer these questions experimentally?



You will also read about high-resolution radial distribution functions of amorphous materials made by ion beams and of nano-crystals deformed by ion beams. And I will propose a method to count point defects in silicon, to improve over the current method which is 30 years old and has a 50% uncertainty.

"The neutrophil is the first and most abundant leukocyte to be delivered to a site of inflammation or infection.  Neutrophils are equipped with an antimicrobial arsenal that destroys invading pathogens.  However, many pathogens have devised strategies to avoid killing by neutrophils.  Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) or group A Streptococcus (GAS), a gram-positive bacterium, is one of them.  S. pyogenes can cause a variety of human diseases, including pharyngitis (strep throat), cellulites, impetigo, and the potentially fatal necrotizing fascitis (flesh eating disease) and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.  My long-term objective is to understand how S. pyogenes evades killing by neutrophils.  My general hypothesis is that exotoxins secreted by S. pyogenes interact with protein components of the neutrophil defense machineries to prevent killing of the microorganism.  My specific hypothesis is that a novel protein named sic (streptococcal inhibitor of complement), which is secreted by S. pyogenes, targets specific proteins in neutrophils which regulate its ability to ingest microorganisms (phagocytosis) or secrete microbicidal enzymes.  Our specific objectives are to (i) identify and characterize the specific targets of sic in neutrophils and (ii) to analyze the molecular interactions between sic and its protein targets, and examine the molecular effect of sic on secretion and phagocytosis.  We will use a combination of modern methodologies in cellular and molecular biology, immunology and biochemistry to pursue our goals, including mass spectrometry, yeast-two hybrid analysis, protein expression and  purification, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and immunoelectron and confocal microscopy.  These investigations will allow us to elucidate the functional significance of the molecular interactions between sic and its protein targets in neutrophils.  Thus, our studies will advance our knowledge of S. pyogenes mechanisms that evolved to prevent its destruction by neutrophils.

"Atmospheric Chemistry:

    Atomic bromine and atomic chlorine are implicated in a range of chemical processes that take place in the atmosphere, one of the most publicized ones being ozone depletion.  In order to assist in the quantitative understanding of such processes, we are engaged in a research program that seeks to measure parameters that could help in determining the relative importance of reactions of organic compounds with atomic bromine and chlorine in controlling the concentrations of these atomic species in the atmosphere.  This has implications for predicting related atmospheric phenomena such as ozone depletion events.

    Our experiments allow us to selectively produce the reactions of interest under simulated atmospheric conditions in a 70 Litre reaction vessel.  The atomic bromine and chlorine are produced by using light with a spectrum similar to that of the sun to break apart molecular bromine and molecular chlorine.  The extent of reaction with the organic compounds is determined by chemical analysis of the mixture in the reaction vessel and this information allows us to characterize the reactions of a wide range of substances.  The results obtained permit predictions of reactivity based on molecular structure.

Generation and Reactivity of Soot:

    Our research in this area is focused on the high temperature reactions of hydrocarbons that take place during petroleum refining and during combustion of fossil fuels.  The work requires chemical analysis of the product yields under high temperature reaction conditions combined with computer modeling of the very large set of chemical reactions required to describe the overall chemical process being studied.  This work is expected to aid in identifying new technologies for using fossil fuels.  In this way, the research will contribute to the development of processes for using natural gas and petroleum in more environmentally friendly ways.  The results will also provide information on the role of soot particles in atmospheric chemistry.

"The goal of my research program is to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of meiosis.  In the current proposal I will determine gene functions involved in the establishment of the meiotic recombination pattern in Caenorhabditis elegans.  C. elegans provides many unique advantages for my research program.  There is normally only one crossover per autosome making it possible to determine where that crossover occurred and how frequently in a population of events.  The pattern is eliminated in the mutant, Rec-1, and altered in mutants in chromatin modifiers.  A large body of research exists on the molecular components of meiosis; however the basis of the meiotic recombination pattern is not understood.  Although meiotic crossing over can happen between any two nucleotide pairs, there are regions of the chromosome where it occurs preferentially.  Thus, the frequency of crossing over per length of DNA differs from region to region, as much as ten-fold for certain regions of the C. elegans autosomes.  Distribution of meiotic exchange results in an apparent clustering of meiotic markers.  The Rec-1 mutant, which eliminates the pattern, demonstrates that it is subject to evolutionary selection, and responds to molecular determinants encoded genetically. In collaboration with Dr. Steven Jones of the Michael Smith BC Genome Sequencing Center, we have the entire genomic sequence of Rec-1.  Using the genomic sequence we can identify the molecular change responsible for the phenotype and characterize the nature of the pathways involved.     

  

The proposed work will further my NSERC-supported research program directed towards understanding this evolutionarily-conserved and fundamentally-important biological process.

"Knowledge of why depleted fish stocks are not all recovering as anticipated is crucial to future management of fisheries. Recent research indicates that depleted stocks may exhibit different growth and reproduction patterns than healthy stocks. Some depleted stocks have responded quickly to protection from fishing, in accordance with their historical performance, while others have not. The reasons for these differences are thought to be of great importance for better understanding and prediction of stock rebuilding. To date, most predictions, based on faulty ecological assumptions, have proved groundless. This research proposes to use a comparative approach to identify, quantify and model the factors that influence growth and reproduction (productivity) in depleted fish stocks. The focus will be on the depleted cod stocks of Newfoundland and Labrador, some of which are reproducing and growing at near-historical rates, and some of which show poor or no productivity. Comparisons will be used as the basis for testing alternative ideas about why adjacent and depleted stocks respond differently. It is expected that the modeling aspects will lead to new insights into how the life history strategies evident among the various groups are related to population responses under depleted conditions. Comparisons will also be drawn to other regions where similar situations exist.

"Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are pre-fabricated chips that can be programmed to perform any digital hardware function.  They reduce the time it takes to manufacture an integrated circuit from months to seconds and the cost of a prototype from millions of dollars to under $1000. They play an essential role in the wireless, automotive, consumer and industrial markets, with total FPGA annual sales approaching $5 Billion. They enable essentially all hardware development including the emulation of high-volume processors and ASICs, and as the key technology for medium-volume systems. 



Our recent research has shown that there is a huge gap between the area-efficiency, speed and power consumption of FPGAs compared to the more expensive alternative of fully-fabricated integrated circuits.  The long term goal of this research is to raise FPGA capabilities to the point where they replace essentially all of the custom silicon being manufactured today.  This will happen if 1) The performance, density and power consumption of these devices is brought closer to that of full-fabrication chips, and 2) Computers can be effectively deployed on FPGAs (using soft processors which are processor built on the FPGA fabric).



To achieve the first goal we will explore new FPGA architectures, focusing on heterogeneous architectures which mix the efficiency of full-fabrication silicon with the programmability of an FPGA. This effort will require new CAD algorithms and architectural description capabilities in our world-renowned FPGA architecture exploration software.  To achieve the second goal we will continue our work in soft processor architecture, expanding it to look at highly data parallel vector architectures, and will build a soft-processor-based desktop computer to enable the exploration of full systems with soft processors.

"A scanning probe microscope (SPM) is a system commonly used in Nanotechnology research to study the properties of surfaces and interfaces at the atomic and molecular scale. Since its invention, the SPM has undergone a series of transformations that continuously improved its reliability and applicability. In particular, adding modulation capability allows for a considerable increase in the diversity of systems to be probed. A typical SPM system is composed of a ""microscope"" and a ""controller"". The microscope contains a ""tool"" used to probe the sample (typically a sharp tip), an electric/mechanical device able to control both the position of the tip with respect to the sample (usually a piezoelectric scanner) and a system that controls the interaction between tip and sample. The controller is a set of electronic modules that generate the signals necessary for the operation of the microscope, and can be regarded as an interface between the user and the experiment. Thus the whole versatility of the SPM system depends on the capabilities offered by the controller. 

In the SPM Lab at INRS, the JEOL 4500 UHV-STM/AFM/SEM system is an SPM equipped with an SEM column that allows in situ visualization of the tip in interaction zone with the sample under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Unfortunately the experience of JEOL in the fabrication of SPM systems is relatively new and their SPM controller lacks the versatility offered by other manufacturers. 

In particular, RHK Technology and Nanonis (recently acquired by SPECS) offer SPM controllers that are highly versatile (advertised as ""future-proof""), leaving the user to truly control every parameter that governs SPM operation.

"Electronic and optoelectronic organic materials are promising for new generation technologies, including electronic paper, low power-consumption displays, foldable solar cells, chemical and bio-sensors, etc. Although it is in principle possible to fabricate all-organic electronic devices, presently and in the near future organic semiconductors have to be used in conjunction with inorganic materials (for which there is a well-developed industrial infrastructure). Optimizing the properties of inorganic component dielectrics for better compatibility with organics is particularly important for the immediate technological implementation of organic transistor devices. The goal of our proposal is to apply currently available plasma-based technologies (specifically, plasma etching and deposition) to optimize oxide substrate properties (adhesion, wettability, functionalization, etc.) for the development of new electronic/optoelectronic devices. We will design and fabricate hybrid organic-inorganic transistor-type devices, including high permittivity field-effect transistors and light emitting transistors. These devices are based on combining organic molecular and polymer semiconductors with metal electrodes on oxide dielectric substrates. While the transport and light-emission functions of these devices are based on the properties of the organic semiconductors, inorganic components play an extremely important role and ultimately determine the efficiency of the working device. Using plasma modification techniques, we will tune surface chemistry, dielectric permeability, breakdown voltage, etc., so as to improve the charge-transport properties as well as light-emitting efficiency of transistor-type devices (OTFTs and OLETs).

"The access to Energy vectors (ideally renewable and sustainable) is humanity's greatest challenge in the 21st century. Succeeding in addressing this challenge is the only hope of ensuring prosperity for our modern society. Hydrocarbons (e.g. oil, natural gas) are currently the most widely used Energy vectors, yet their continued use poses enormous problems as they are inherently not renewable as well as highly pollutant, therefore not sustainable. In particular, world oil consumption is constantly on the rise, while production is dwindling, and this causes continuous oil price increases. Therefore the development of renewable energy sources will enable global economic growth, minimizing impact of these human activities on the environment. One further problem that needs an urgent solution is finding new and efficient ways of transporting and storing energy. Methanol production has been indicated as a way of solving at once all these problems. Methanol can be produced from synthetic gas (syngas), which in turn can be produced by a large variety of sources, like biomasses, waste and natural gas. This proposal addresses the problem of developing novel and more efficient nano-catalysts for methanol production. By exploiting recent nanotechnology breakthrough concepts, we plan to synthesize core-shell metal clusters with custom designed reactivity, so as to optimize the synthesis of methanol. We will design metallic components and cluster structure from first principles, thus obtaining a fine-tuning of the catalyst's chemical reactivity, which will allow to maximize the Turn Over Number for the industrially and economically relevant catalytic reaction of methanol synthesis. This project will be carried out in collaboration with ENERKEM, a Canadian company that manufactures catalysts. Our approach is likely to

"Nanostructured surfaces and interfaces are interesting model systems because of their unusual, often unexpected properties. A more profound knowledge of such systems holds the promise of optimizing for example the physical properties of semiconductor devices, and could be the key to master other promising technologies. Moreover, the ability to control structural synthesis on the nanometer length scale will lead to the development of new functional materials with unprecedented physical and chemical properties.

Given the undeniable scientific and technological interest in strengthening research and training in Nanoscale Science and Technology in Canada, I am leading at INRS-EMT a vigorous research program on the growth, processing and characterization of advanced nanostructured materials.

This program will contribute to (i) a better understanding of the adsorption and self-assembly properties of organic molecules at surfaces, the physical and chemical mechanisms involved in semiconductor crystal growth, understanding and optimizing the properties of biocompatible materials, functionalizing semiconductor surfaces for biosensing applications; (ii) foster focused research activities in advanced materials processing and characterization at the nanometer length scale, consistently with specific needs of the high technology Canadian industry, and (iii) train highly qualified personnel to respond to the scientific and technological challenges of our modern society.

"Wireless technologies enabling cellular mobile telephony and wireless Internet access have proliferated to an extent that they are integral parts of our society. Exciting networking paradigms such as wireless ad hoc networks and wireless sensor networks have  been studied in significant detail. However, the commercial success of these paradigms has been slow to materialize. Part of the reason for this could be identified as the lack of a well-defined ""killer application"". The automotive sector may be all set to change that. Automotive wireless networks are at the threshold of a significant growth opportunity. Advances in enabling technologies such as wireless communications, coupled with application areas such as active safety for automobiles, infotainement, remote maintenance and reliable manufacturing, leave automotive wireless networks poised to become the ""killer application"" for wireless ad hoc and sensor networking. Our proposal pertains to the field known as vehicular communications but also to the field of intra-vehicle communications with the design of under-the-hood sensor networks. These two areas are related in that the data collected by the sensor network has to be processed and sent to either a controller belonging to the above-mentioned infrastructure or to the neighboring vehicles if, for example, safety is at stake. 

More precisely, our proposal is aimed at designing a secure and efficient communication architecture and the corresponding protocols and algorithms to enable the above-mentioned automotive applications.

We will start our project with the following preliminary list of potential application areas:

   1.    )	V2V and V2I communications for active safety;

"We are establishing new methods for making molecules in which the presence of either silicon or phosphorus will render them useful in a range of practical applications. The methodology we are developing is concerned with how, where, and to what effect these heteroatoms (non-carbon atoms) are incorporated in the molecules. Our major research goals include the following:

(A) We are interested in the manufacture of polymer materials containing long chains of silicon atoms.  Unlike the pure silicon found in microchips, these polymers have organic, carbon-based side-chains attached to each silicon, which make them soluble.  If the polysilicon chains can be prevented from twisting, through our proposed modifications to incorporate cyclic substructures, they will conduct electrons, behaving as ""molecular wires"". Such processable, conducting materials are of enormous interest to the microelectronics industry. A critical part of the methods we are developing involves the study of metal catalysts whose primary function is to bring two silicon-containing molecules together and join them, in such a way that the resulting, two-silicon fragments can then easily be incorporated into ring structures or long chains (as described above). Our elaboration of the catalyst mechanism will permit the controlled synthesis of new, reactive molecules with highly specific structures.

(B) We are also developing new catalysts for the preparation of phosphorus-containing molecules that act as ligands for metals, binding strongly to metal atoms through the phosphorus heteroatom. These ligands impart stability, solubility and ""shape"" to the resulting metal complexes, whose chemical reactivity can be directed through controlled variation of the ligand structure. The challenge in this project is learning how the catalyst can best join together two halves of a new ligand molecule, so that we can precisely control its resulting shape. The products of this project will find use in the fine chemicals and pharmaceueticals industries.

"Nearly every atom in the Universe heavier than helium was forged in the core of a massive star, which upon its death, released those elements back into the interstellar medium (ISM).  Once there, the process of star formation incorporates those atoms into the next generation of stars and planets.  While the lives and deaths of stars are well understood, very little is known about how gas moves from one generation of stars into the next.  The proposal research will unravel the origins and evolution of the molecular clouds, which host all contemporary star formation in the Universe.  There are numerous, detailed observations of these massive clouds and many researchers aim to model their behavior using numerical simulations.  Broad insight will be gained by making a well-posed comparison between these simulations and observations.  While such comparisons have been made in the past, it is the detailed and systematic approach that sets this project apart.  By modeling the effects of telescopes on the acquisition of data, we will produce simulated observations that can be compared directly to real observations.  The project will amass a set of simulated observations in collaboration with researchers studying cloud evolution.  These simulated observations will be compared to newly acquired data from the James Clark Maxwell Telescope's new Legacy Surveys as well as archived projects by the investigators.  The project will use novel approaches for a statistical comparison of the data adapted from other scientific fields to find those simulations that best match sets of observations.  By identifying the simulations that best mimic reality and isolating the key physical ingredients that are responsible for those simulations' behavior, it will be possible to identify the essential physical processes that govern molecular cloud evolution.  Insight into these processes will provide a key link in understanding the evolution of galaxies from the Big Bang to the present.

"Large composite panels and composite skins are now commonly used in aircraft structures. Such assemblies are lightweight and resistant, but they do not provide sufficient sound isolation or vibration damping. High vibration levels and cabin noise must be reduced both in helicopters and airplanes to meet new incoming vibration and noise regulations. 



The purpose of this project is to develop a new technology that will integrate damping elements inside composite aircraft structures from their initial design phase. The general objective is to develop low-vibration and low-noise composite panels that will satisfy aeronautics industry requirements. Composite panels will be embedded with viscoelastic damping elements. The use of viscoelastic materials has proved to be efficient for the damping of traditional engineering structures. This know-how will be transposed to composite structures.



Product development will include materials testing, numerical modeling and dynamic response simulations, manufacturing procedures development, prototyping, and experimental testing of the product. The dynamic performance of the resulting panels will be evaluated against those of a non-treated composite panel. The main outputs of the research will be in the form of (1) small-scale flat panel prototypes, (2) a damped panel performance analysis report, (3) damped panel design guidelines, and (4) damped panel manufacturing procedures.

"Les moteurs � combustion interne sont grandement utilis�s pour propulser les v�hicules r�cr�atifs tels que les motoneiges, motomarines, et v�hicules tout-terrain (VTT). Les fortes explosions dans ces moteurs engendrent des vibrations importantes dans le v�hicule.

"Tactile sensation is encoded in the primary somatosensory cortex in topographical maps accordingly to the body surface. This topographical representation can be modified as the result of training and experience. This brain plasticity results from newly expressed or strengthened synaptic connections. The effect can be measured in humans noninvasively using magnetoencephalography (MEG) as increased activation or larger activated area on the cortical surface. Brain plasticity is an important factor for successful recovery from a stroke. We shall develop a new method for objectively monitoring of plastic reorganization in somatosensory cortex by measuring the size of the somatotopic hand area as indicated by the distance between finger representation. The finger representation in human somatosensory cortex can be localized with the MEG. The distance between fingers can be obtained from multiple MEG recordings with stimulating one finger after the other. However, head movements between recordings cause too large errors. With our new procedure we will stimulate multiple fingers at the same time with vibrations of different rate. We shall record brain activity at the frequencies of the vibration stimuli and can separate the responses from each finger. Those responses will be localized. The distance between finger representation can be measured with high precision because all recordings were done at the same time and were affected by head movements equally. We shall investigate the possible interactions between finger localizations and effects of attention in order to optimize the procedure. In summary we shall develop a highly precise method for measuring distances between body part representations in the cortex. Changes over time in the obtained distance measure indicate plastic reorganisation e.g. as the effect of therapeutic intervention.

"N-3 (omega-3) fatty acids are important constituents of the cell membrane which are found in high amounts in fatty fish. The cell membrane is a fatty layer which covers and protect the cell and its internal components.  N-3 fatty acids can change how the cell functions and have been found to be useful in maintaining and improving health. They are also an important component of the rapidly growing nutriceutical and naturalproducts sector. How they exert their effects is however unclear. In addition it appears that different types of n-3 fatty acids including DHA and EPA act differently.  This project will consider how various different n-3 fatty acids change the way the cell builds, changes and replaces the membrane and how cells communicate.  In initial experiments this will be accomplished by growing cells in the laboratory in the presence or absence of various types of n-3 fatty acids. The effect these treatments have on how the cell changes its membrane will then be analysed. This will involve measuring the uptake of fatty acids into the cell, as well as the activity of the enzymes which carry out this process.  This information will then be extended using an in vivo model.  Different types of n-3 fatty acids will be fed to rats to determine how they effect the cell membrane.  In addition, their effect upon how different cells communicate using fatty acid derived chemicals will be studied including their role in modulating blood flow and the inflammatory cascade.  This work will significantly advance our knowledge of how n-3 fatty acids interact with the cells of the body and how we might utilise these effects to change the way cells function. Such information is vital to understanding the role of these fatty acids in the functioning of the body and to advancing their role both as important dietary components and nutriceutical products.  As such this work will likely help improve the validity and accuracy of the dietary advice give to Canadians.  Furthermore the information gained will help guide the commercial development of omega-3 fatty acids by the important and growing nutriceutical industry.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Lakehead University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Lipides,Biochimie

"MOTIVATION: La formation et l'accumulation de glace sur des structures telles que les �oliennes, le r�seau �lectrique, les bateaux, les avions et les �quipements radar et de communication entra�nent des interruptions de service et des probl�mes de s�curit�. Un usage accru d'�oliennes pour la production d'�lectricit� contribue � r�duire l'�mission de gaz � effet de serre mais son efficacit� est r�duite par l'accumulation de glace sur les pales et autres composantes. Des processus complexes tels que la nucl�ation, l'adh�sion, la coh�sion et la croissance contribuent � l'accr�tion de la glace. On ne peut agir sur les deux premiers ph�nom�nes.

Les surfaces seront caract�ris�es � l'aide techniques puissantes telles que la microscopie � force atomique, la spectroscopie des photo�lectrons x, la microscopie � balayage, l'hyst�r�sis de l'angle de contact, l'analyse nucl�aire et l'adh�rence de la glace.

"THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE of this proposal is to take advantage of the enormous possibilities of the interaction of ion beams with matter for the development of efficient Si-based light source and of surface treatments which can be used on various materials. The short term and sub-objectives are: 1) Investigation of growth and luminescence properties of silicon nanocrystals (Si-nc), 2) Optimisation of optical gain in Si-nc/SiO2 layers, 3) Fabrication of a Si laser prototype, 4) Study of ion beam matter interaction, especially for isolating materials, 5) Adjustment of the surface/interface properties such as wetting, adherence and work function by formation of nanostructured surfaces

PHOTO- AND ELECTRO-LUMINESCENCE OF Si-nc: The development of an all-Si technology will considerable simplify the integration of the optoelectronic devices. The principal milestones are: 1) Validation and optimisation of our computer code used for the simulation of the light interference effect on the PL spectra, 2) Modulation of the PL and EL spectra by light interference and double implantation, 3) Determination of the optical and light emission properties of the Si-nc/SiO2 layer as a function of depth, 4) Specification of the Si-nc/SiO2 layer composition leading to an improvement of the optical gain, 5) Optimisation of the current injection efficiency for EL, 6) Construction of a simple optoelectronic device such as a Si laser prototype.

MODIFICATION OF SURFACE PROPERTIES: Many problems related to surface phenomena such as formation and accumulation of fog, ice, dust and dirtiness, require efficient and durable surface treatment. The principal milestones are: 1) Ageing control of superhydrophilic surfaces by double implantation and/or chemical passivation and/or nanostructuration of the surfaces, 2) Production of superhydrophobic nanostructured surfaces, 3) Determination of surface molecular composition that reduces adhesion of ice and dirtiness, 4) Optimisation of the processes leading to the adjustment of the surface work function with nanostructured surfaces, 5) Increase of photovoltaic cell efficiency by using Si-nc and nanostructured surfaces.

"NATURE OF THE WORK TO BE DONE. Diatremes are volcanic pipes filled by debris; their surface expressions are called maars. Kimberlites, which often contain diamonds, have many similarities with non-kimberlitic maar-diatreme systems. Canada is now known to host numerous kimberlites and is rapidly becoming a major player in the diamond industry. The research program will combine field studies of very well-exposed relatively fresh diatreme deposits, innovative laboratory experiments, and careful volcanological investigations of diamondiferous kimberlite pipes.

WHY THE RESEARCH IS IMPORTANT & ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES. The fact that diatremes are subterranean features explains why their eruptive processes are poorly understood relative to those of other volcanoes: these processes not directly observable! The ambitious three-pronged approach proposed here will produce a much improved understanding of the deposits and eruptive processes of maar-diatreme volcanoes and kimberlites. This will allow us to develop much more realistic models for the origin of Canadian kimberlites. This information will then be integrated in better designed and more efficient exploration models to be used by the mineral industry.

HOW THE RESEARCH FIELD AND CANADA WILL BENEFIT. The scientific benefits will be fundamental progress in our understanding of the eruptive processes of maar-diatreme volcanoes and kimberlites. Canada's resource sector, which contributes significantly to our economy, faces many challenges, including the attainment of critical mass in the scientific research and exploration expertise for new commodities such as diamonds. This research program will build this local expertise and contribute to training of highly qualified personnel. In addition, results will be integrated in better designed and more efficient exploration models to be used by the private sector.

"Hydrogen Molecule

One area of my research is the study of excited states of molecular hydrogen (H2).  Hydrogen is the most common and the ""simplest"" neutral molecule in the universe.  Emission of light from hydrogen molecules is found from the space between stars (the interstellar medium), from the atmospheres of the outer planets, including in their aurora, and also on the edge of fusion plasmas in tokamaks.  Understanding of excited states of hydrogen is therefore crucial to understand these observations and to model what is happening in those locals.  Excited states of hydrogen are also important as a testbed for theoretical treatments of molecular dynamics.  Because hydrogen is in principle ""simple"" it is possible to do very precise theoretical calculations on it and to compare the theoretical results with the results of experiment.  This comparison allows us to understand what fundamental processes are at work and how they lead to the experimental results.  My contribution is the theoretical calculations of properties of the excited states.



Flexible Molecules

Not all molecules are rigid objects.  In fact the flexibility of bio-molecules is crucial to their function.  Studying flexible molecules is the other main area of my research.  This basic theoretical work seeks to understand the dynamics of flexibility in molecules, in particular how this flexibility interacts with rotational motion, and what the consequences are of a molecule having two flexible portions.

"Acoustics opens a window revealing an underwater world. Light cannot reach the oceans' depths, so often the only way to ""see"" something at a distance is through the observation of reflected sound waves rather than light waves. For nearly three quarters of a century oceanographers have used sonar technology to learn about the ocean interior. This powerful tool does, however, have some limitations. It is difficult to distinguish between different sources of scatter. This makes it tricky to apply quantitative data analysis to determine concentrations of fish or plankton, or the amount of mixing between interacting ocean currents. These are not purely academic goals, as acoustic surveys are used to help make predictions of fish and zooplankton stocks and thus impact marine policy decisions. Being able to quantitatively measure the mixing of ocean currents using acoustics will dramatically increase our ability to make this type of measurement; the dearth of mixing information is one of the major factors hampering the reliability of climate and climate change models.



The work proposed here is multifaceted. The crux of it, however, is that we will study how small-scale oceanic fluid flows interact with sound and zooplankton with the aim of improving acoustical surveying in the ocean. We will employ innovative techniques, such as broadband acoustics (akin to moving from ""black-and-white"" to ""full-colour"" acoustics) to help discriminate sources of sound scatter and a brand-new type of oceanographic profiler able to make coincident video observations of zooplankton and measurements of the small-scale flow field to determine whether plankton behaviour affects their bio-acoustical signature.

"This research program is made of two distinct subprograms: the computation of capacity and the classification of the automorphisms of the spectral ball.



CAPACITY is a central notion in potential theory with many important applications in complex analysis, approximation theory and number theory. Computing the capacity of a general compact set is a very hard problem. However, the recent algorithm developed by Ransford and myself offers a practical way of computing the logarithmic capacity of a large class of compact subsets of the plane. One of the main objective of this research program is to exploit, extend and improve this new method. Here is a short list of projects.

1- To extend the algorithm to other capacities, for example, Riesz capacities, weighted capacities (in R^n).

2- To relax the hypotheses under which the algorithm converges, especially HCP.

3- To enhance the performance of the algorithm by exploiting the special form of the linear programs involved.

4- To test the strong isoperimetric inequality for counterexamples in the case of disconnected sets.

5- To improve the precision on the capacity of special sets, for example the Cantor set.

6- To develop a software for automatic computation of capacity.



The classification of the AUTOMORPHISMS OF THE SPECTRAL UNIT BALL of M_n is still unfinished, 17 years after the Ransford-White conjecture was stated. Although recent progress have been made, the conjecture is still open even in the case n=2. We suggest an experimental approach to some of the underlying questions. Moreover, we would like to exploit the reformulation of the problem in the theory of cohomology.

The problem of understanding the automorphisms of the spectral ball arises from the spectral Nevanlinna-Pick problem. This one in turn comes from a question of robust stability in the field of control theory.

"One of the most important questions in petroleum exploration is: how do geologists today locate hydrocarbon pools that were created millions of years in the past? To answer that question requires obtaining a detailed understanding of current, and past, fluid-migration patterns in geologic basins. Thus, the long-term goal of the proposed research program is to improve petroleum exploration efficiency by gaining a better understanding of the subsurface flow of formation fluids (oil, water, gas).



Over the next five years, the research program seeks to use the Williston Basin as a natural laboratory to answer four questions: 1) What are the distributions of fluid pressure (hence flow directions, rates) and water chemistry in the Williston Basin? 2) What is the distribution (areally and vertically) of stable isotopes in formation-waters in the basin? 3) What can my newly-discovered ""residual"" fluids from the basin tell us about the Phanerozoic evolution of seawater? 4) How can hydrogeological, hydrochemical, and petroleum geological data combined with numerical models of paleohydrogeology to understand and predict hydrocarbon migration/entrapment in the Williston Basin?



This work will lead to a new and better understanding of formation fluid-flow in sedimentary basins in general, and in the Williston Basin in particular. Fluid flow patterns mapped in this research will provide fundamental information required for CO2 sequestration projects and thus facilitate geological storage of greenhouse gases in the basin. This research will also provide explorationists with new techniques for analyzing and predicting oil accumulations and may directly or indirectly lead to the discovery of new hydrocarbon deposits.

"Many environmentally or economically important chemical reactions take place on catalytic surfaces, such as the CO-oxidation on platinum metals in catalytic automotive converters. Most of these reactions exhibit features of nonlinear dynamics systems under certain operating conditions. There are typical pressure and temperature regimes in which for instance chaotic behavior persists.

        The aim of our first project is to explore, theoretically and experimentally, new directions in controlling and manipulating surface reactions, attempting the ""taming of chaos"". Continuing with previous research, we plan to study pattern formation in the CO oxidation reaction on platinum under periodic forcing conditions through the gas phase. We will be extending these investigations to composite materials created by microlithography. In addition, we will utilize our focused laser beam to locally manipulate and control reaction patterns on microlithographically modified catalytic surfaces. 

        Another avenue of our research program will utilize ultra thin metal foils as catalysts for studying surface reactions. Due to the heat produced during a chemical reaction these foils buckle and this mechanical deformation can be used as a simple sensor for certain reactants. Ultra thin metal foils will become simple inexpensive ""mechanical"" instruments for measuring certain types of reaction rates at an unprecedented low budget, requiring minimal equipment and power. This will be explored further with interested industries.

        Our second research direction is moving towards another practical application, focusing on pitting corrosion. Our technique, Ellipso-Microscopy can now visualize changes of the thickness of the protective oxide layer surrounding metastable pitting events on stainless steels and other alloys. In collaboration with theoreticians, models of such corrosion phenomena will be further developed and analyzed. The aim of these studies will be to find surfactants, which, even in diminutive quantities are capable of suppressing the onset of pitting corrosion, which could be of enormous economical and environmental significance.

Its origins lie in the realization that finding solutions to algebraic equations or understanding the properties of the solutions is intimately tied to the intrinsic geometric nature of the algebraic varieties described by those equations.



The Lang-Vojta conjectures are one of the most spectacular realizations of this philosophy.  In general terms they connect the global behaviour of rational solutions of equations to the global behaviour of the curvature on the corresponding algebraic variety. The first part of this proposal studies local versions of the Lang-Vojta conjectures, and seeks to connect local properties of the curvature with the local accumulation of rational points.  It examines the properties of local measures of accumulation and curvature and their relation with rational curves. It also studies the passage from local to global, and how one might apply it to the Batyrev-Manin conjectures.



The second part of the proposal uses algebraic geometry to study representation theory. One of the fundamental mathematical insights of the twentieth century is that in order to understand representations we should search for and study their geometric realizations.   The Borel-Weil-Bott theorem provides such realizations in the cohomology of algebraic varieties. So far it is typically only the realizations on the zeroth cohomology groups which have been used and understood. This part of the proposal studies the new geometric and representation theoretic consequences which arise from the cup-product structure on the higher cohomology groups.

This proposal funds one postdoc, one undergradute student, and two to three doctoral students per year.

"The use of nitrogenous fertilizers in farming is a large input cost to farmers and has a profound negative impact on the environment. As the price of energy increases the cost of nitrogen fertilizer will also increase as its production involves a process that requires large amounts of energy. High input crops are dependent on the use of nitrogenous fertilizers; however, the majority of the nitrogen from these fertilizers (approximately 70%) is lost as runoff into surface and ground waters. Furthermore, nitrogenous fertilizers are responsible for the production of nitrous oxide (agricultural soils account for 70% of production), which contribute significantly to green house gases and the formation of acid rain. It is clearly valuable from both an economic and environmental point of view to decrease the use of nitrogenous fertilizers at current levels while maintaining crop yields. In the proposed work, we plan on studying nitrogen use efficiency in crop plants. Initially this trait will be studied using the model system rice, for which many genomic and genetic tools have been developed and then applying this knowledge to corn.  The reason for this choice is that as a cereal, rice will be more relevant to corn than would be 

Arabidopsis (the common model plant species). While important pathways and regulatory genes are often conserved between species, it is more likely that positive results in rice can be transferred to maize. We will test any genes found to be advantageous in rice through partnership with our industrial partner Syngenta who will transform these into corn. We will then test these lines to see if they have improved nitrogen use efficiency. Ultimately this research will assist in reducing the 

economic cost to farmers and help reduce the impact of agricultural production on aquatic ecosystems (surface and ground water) and reduce the levels of nitrous oxide being released into the air.

"Considerable stress will be placed on world-wide crop production due to an increased human population, an increase in the crops used per person and environmental issues.  Besides water availability, nitrogen is the major limiting factor in crop production.  To develop crops that can use nitrogen more efficiently, we must understand the role of genotype on its acquisition and use.  Therefore, it is essential to understand the role of signaling and regulatory mechanisms that control nitrogen metabolism under nitrogen limitation conditions.  In this proposal, the studies will focus on molecular genetic and genomic studies in Arabidopsis.  First, we wish to understand in much greater detail how a plant senses nitrogen limitation.  Second, we wish to target a set of transcription factors (GNC and CGA-1) for which we have considerable evidence for their role in controlling the carbon-nitrogen balance under nitrogen limitation.   Further, over-expression of these genes can lead to an enhanced growth phenotype in Arabidopsis and rice.  We identified the nitrogen limitation adaptability (nla) gene as a key component for the adaptation of Arabidopsis plant grown under limited nitrogen conditions. We will use a variety of techniques including genetic, biochemical and physiological approaches to identify additional genes that are essential for the nitrogen limitation adaptability pathway.  In addition, we will delineate the targets of  GNC and CGA-1 transcription factors  that will allow us to further understand their roles.  Finally, we will do a metabolome and transcriptome analysis of the response of Arabidopsis to limiting nitrogen both in wild-type and in the various mutant and over-expression lines that we have developed or will develop in the future.  The long term goal is to use this information to target genes in crop plants to develop genetic lines that yield better under field conditions where less nitrogen fertilizer is used.  This, in turn, would significantly improve both the economic and environmental sustainability of crop production.

"Synaptogenesis is a process by which nerve cells connect to other cells, such as neurons and muscle cells, and is a key event in the development of the nervous system and muscles. Recent work from our lab demonstrated an essential role for the ubiquitin system in regulating nervous system development and function, including motoneurons, which are nerve cells that innervate muscles. The ubiquitin system plays a pivotal role in controlling protein breakdown/stability, trafficking and endocytosis, and thus affects most biochemical pathways in the cell. Very important enzymes in the ubiquitination cascade are the ubiquitin ligases, which are responsible for substrate recognition and ubiquitin attachment to them. We had isolated the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 from several organisms, including the one from fruit flies (Drosophila, dNedd4), and shown recently that  it is important for axon guidance and synaptogenesis in flies. Our goal is to understand how dNedd4 and ubiquitination regulate synaptogenesis. Using biochemical and genetic approaches in Drosophila, we will investigate the signal transduction pathways that regulate the function of dNedd4 and its splice variants, and the role of these variants in regulating the dNedd4 target proteins commissureless (Comm) and roundabout (Robo), which play a critical role in axon guidance and synaptogenesis in flies. These studies are important to our understanding of the function of the ubiquitin system in general and its role in the nervous system in particular, and have implications to our knowledge of the growing list of disorders associated with misguided function of the ubiquitin system, including neurological diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

"My research interests lie in the field called Riemannian Geometry, which is a generalization

of the geometry of surfaces to higher dimensions.  Surfaces are geometric objects that locally

look like planes.  More specifically, I am working in the Geometric Calculus of Variations, which 

is a study of stationary objects in Riemannian Geometry, such as periodic geodesics, geodesic

loops, geodesic segments between two arbitrary points, stationary geodesic nets, minimal surfaces, etc.  A geodesic is a generalization of a straight line to Riemannian geometry and as such, it is one of its most basic objects.  Unlike straight lines, which are always infinite, some geodesics close on themselves like the equator on the standard sphere.  These geodesics are called periodic.  If a geodesic segment closes on itself, but not smoothly, it is called a geodesic loop.  Periodic geodesics play an important role in Geometry, Analysis and Dynamical Systems.  Stationary geodesic nets are close analogs of periodic geodesics.  They were first encountered in a study of optimal telephone networks, but they also appear in many other applications, including studies of social choice.  Minimal surfaces are used in Physics as mathematical models of soap bubbles, as well as in String Theory.  The questions I propose to study include investigating the connections  between the size of stationary objects and the size of the ambient space specified either by its diameter, (i.e. the longest distance between a pair of points), or its volume and perhaps, its other geometric parameters. I am also interested in the possible shapes of stationary geodesic nets, and their distribution.  In particular, my immediate goal is to investigate the following question: There is a famous result due to J.-P. Serre that says that between every two points of a closed Riemannian manifold there exist infinitely many geodesics.  That is,  there are infinitely many straight paths connecting a pair of points.  Though, the length of a shortest one is definitely bounded above by the diameter of a manifold, it is interesting to be able to say something about lengths of other geodesics.

"Bien que pr�sente sur le march� depuis une quinzaine d'ann�es, la batterie nickel-hydrure m�tallique (Ni-MH) n'a pas atteint sa maturit� et poss�de un potentiel d'am�lioration important. Ces am�liorations passent n�cessairement par le d�veloppement de nouveaux mat�riaux hydrurables. 

    A ce titre, les travaux propos�s dans le cadre de ce programme de recherche viseront � d�velopper de nouveaux mat�riaux � haute capacit� d'hydruration. Pour ce faire, nous �tudierons des alliages � base de Mg (Mg-Ti et ses d�riv�s) ayant la particularit� de pr�senter une structure cubique face centr�e (cfc) permettant d'avoir � la fois des sites interstitiels d'hydruration t�tra�driques et octa�driques et facilitant la diffusion de l'hydrog�ne. Ces alliages �tant m�tastables et donc difficiles � synth�tiser par des m�thodes m�tallurgiques conventionnelles, nous utiliserons le broyage m�canique � haute �nergie comme m�thode de synth�se. Parall�lement, nous travaillerons sur la mise au point d'une m�thode originale couplant l'�lectrochimie et l'�mission acoustique afin d'�tudier les ph�nom�nes de d�cr�pitation de divers mat�riaux hydrurables lors des cycles de charge/d�charge. L'�tude de ce processus de d�cr�pitation est primordiale car il joue un r�le majeur dans la d�gradation des performances des batteries Ni-MH. A long terme, ce programme de recherche pourrait aboutir � la conception de batteries Ni-MH � haute densit� d'�nergie qui pourraient concurrencer les batteries Li-ion et r�pondre aux exigences de nombreux march�s incluant celui des v�hicules hybrides/�lectriques.

    Notons par ailleurs que la formation de personnes hautement qualifi�es (PHQ) constituera un aspect important de mon programme de recherche puisque 60 % du budget demand� seront consacr�s au recrutement de PHQ (4 �tudiants au doctorat et 10 �tudiants sous-gradu�s).

Cet �quipement servira � �tudier in situ la d�cr�pitation de divers mat�riaux actifs pour batteries Li-ion et Ni-MH. On pense en particulier au silicium qui est un mat�riau actif d'�lectrode n�gative pour batteries Li-ion tout � fait r�volutionnaire puisque sa capacit� sp�cifique peut atteindre dix fois celle du graphite. Sa tenue au cyclage est cependant tr�s faible du fait de sa d�cr�pitation induite par son expansion volumique importante (jusqu'� ~300 %) lors de sa r�action avec le lithium. Il en est de m�me pour les compos�s actifs � base d'hydrures m�talliques (MH) qui peuvent �galement r�agir �lectrochimiquement avec le lithium (ex : MgH2 qui pr�sente une capacit� th�orique de 2 038 mAh/g) mais qui ont aussi une faible dur�e de vie du fait d'une d�cr�pitation importante (expansion volumique de 85 % pour MgH2). Cet �quipement sera �galement utilis� pour �tudier la d�cr�pitation d'hydrures m�talliques (ex : MgNi, MgTi, etc) pour batteries Ni-MH sur lesquels nous travaillons depuis plusieurs ann�es.

L'�tude de cette d�cr�pitation gr�ce � l'�quipement demand� se fera en fonction des caract�ristiques chimiques, microstructurales et morphologiques de nos mat�riaux d'�lectrode et des conditions de charge/d�charge ce qui nous permettra d'optimiser la composition et le protocole de mise en forme de nos �lectrodes.

La mise au point d'un tel outil d'analyse devrait susciter un int�r�t soutenu de la part de la communaut� scientifique travaillant dans le domaine des batteries car � notre connaissance, il n'existe actuellement aucun outil d'analyse in situ permettant d'�tudier pr�cis�ment ces ph�nom�nes de d�cr�pitation.","Advancement of knowledge","Institut national de la recherche scientifique",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","�lectrochimie","Chimie physique"
"Une source d'am�lioration ayant potentiellement un large impact sur la densit� d'�nergie des batteries Li-ion est le mat�riau actif de l'�lectrode n�gative. Actuellement, le mat�riau actif utilis� est le graphite, dont la capacit� sp�cifique est de 372 mAh/g. Il a �t� r�cemment d�montr� que sous certaines conditions, le silicium est un mat�riau actif tout � fait � r�volutionnaire �, puisque sa capacit� sp�cifique peut atteindre dix fois celle du graphite. La r�action �lectrochimique de formation de l'alliage silicium-lithium est r�versible. Cependant, cette r�versibilit� est fortement contrari�e par l'expansion volumique importante du Si lors de sa r�action avec le lithium (~300% contre ~10% avec le graphite) ce qui conduit � sa d�cr�pitation et cons�quemment � la perte de connectivit� �lectronique au sein de l'�lectrode et � une tr�s faible tenue en cyclage. Au cours des derni�res ann�es, beaucoup de travaux ont �t� effectu�s afin de r�pondre � cette probl�matique mais � ce jour, aucun r�sultat totalement satisfaisant et permettant d'envisager une application commerciale n'a �t� obtenu. Le principal verrou technologique � lever consiste donc � trouver une solution permettant de faire fonctionner du silicium sur un grand nombre de cycles de charge/d�charge sans perte de capacit�. Ceci implique d'optimiser la composition, la microstructure, la r�activit� de surface du mat�riaux actif � base de Si, et la mise en forme de l'�lectrode composite (mat�riau actif + additif conducteur + liant) sur le collecteur de courant afin que la percolation �lectronique et la stabilit� dimensionnelle de l'�lectrode soient maintenues durant le fonctionnement de la batterie.

"Biodiversity is critical to ecological understanding and environmental management.  Insects are critical components of biodiversity as they are often the most abundant organism in terms of species and individuals performing various ecological functions.  However, for insects, the total number of species on earth can only be crudely estimated and only preliminary syntheses are available for the Canadian fauna including species richness for particular habitat types. Insects are useful because of the diverse opportunities they provide for analysis of numerous highly complex systems providing insight into the relationship among taxa and the function of communities.  Therefore systematics of insects is of critical importance for biodiversity studies.  Work in systematics must consist of separate projects contributing to a program of the inventory of biodiversity. The sheer number of specimens and taxa require specialization for development of authoritative expertise.  My systematic research emphasizes study of the Canadian fauna because it is accessible to me and my students; it is sufficiently known to provide a foundation for research, yet many problems have not received attention for decades.  Secondary emphasis is placed on other North American regions (particularly Churchill, Manitoba) and adjacent Russian  and the Neotropics. In systematic projects, I study one taxon in many kinds of habitats.  I specialize in the study of aquatic Adepahga (Coleoptera) with emphasis on the family Dytiscidae because they are locally abundant and often form the numerically dominant predators in many aquatic systems; they are one of the most diverse families in Canada with 276 species ranking them 7th/118 families;and, they present challenging taxonomic and phylogenetic problems. In biodiversity projects, I study many taxa in one kind of habitat.  I specialize in biodiversity of grassland habitats types, notably various kinds of prairies or grasslands.  Grasslands were locally abundant and widespread, had an enormous unique and interesting insect fauna which remains largely unknown and underexplored.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","University of Manitoba",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Taxonomie, syst�matique et phylog�n�tique","�volution et �cologie"

"In addition to allow life forms to exist, cellular membranes organize the interior of the eukaryotic cell into biochemically distinct compartments in which specific cellular functions are performed. The transport of proteins (cargo) between discontinuous sub-cellular compartments relies on the assembly and disassembly of multilayered coat protein complexes (CPCs) onto cellular membrane. To-date, three major types of vesicles have been described: clathrin-, COPI (coat protein complex I)- and COPII (coat protein complex II)-coated vesicles. Clathrin-coated vesicles bud from the plasma membrane, trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes. COPI-coated vesicles traffic primarily from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and between Golgi cisternae. COPII-coated vesicles traffic from the ER to the Golgi. The structures of clathrin and COPII coated vesicles have recently been published. Although these vesicles appear to share some common mechanical designs, there are significant differences in the way the vesicles are assembled. 

The structure of COPI-coated vesicles and the assembly units that is the coatamer (a seven subunits macro-molecular complexes of ~600 kDa) and the small ras GTPase Arf-1 remain by en-large unknown. As part of my research program presented here, I will determine, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single particle image analysis, the structure of the F and B sub-complexes and entire coatamer and determine the localization of the seven subunits within the coatamer as well as determine the interactions them. Using cryo-EM and cryo electron microscopy, I will study structure of COPI-like coated vesicles assembled in vitro on liposomes as well as COPI vesicles assembled from Golgi membranes. These studies will reveal what are the structural commonalities and differences between COPI-, COPII- and clathrin-coated vesicles and provide clues concerning the specificities of these vesicles in the different cellular pathways. In the long term, these studies will be extended to the study of COPI-coated vesicles specific cargo proteins recruitment, assembly in vivo, docking and fusion.","Advancement of knowledge","McGill University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Biologie cellulaire","Biologie cellulaire"

"My research program determines how hydrology, climate, and ecosystem structure and function interact to control biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems.  The current focus of my program is on northern peatlands because of their potential importance in Holocene and contemporary carbon cycle, and hence climate.  The 'peat' of peatlands represents a huge (~ 400 Pg C) removal of atmospheric CO2, and the anoxic decomposition of peat is a source of atmospheric CH4.  Peatlands are complexly and adaptively linked to hydrology, and in northern regions permafrost.  Over 30% of peatlands are located in permafrost regions.  Climate predictions indicate that by 2100 an increase in active layer depth, with consequent changes in surface hydrology.  Permafrost loss will alter both peatland biogeochemistry and vegetation structure but there has been little research on the heuristic links among climate, hydrology and peatland ecosystem function and structure.  First order questions such as 'What is the relative importance of changes in greenhouse biogeochemistry compared to the direct affects of changes in vegetation structure of surface climate - e.g. albedo and energy partitioning?', and ""Does permafrost loss affect the water borne loss of carbon?', have yet to be addressed.   Simulation models lack the necessary functions to simulate these changes, and DOC export pathway has largely been ignored even though it appears to be of the same order of magnitude as the net atmospheric exchanges.

    )	In the proposed research I will assess, through empirical and modelling studies, the relative importance of changes in biogeochemistry, water borne carbon exports, and surface climate in permafrost peatland complexes, to provide the knowledge to parameterize these processes for climate-ecosystem simulations.  To assess the relative importance of contemporary changes in peatlands I will also simulate the contribution to net radiative forcing that northern peatlands have had over the Holocene.

"Current growth for Canadian oil and gas exploration and production is taking place in extreme situations, namely in ultra-deep water, in Arctic environments, and in remote locations where cold (sub-zero) temperatures and long pipelines are common. At low temperatures, wax-like compounds present in crude oil may solidify and deposit on the inner wall of pipelines leading to a reduction in throughput and potentially outright blockage.  Pipeline development for these harsh environments requires a high degree of certainty on the reliability of the pipeline system and preventative measures designed to avoid plugging.  The present research focusses on novel means of preventing this problem, by using a fundamental scientific approach to understand how compounds in crude oil solidify within pipelines.  With a greater focus on Arctic and Atlantic exploration, the results of this research will aid the Canadian petrochemical industry implement strategies minimising downtime associated with pipeline blockage.

"We have demonstrated that the stimulation of A2A adenosine receptors induced a reduction in cell death. However, the molecular mechanisms for this beneficial effect are poorly understood. We hypothesize that this is partly due to the conditions used to study this receptor. Notably, the concentration of adenosine, which is the natural substance reacting with this receptor, increases during specific conditions such as oxygen reduction. Few studies have taken this important point into consideration. 

In the first part of this proposal, we have decided to study the intracellular changes observed following the activation of this receptor in different conditions varying from normal to reduced oxygen availability. 

In the second step of this proposal, we will perform study to determine which enzyme(s) modulated by this receptor is/are important to protect from specific death cell called apoptosis.

At the end of this program, we should have a better idea of the molecular mechanisms involved in the protective effect of this receptor.

"In recent decades, decision support systems and optimization software have generated huge savings while significantly increasing the productivity of organizations in Canada and around the world. Commercial software packages based on Operations Research (OR) technologies have been able to produce near optimal solutions to many of the difficult problems faced by modern industries. Airline demand forecasting, fleet sizing, flight scheduling, crew scheduling and rostering, and aircraft routing are examples of some of the areas which have benefited. Typically, each of the these problems has been addressed separately and in sequence, with outputs from the first problems solved serving as inputs to those coming later. This sequential and sometimes simplified approach allowed researchers to understand the individual problems and develop effective methodologies to address them, but the process can be somewhat myopic since optimal global decision-making is not specifically addressed. Even though the integration of all levels of decisions in order to model the complete problem is in most cases impossible or impractical, progress toward that end should in many cases yield additional cost savings and gains in productivity. The main obstacle to realising the potential additional benefits of integrated decision making lies in the structural differences which exist among the models used to address different parts of the overall problem. Algorithms developed to optimize parts of the global problem cannot simply be merged together. The proposed research program thus aims at making significant progress toward solving rich integrated decision problems by proposing new methodologies based on hybridizing traditional operations research approaches and Constraint Programming (CP) techniques. CP concentrate on the feasibility of a solution; logical inference and filtering techniques are used to discard quickly those partial solutions which can be shown to be infeasible, even though the majority of the variables are still unassigned. The combination of CP's modeling flexibility and its emphasis on feasibility together with OR's optimization efficiency offers the promise of decision tools that are both powerful and versatile.

"The research interest of my laboratory is to understand how cells perceive changes in their environment and elaborate an appropriate response to these changes. The coupling of this perception to a response is termed signal transduction, as it involved the transmission of the information perceived by the cell to machineries involved in cellular activities. These signals are transmitted via a wide variety of means and their study is essential to properly understand cell functions. I'm particularly interested in the response generated by a pathogen when it meets a target host cell. Epithelia are tissues that lined our body forming a physical barrier between our inner organs and the surrounding environment. Our entire life as humans is spent in contact with countless microorganisms, and the epithelium plays a key role in protecting us from harmful pathogens. In this proposal we will look at the differences in response of five epithelia (skin, lung, intestine, kidney and cervix) to an opportunistic pathogen, the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus to understand the fundamental mechanisms of signal transduction in the host-pathogen interaction. The nature of these signals will vary according to a number of parameters like strength, duration and amplitude, which are all essential in giving rise to the specificity needed for different cellular activities using a finite number of molecules. The majority of studies in signal transduction are based on end-point assays, from which it is difficult to evaluate the importance of the aforementioned parameters. Therefore we are proposing to develop fluorescent markers of key intracellular pathways to dynamically measure their activation following the exposure of epithelial cells to S. aureus. Taken together we hope to better understand the fundamental mechanisms of perception of an infection by the epithelium initiating the host response.

"I propose to develop a set of tools for systems biology based on techniques deriving from theoretical chemistry. Metabolic control analysis (MCA) is a successful theory for analyzing the response of a biochemical system to small changes in (e.g.) concentrations of key proteins. The current theory is based on equations which are only strictly valid when large numbers of molecules are involved. This is not the case for many important processes in living cells. I propose to develop a version of MCA which is valid in systems with few copies of some molecules. This will be useful to understand genetic regulation since genes are only present in two copies in our cells.

I also propose to work on methods for reducing (simplifying) models involving small numbers of molecules. This is important because these models, paradoxically, are very complex and can overwhelm even the largest computers.

Finally, I am pursuing applications which will allow me to showcase our theoretical methods in the areas of cellular biology and of developmental biology. Projects include the modeling of transport of RNA out of the nucleus, of development of veins in plant leaves, and of the maintenance of left-right asymmetry during vertebrate embryogenesis.

"This is a proposal for developing and applying statistical methodology for ecosystem research. I have been engaged for the past five years in collaborative research on (i) potential causes of the collapse of Rivers and Smith Inlet sockeye salmon, (ii) ecological impacts of salmon aquaculture on wild Pacific salmon, and (iii) fire history in dry forests in the South Okanagan Valley, BC. Following is a brief summary of my achievements and goals for the first and third of these projects.

Sockeye salmon returning to Rivers and Smith inlets on the British Columbia Central Coast used to support the third largest sockeye salmon fishery in the province. Returns dwindled in the late 1990's to a few thousand. Limited evidence available in 2001 suggested that the cause of the decline was most likely in the early-marine phase of the sockeye salmon life cycle. Our research has confirmed that the inlets provide critical habitat for the young fish as they attempt to adjust to marine conditions - and that the suitability of this habitat is highly dependent on river flows. To enhance this insight, the collaborative team that I am co-leading is developing a hydrodynamic model of the inlet and an associated model of the plankton dynamics. I propose to adapt and extend newly emerging methodology for relating precise, but possibly inaccurate, differential equation models to imprecise estimates of the actual system behaviour. 

The fire history project has highlighted major changes since the onset of European influence. A regime of frequent, low-intensity fires has been replaced by one of infrequent, more substantial fires. I have also found intriguing evidence of cyclic fluctuations in the charcoal concentration in lake sediments. In one lake, the frequency appears close to the dominant frequency in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, though the cycles are much more regular than in the ocean phenomenon itself. To assess the regularity more definitively, I need better estimates of the age-at-depth within the core. I propose to develop improved statistical methodology for addressing such needs, and to apply the results in this fascinating application.

"Mink nursing sickness is a metabolic disorder characterized by impaired blood sugar regulation. It occurs when the demands for lactation require extensive mobilization of body energy reserves. Females that are either too heavy or too thin show higher variability in their blood sugar levels and have impaired health and reproduction. Rapid mobilization of body fat reserves is known to result in fatty liver (hepatic lipidosis), loss of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) and the development of insulin resistance. The long term goals of this research program are to understand the underlying biology of fatty liver syndrome and its association with mink nursing sickness. I plan to investigate the relationships that exist between body condition, fatty acid nutrition and management practices, such as feeding intensity and rapid weight loss, and the regulation of body fat and blood sugar metabolism in the mink. My objectives are to study the impact of the nutritional status on the metabolic response and the gene expression of key enzymes participating in body fat and blood sugar metabolism. Feeding experiments will be carried out where varying fatty acid profiles will be introduced to mink fed at two feeding intensity levels to induce lean and obese body conditions. The effects of rapid weight loss will be examined in response to short term fasting. I will also evaluate the level of oxidative stress and markers of inflammation in the mink with different n-3/n-6 PUFA profiles. In addition, I want to examine the formation of unfolded protein inclusions (Mallory bodies) in the liver tissue during fasting-induced hepatic lipidosis and more closely investigate their role in the fatty liver disease using cultured hepatocytes.

"Refrigeration is a pervasive technology enabling high standards of living in industrialized economies; an example being increased life expectancies through the preservation of food and medicines. Refrigeration cycles are also found in industrial processes such as gas liquefaction, air separation, chillers, and air-conditioners. Cryofuels such as natural gas and hydrogen also highlight the need for efficient cryogenic refrigerators and liquefiers. Higher efficiencies and the use of benign working substances are two of the primary drivers for the development of alternative refrigeration technologies.



Common refrigeration cycles use a fluid as the working substance. Compressing a gas or vapour, rejecting heat, and then expanding the fluid causes a decrease in temperature and allows heat to be absorbed in a continuous cycle. Overall cycle efficiencies are typically limited by inefficient compression and irreversible expansion processes. Such devices are mature and inexpensive; however, they typically rely upon the use of fluids which can contribute to ozone depletion, are greenhouse gases, or are combustible. 



A process that avoids the problems of fluid cycles is the active magnetic regenerator (AMR) cycle, a specific form of magnetic refrigeration (MR). MR devices use solids as the working medium coupled to inert heat transfer fluids; both are safe and environmentally benign. Magnetic refrigeration makes use of a phenomenon known as the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) - a reversible temperature change associated with a change in magnetic field. Some of the potential advantages associated with an AMR device are high efficiencies, high power densities, and the use of inert fluids. The proposed research program is aimed at characterizing AMR behavior, optimizing performance in terms of cooling power and temperature span, and furthering the development of magnetic refrigeration devices.

"A central goal is completion of a two-volume book on the Fundamentals of Nuclear Models with an experimentalist, J.L. Wood. A primary objective of this book is to establish the experimental and mathematical foundations of the models and theories of nuclear structure so that subsequent developments can build upon them. This long-term project, now nearing completion, also ensures that the overall objectives of ours research programs remain in focus. It also serves to identify critical gaps in the data and the theory, that can be filled. Thus, John Wood is a leader of an experimental research team, using ISAC at the Triumf laboratory, for which I am a consulting member. On the theory side, a major part of my program has been to give the macroscopic collective models a microscopic expression in terms of interacting nucleons. Thus, the collective and shell models are seen as complementary and the intuition gained from one is used to guide applications of the other.  For example, a pedagogical development of the collective model in terms of multipole moments instead of the historical shape coordinates, raises the status of the collective model from a liquid-drop model to a solvable submodel of the shell model.  This makes it possible to associate coupling schemes in the shell model with corresponding collective models and relate the symmetry limits of the two models. A challenge, is to handle situations in which incompatible symmetries and coupling schemes are in competition.  Considerable progress was made during the last grant period by focusing on the presently popular quantum phase transitions that occur in systems for which there are competing dynamical symmetries.  We have observed and explained, by introducing the concept of quasi-dynamical symmetry, that one among competing dynamical symmetries tends to dominate.  To take advantage of this observation, we are developing a new approach to quantum many-body theory, without predefined bases, that is designed to handle systems with quasi-symmetries as well as those with symmetries.

"Canada annually spends over $2 billion in collection and disposal of waste. Barrier systems - comprised of a geomembrane liner (a thin plastic sheet) overlying a geosynthetic clay liner (a thin layer of low permeability clay) and a natural soil layer - are used to line the bottom of land fills and heap-leaching facilities used in mineral extraction (eg. for gold and copper mining). The purpose of the barrier system is to prevent groundwater contamination by minimizing the escape of toxic chemicals into the surrounding environment. Barrier systems presently used to contain municipal waste were developed with heavy metals and hydrocarbons as the main contaminants of concern. However, there are new emerging contaminants of concern  like nanoparticles, leached plastic stabilizers and brominated flame retardants - where there is growing concern about their potential release into the environment. Virtually nothing is known about the effectiveness of current barrier systems to contain these contaminants. Another important question is how long will plastic geomembranes act as an effective barrier to contain emerging contaminants of concern. This project presents an opportunity to answer these questions by examining these new contaminants in the context of a systems engineering approach, which we have been developing over the past few years, to address a problem of major national importance; namely ensuring the health and security of surface water and groundwater. The experimental findings from this project will be used in optimization modelling to be conducted as part of the systems engineering evaluation of existing designs and in the development of improved barrier system designs. The research brings together university researchers, engineering consultants, liner manufacturers and regulators who will work to help improve the performance of barrier systems to contain emerging contaminants of concern. The research will be conducted by 4 PhD and 2 Masters students, 1 Postdoctoral fellow and 1 technician who will obtain specialized research training and gain practical experience through the active involvement of the industrial partners.

"Machine learning and statistical pattern recognition have been extremely influential in many scientific and engineering fields which require the analysis and interpretation of large amounts of data.

"Environmental DNA libraries that recover functional genes from complex environments of unculturable microorganisms provide a promising source of genetic material for biotechnology and drug discovery applications. Integrons collect functional genes, known as gene cassettes, by a site-specific recombination mechanism. Recently, massive ancestral versions, the superintegrons (SIs), were discovered in the genomes of diverse proteobacterial species. SI gene cassettes with an identifiable activity encoded proteins related to simple adaptive functions, including functional resistance, virulence and metabolic genes. PCR probing of environmental samples has demonstrated that the abundance and diversity of integron gene cassettes in natural environments is substantial. Thus, SI cassettes represent a vast, prepackaged resource of functional genes. Since integrons are natural gene cloning and expression systems, the objective proposed herein is to develop an integron-based genetic selection system to recover large contiguous DNA fragments from unculturable microorganisms that specifically harbour integron gene cassettes. This will be done as follows: i) cosmid or BAC libraries will be constructed from DNA that is directly extracted from soil and water samples using published protocols; ii) clones containing integron cassette arrays will be positively selected in vivo using a genetic screen that exploits the activity of the integron system. The presence of cassettes will be verified by PCR and sequencing; iii) novel antibiotic resistance genes that confer resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics will be identified from this pool using a second integron-based expression system, however, a selection for any desired phenotype can be done. These studies will help to identify environmental sources of integron-associated genes, will aid in predicting the future development of antibiotic resistance and recover functional genes with potential use in molecular biology and industrial applications.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","University of Toronto",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Bact�riologie",Microbiologie

"This proposal will address two themes of research which involve molecular-level control over the composition and structure of the organic films, which will be achieved using novel synthetic techniques, cryogenic processing methods, and selective dissociation mechanisms that we are developing.

We will create and study metal-organic-metal junction systems by the electron-induced dissociation of organometallic adsorbates that are deposited on the organic layers under cryogenic and UHV conditions.  These junctions are excellent models for the study of charge transfer and electrical conduction, with applications in molecular electronics; unfortunately, traditional methods for their preparation (e.g. thermal evaporation, electrochemical reduction) often cause chemical and structural modifications to the fragile organic substrate. Our objective is to develop procedures by which organometallic adsorbates can be reduced to metal deposits while minimizing the damage introduced into the substrate organic layers.  By controlling the energy and current density of the incident electron beam, we will map out the energy-dependent dissociation processes for the organometallics, while avoiding conditions that induce substrate damage. 

A second theme of this research is catalyst development for steam reforming of hydrocarbons to make molecular hydrogen, for use in solid-oxide fuel cells.  We have developed porous Ni-based materials that show stable and efficient hydrogen production at 500-700 oC.  Most importantly, we have found that submonolayer coverages of chemisorbed thiols can reduce the 'coking' of these catalysts by 2-3 orders of magnitude; this discovery can extend the life cycle of catalysts and facilitate the reforming of heavier hydrocarbons in fuel cells.  The mechanism for this protection is as yet unclear, and there is little known of the organic films structure in these systems.  We will study the adsorption of these thiols on Ni crystals and films, as well as porous Ni solids, in order to identify the adsorption sites, and thus address the protective mechanism(s).

"It has been shown in an initial study that hydrological changes and base level drop anticipated for St-Lawrence tributaries in the climate change context will have important impact on their longitudinal profile and on sediment supply to the St-Lawrence. The specific goal of the present study is to extend the 1D modelling approach used in the initial study to include a wider view of the potential effects of environmental changes on the tributaries dynamics. The project will focus on 1) the simulations of the spatial and temporal patterns of river adjustment and the forecasting of sediment transport volume that will be supplied to the St-Lawrence, 2) a better understanding of the winter/spring period, which is most likely be affected by the global climate changes, in particular of the ice cover formation and breakup processes and of their effects on sediment transport and

delivery 3) an assessment of the impacts of hydrological, morphological and sedimentological changes on riparian habitats, mainly at the river mouth. This research will combine a modeling approach and field surveys on two St-Lawrence tributaries. The project will provide new data and will require the development and improvement of modelling tools that will be compatible with the existing 2 D hydrodynamic models used for the St-Lawrence River.The project is closely connected with the partner's interests and needs in term of comprehension of sediment transport and bank erosion processes, ice cover formation and response of riparian vegetation to environmental changes.","Modelling and mathematical simulation of natural processes","Universit� de Montr�al",3,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","G�omorphologie","Sciences de la terre"
"Alluvial rivers are complex and fundamental components of the natural environment and a key resource for human activities and for wildlife. Although river systems have been extensively studied in the past, their dynamics and response to environmental changes, both natural and anthropogenic, are still far from being understood. Numerous spectacular examples of major and unforeseen impacts on the shape, size and pattern of alluvial channels have been caused by severe floods or by periods of drought such as those recently witnessed in Europe, North America, and elsewhere. In order to understand the behaviour of rivers we need to advance our knowledge on the fundamental mechanical processes that drive the river system. This research program focuses on the relationships, feedbacks and mutual adjustments between flow structure, sediment mobility and the resulting adjustments of the bed (form and bed material distribution) in rivers. The particular scope of the research is on the role of flow turbulence (i.e. smaller scales of motion in fluid flow) in these relationships. The objectives of the research program are to: develop a better model of the properties, origin and evolution of large-scale turbulent flow structures in uniform and non-uniform river flows; to quantify and understand changes in flow structures as flow stage changes; to integrate turbulence in the characterisation of the variability of patches and to assess the role of turbulence on fish behaviour; quantify the relations between flow structures and bedload sediment transport; determine the effects of bed morphology on bed particle movements at the reach scale. These objectives will be met through interconnected projects that will rely on both classical and innovative methods and experimental designs. The experiments will be conducted in rivers in eastern Qu�bec at a selection of field sites, some of which have permanent installations for the measurements of flow, bed topography and particle displacements. The results of this research will be used to improve current models on the development of turbulence and on the effects of turbulence on fish behaviour and sediment transport.

"The long term objective of the current proposal is to further investigate the role of changes in muscle cell fluid levels on the control of muscle metabolism, as we have previously shown that changes in muscle cell fluid levels lead to changes in how these cells metabolize energy.  We will achieve a number of specific short term goals with this proposal; firstly, we will establish a detailed time course for changes in muscle cell fluid levels in response to changes in the composition of the fluid in which they are bathed.  We will also determine the time course for recovery from such changes.  Another goal of this work is to establish what intracellular signaling pathways are influenced by these changes in fluid volume and to determine the extent to which these pathways are altered.  Finally, we will establish how the changes in these intracellular signaling pathways influence metabolism within skeletal muscle.   

     During previous experiments, we established a working model that allows us to successfully alter the fluid volume of single isolated skeletal muscles.  We also have shown that during rest and after muscle contraction that energy metabolism is altered with differing fluid levels within the muscle.   It is proposed that changes in muscle cell volume contribute as a control mechanism to the changes in substrate metabolism that occur within skeletal muscle.   

     The proposed experiments are designed to better understand the influence of these fluid level changes on energy use in muscle.  They are also intended to allow us to better understand the signaling processes used in muscle during fluid changes, and to determine if these signaling changes are resulting in the changes we are seeing in energy metabolism in the muscle.  Collectively, this work will allow for a better understanding of how skeletal muscle uses energy and the factors that can influence these functions. Understanding the mechanisms behind these processes has implications in various pathological conditions of fuel homeostasis such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.

"This research program is designed to examine the influence of movement context on the planning and control of a sequence of reaching movements.  The theoretical approach derives from the coordinated control program model where reaching is seen to involve the coordination of a number of control programs.   Each program is thought to respond to particular task demands or constraints.  Our model proposes that the constraints acting on the control programs for each reaching movement in a sequence are used to plan and control the manual sequence throughout its course.  The specific values for each constraint (e.g., target size, target location) serve as features for control programs for each reaching movement in the sequence.  In this work movement context is defined as the similarity of the movements in the sequence in terms of the specific values of these constraint features (e.g., target size) and the number of movement components in each movement or response element (e.g., pointing [transport component] versus reaching and grasping [transport+grasp components]).  Traditionally, temporal measures (e.g. reaction and movement time) have been used to reflect these effects where sequences composed of dissimilar movements, for example, have been found to take longer to initiate and execute.  The goal in this research is to use detailed analyses of movement (kinematic analyses) in concert with these traditional temporal measures to discern more clearly how context affects movement sequencing. A multiple series of experiments are planned which attempt to address a number of the predictions from this model.  The first series will examine the factor pertaining to the similarity among the response elements in a sequence.  The second will investigate the number of components controlled for each element in the sequence. A third series will examine the neural correlates of context in movement sequencing examining persons with stroke correlating performance with damage to different brain areas as evidenced in measures of lesion localization using magnetic resonance imaging.  This research program will afford new insights into the neurobehavioural mechanisms underlying the performance of sequences of reaching movements.

Such requirements, coupled with the realities of high-volume commercial applications, translate into several component-level technological challenges that today are barely being met:  frequency-agile or multiband RF circuits and antennas, increased integration levels of RF transceivers and antennas at limited cost/performance degradations, acceptable DC/RF conversion and operating efficiencies, to name only a few. These difficulties are severely compounded when operating frequencies move toward the mm-wave band, as they eventually must to avoid spectrum crowding and to permit emerging applications such as short-range multi-Gbps wireless links (i.e. 60 GHz and above).  A number of exciting new materials and RF technologies appear promising, at least individually: nanometric (65 nm, 45 nm) CMOS for low-power active circuitry, GaN HEMT for high-efficiency power stages, liquid-crystal polymer (LCP) and low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) substrates for passives, antennas and packaging.  This work focuses on active antennas that intimately combine these and other active, passive and packaging components with novel radiating structures.  The proposed research addresses in several ways the major challenges associated with the development of next generation mm-wave wireless communicators.

Successful realization of high-performance mm-wave active antennas using advanced system-on-chip and system-in-package approaches will have a tremendous impact on the wireless communications industry: terminals may be produced more competitively than ever before, as they will benefit from the advantages of reduced size and weight, better reliability, increased bandwidth and functionality, and lower cost (by incorporating functionality ""for free"" in the package).","Communications equipment","Carleton University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Dispositifs, circuits et technologie hyperfr�quences et d'ondes millim�triques","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"

"Our Project in subatomic physics is a continuation of our research program started few years ago at TRIUMF to exploit the new unstable beams available at the ISAC facility to study reaction dynamics between heavy nuclei of relatively light mass. 

      The analytic expression of the nuclear potential includes an important term dependent of the neutron-to-proton ratio in the nucleus. This term reflects important properties of the nuclear interaction. We plan to creuser that important aspect of nature by using several unstable beams, available at ISAC, as projectiles to generate collisions. The projectiles, with different neutron-to-proton ratios up to 50% difference, causent nuclear reactions ejecting particles in variable probabilities. The detection facility operated to identify those particles and measure their energy is called H�racles. That multidetector a nearly 80 detection units mounted at different angles to allow a detectiona s complete as possible of all particles produced in each event, so that we can reconstruct each collision one by one. Those detectors are plastic scintillators, CsI and BaF2 crystals, also scintillators, and silicon crystals. They are installed at different angles according to their respective detection properties as their capability to stop particles of different energies, light particles or heavier nuclei identified in the process, and their energy resolution.

     The analysis of data so acquired from thousnads of collisions allows to extract different distribution of physics observables which can be compared to theoretical predictons based on models of which the parameters, usually adjustable, will allow their prediction power in the context of physics properties as deduced from experiments.

"Antibiotic resistance to bacterial infections is a major concern to health care systems. Hence new and alternative strategies to fight diseases are required and amongst these, prophylactic methods such as vaccinations have been extremely successful. Important infectious diseases like pneumonia, tuberculosis, and meningitis have been eradicated in developed countries due to massive vaccination programs. In this regard, our group has previously contributed to the commercialization of two such vaccines. We are proposing herein two novel and promising approaches aimed at preventing the early stage of infections by a) blocking bacteria from attaching and colonizing host tissues by virtue of their carbohydrate binding proteins present at the tip of their pilli and b) by stopping the assembly of these pilli using new therapies called pilicides. The likelihood of developing resistance is therefore greatly reduced since bacteria cannot mutate their carbohydrate receptors without impeding their attachment processes.

     Cell surface carbohydrates present on human epithelial linings as glycolipids and glycoproteins are responsible for the bacterial recognition and attachment. These binding interactions are usually weak but nature has circumvented this problem by using multiple copies of the binding partners. Our proposal is based on the design of new nanometric molecules (glycodendrimers) that also expose several copies of the carbohydrates in order to foul the bacteria by binding and surrounding them with high affinity, thus preventing their attachment. In order to simplify the preparation associated with complex carbohydrate structures, we use fundamental aspects associated with medicinal chemistry. With this strategy in mind, simpler carbohydrate ligands will be prepared using modern synthetic methods. The rapid and efficient assembly of highly branched glycodendrimers using popular chemical processes (""click chemistry""), heterocyclic pharmacophores, and pro-drug construction will be undertaken. The diseases targeted with this approach are urinary tract infections caused by E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in cystic fibrosis, and cancer cell metastasis.

"Data collection over time on a particular phenomenon gives rise to a time series. Such data are collected on a regular basis for physical phenomena, for phenomena related to human activities and in many areas of science and engineering. An important role of  a statistician is to help the decision maker to draw the  right decisions from the available data with the most efficient modeling. In contrast with classical statistics that rely heavily on the assumption that the observations are independent, time-series data are generally correlated and it is essential to take that characteristics into account in the modeling process. 



Furthermore, due to the cyclical nature of many phenomena, namely  solar radiation, tides, meteorological  processes, economic and financial activities, etc, many observed time series exhibit a periodic (or seasonal) structure. My research programme focuses on the modeling of seasonal time series and more particularly on the following two topics: 1) the development of inference tools for a general class of periodic models that take into account certain nonlinearity characteristics of the errors, and 2) the development of diagnostic tools for such models. The new methodology will be applied to hydrological, economic and financial data.

"The long-term objectives of the proposed research program center on the development of advanced signal processing techniques and associated physical implementations (i.e. VLSI chips) to support the future growth, development and increasing pervasiveness of wireless networks in general and high bit-rate (i.e. broadband) systems in particular, with a specific focus on 1- self-organization and radio resource management through distributed intelligence, 2- the deployment of multi-antenna solutions to support beamforming and MIMO (multi-input, multi-output) processing in the context of such distributed wireless networks, 3- complexity and implementation issues pertaining to the cost-effective hardware crystallization of the proposed concepts. 



The program is based on a novel ""distributed base station"" (DBS) paradigm which allows high-performance multi-user communication networks to be deployed at low cost in an ad hoc manner by relying on self-organization behavior throughout the network to manage precious radio resources (e.g. channels). This is coupled with the use of multiple antennas at both user nodes and microstations to implement ""multiuser MIMO"", thus maximizing both the effective throughput and the number of supportable users in a given spectrum chunk and geographic area.



The approach and forthcoming results are of general scope, and could apply in cellular communications, wireless LANs, wireless sensor networks, ad hoc networks, etc. Furthermore, the self-organizing and dynamically adaptive nature of the proposed networks makes them highly robust and tolerant to local failures, which is ideal for combat zone communications where rapid deployment and robustness are paramount.","Communications technologies (satellites, radar, etc.)","Universit� Laval",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Syst�mes de t�l�communications sans fil","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"
"The study of bacterial adaptation to environmental change requires rigorous culture conditions.

Some of these share also the characteristics of sudden dormancy in late-phase cultures and warrant research in to their mechanisms of adaptation to environmental stress. The automated sampling and analysis instrument requested will allow us to expand our research into new horizons, exploiting proteomic and transcriptomic strategies to better understand how horizontal gene transfer translates into ecological fitness in Vibrio cholerae, and how environmental conditions affect the metabolism in Streptomyces spp., S. aureus, and Frankia sp.

"Filamentous actinobacteria of the genus Frankia are ubiquitous and participate significantly in global nitrogen fixation. With their host plants (actinorhizal plants, amongst which alders), they establish a root nodule symbiosis analogous to that of legumes with rhizobia. In North America, alders are of particular interest for their distribution, robustness and adaptation to a wide range of harsh environmental conditions. Although actinorhizal alders are routinely used for the revegetation of derelict lands (e.g. metalliferous mine wastes), little research has focussed on how anthropogenic contaminants (heavy metals, naphtenic acids, and chloroaromatic hydrocarbons) affect the actinorhizal symbiosis. These questions are even more important considering that frankiae, in their saprophytic life cycle, are directly exposed to these soil contaminants.

My research program will focus on elucidating how actinorhizal alders and Frankia sp. adapt to such environmental stress. Through this knowledge, we will be able to understand the impact of human activity on these organisms which are ubiquitous in Canada, and tailor rhizodegradation or phytoextraction technologies according to the natural potential of the numerous combinations of alder species and Frankia strains that will be studied. Parameters studied will include organism (plant, microorganism) development and acclimation in the presence of stressors (and combinations of stressors), the proteome of Frankia sp. in such conditions, and finally, the catabolic potential of frankiae and alder rhizosphere microflora for hydrocarbons and natural recalcitrant compounds found in the environment (e.g. lignin, pectin, chitin). Finally, although a dozen Frankia strains are currently in culture, culture methods may benefit from improvements, and thus culture method development will be a secondary focus of my research program.","Advancement of knowledge","Universit� de Sherbrooke",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Microbiologie,Microbiologie
"Urodele amphibians (i.e. salamanders) such as the axolotl are unique amongst vertebrates in their ability to regenerate lost or amputated tissues. They can regenerate their limbs, tail, skin, jaws spinal cord plus other tissues perfectly following damage or amputation. They can regenerate the same tissue multiple times throughout their lives. This regenerative ability is not limited to fetal or newly hatched/born axolotls as in other vertebrates. The fact that they have been used for hundreds of years to study regeneration and pattern formation clearly indicates that they represent an ideal model organism in which to study the paradigms of complex tissue regeneration in vertebrates. One of the most intriguing paradigms of tissue regeneration in axolotls is that they achieve regeneration by a process of cellular dedifferentiation rather than using reserve stem cells. Understanding how these organisms can achieve this cellular dedifferentiation would represent a major step in our quest to understand how epimorphic regeneration is accomplished. New technical developments on cellular transfection and transgenesis in axolotl tissues are allowing investigators to address the role of specific genes during the regenerative process for the first time in its long history. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP-2 and BMP-7) and the homeobox containing gene Msx-1 have been selected as candidate genes with the potential to mediate cellular dedifferentiation. These genes were selected because they were shown to either mediate cellular dedifferentiation in cells grown in culture or to mediate some level of regeneration in other systems. This grant proposes to determine whether these genes are responsible to mediate cellular dedifferentiation in axolotls. Recombinant viral vectors, transgenic axolotls and microarrays will be use to dissect out how these genes can influence differentiated cells to dedifferentiate and return to a pseudo-pluripotent cell type and then start proliferating and migrating to finally give rise to a regenerated structure.

"This research deals with the influence of climate warming and enhanced UV-B radiation, two major environmental stressors, on communities of marine phytoplankton (microscopic algae). We will examine the influence of increasing temperature in the Arctic, associated with reduced ice cover, on the cell viability of phytoplankton that may be harmed by the rapid increase in light in their environment. We will also test the combined influence of warming and enhanced UV-B on phytoplankton from Antarctica and in subarctic Quebec, by using controlled experiments in outdoors mesocosms (2 m3 containers filled with local seawater). A number of these mesocosms will be exposed to increased temperature with or without enhanced UV-B simulating local ozone depletion. Since increased temperature should favor enzyme-based repair mechanisms, we hypothesize that warmer temperatures will help local phytoplakton communities (or more resistant algal groups) support the increases in irradiances (including UV radiation) associated with warming in polar environments. We will also examine the outcome of these treatments in terms of changes in phytoplankton community composition and bio-diversity to assess how warming and UV-B are transforming the communities at the base of trophic food webs in marine polar environments. This information will also be useful for satellite ocean colour applications, which are being developed for identification of several phytoplankton groups.

"The ability to pay attention to relevant information in our environment while ignoring irrelevant information is essential for our survival. Unfortunately, in some situations, the same selective attentional process can have negative effects on our lives. An example of this negative impact is observed in addictive behaviours. For instance, the fact that an alcoholic favours to pay attention to alcohol-related cues in the environment rather than to other vital information contributes to maintain his problematic behaviours. To study this effect, researchers typically use implicit measures for which outcomes are not controlled by the individual to avoid his or her subjective influence at that outcome. The most commonly used implicit measures also have an important inconvenience: they require the individual to perform an artificial task (i.e. a ""spot-the-difference"" activity). Since humans do not usually perform tasks while they are processing information in their day-to-day life, the results from these artificial tasks might not represent our natural attentional processes. A way to address this problem is to use an implicit measure more similar to natural exploration. This can be done by using equipment that measures an individual's eye movements. In this research proposal, with an eye movement monitoring device, scenes will be presented on a computer screen and participants will freely observe the presented images. Comparably to a natural situation, it will allow us to better understand what, where, when, and how long an individual pays attention to different parts of a complex scene. For example, how much time does a heavy drinker spend on bottles of alcohol when he is presented a bar scene. Another example of a measure of interest is how quickly he would disengage his attention from the bottle. These measures will be compared for participants with addictive problems and participants who are not affected by these problems as well as between different types of addiction (i.e., to cigarettes, alcohol, and gambling). The main goal of this research program is to help better understand attentional mechanisms oberved in a naturalistic situation in order to assure that current models of attention in addiction provide the most accurate description of the problem.

"String theory is a proposed solution to the many conceptual conflicts existing currently between different

branches of theoretical physics. The theory attempts to describe all natural phenomena around us in one unified

framework. This framework should then describe the physics of elementary particles(currently described very

successfully by the standard model of particle physics), as well as gravitational physics (described by Einstein

theory of general relativity), in a manner consistent with the basic postulates of quantum mechanics.



The last few years have seen a rapid development in our understanding of the logical structure of the theory.

The research proposed is aimed at extending this knowledge and applying it to the study of a vast array of

physical questions. Many such questions have plagued previous attempts to quantize gravity and to unify it

with the rest of fundamental physics. As such, these questions should serve as as yardstick for the success of

string theory in its ambitious goals.



Understanding the puzzles related to quantum gravity should be used to get a better grasp of the behavior of

gravity in unusual circumstances. One such arena is that of early universe cosmology, where applying string

theory will hopefully result in a qualitatively new picture of the physics. This is also the context most hopeful for a true test of the theory, namely an experimental one. Cosmology has become a very precise experimental science, and imprints of string theory may be all around us, waiting for us to become smart enough to decipher them!

"For over twenty years my research has been concerned with theoretical and computational studies of laser matter interaction physics. This program has been focused on three broad areas of theoretical and numerical investigations: (1) parametric instabilities and nonlinear laser beam propagation in plasmas, (2) particle transport and plasma fluctuations, and (3) high intensity ultra-short laser pulse plasma interaction. Spin-offs from these core subjects into biomedical applications and international collaboration involving 4th generation radiation sources have included collaborative studies in microfluidic cytometry and theoretical investigations of plasma physics of photoionized gases. The long-term goal of this research is advancement of our understanding of high intensity laser pulse plasma interactions. This knowledge has been continuously challenged by new technological advances in lasers, which enable explorations of new plasma regimes at relativistic energies and in highly compressed states of the astrophysical relevance. In the proposed research program I would like to enhance research activities of my group in areas related to intense femtosecond laser pulses and their interactions with different targets. Results of the proposed research program will advance developments of laser plasma accelerators, new sources of relativistic particles and x-ray radiation, and will contribute to physics of the laser fusion program. The main facility in Canada, which provides a focus for these studies, is the Advanced Laser Light Source (ALLS) at INRS, Montreal.

"The past decade has seen exciting progress of science and technology at micro/nanometer scale materials and devices. The progress has stimulated a resurge of research on mechanical behaviors of small-scale solid materials. Although traditional solid mechanics models (such as elastic rod, plate and shell models) have been widely applied to study simple mechanical phenomena of such small-scale materials, they cannot be applied to complex mechanics problems due to new features of surface forces and microstructures at the micro/nano scales. This has raised a major challenge to the solid mechanics community. 



Solid mechanics of deformable elastic materials at small scales are characterized by two new features : 1) high-order dependence of deformation energy and internal forces on deformation gradients; 2) effect of surface energy and surface forces. Inspired by the applicant's previous research expertise on surface force mechanics, MEMS (microelectromechanical systems)-mechanics, nanotube mechanics and gradient elasticity, the present proposal aims to develop new theoretical models for mechanical behavior of solid deformable materials at the micro/nano scales. This proposal mainly focuses on :

1. Elasticity with surface energy/surface stress

2. Elasticity with high-order dependence on deformation gradients 

3. Energy dissipation of materials with temperature effect.



The proposed researches will explore several key topics of small-scale mechanics of elastic materials, and could make a significant impact on the small-scale elasticity theories and their applications to micro/nano materials and devices.

"Garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) are sympatric with their prey. Tetrodotoxic newts (Taricha granulosa) have evolved tetrodotoxin resistance that allows the snakes to ingest toxic newts. Allopatric snakes are tetrodotoxin-sensitive. The level of resistance in snakes spans a wide range and roughly correlates with the toxicity of the newts. This system is thus a co-evolutionary arms race. Voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for the rising phase of the action potential in electrically excitable cells. Our previous research has identified up to four amino acid substitutions in the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel. These substitutions account for toxin resistance. Furthermore, the number of substitutions correlates with the level of resistance. The substituted residues are located within the pore-forming region of the sodium channel, which is an otherwise highly conserved region because of its critical function in ion selectivity and permeation. Although we have characterized the toxin sensitivity of the skeletal muscle sodium channel from four different populations of snakes (apparently representing nearly the full range of toxin resistance), we have yet to characterize the biophysical properties, including gating and selectivity, of these sodium channels. These properties may be particularly relevant to this system, since it has been observed that the maximum crawl speed of resistant snakes is slower than in non-resistant animals. To fully understand the implications of toxin resistance, and to elucidate the costs of the amino acid substitutions to sodium channel function, we now seek to study the biophysical properties of sodium channels from the four populations of snakes. Sodium channels will be expressed in Xenopus oocytes and their biophysical properties will be assessed using patch clamp techniques. We will study the voltage dependence and kinetics of channel gating as well as the selectivity and single channel conductance of snake skeletal muscle sodium channels. This study will allow us to determine whether there are biophysical costs to toxin resistance and will lead to a greater understanding of the structure/function relationships that control sodium channels.

"L-functions and automorphic forms underlie much of twentieth century number theory. The fundamental importance of these functions in mathematics is supported by the fact that two of the seven Clay Mathematics Million Dollar Millennium Problems deal with properties of these functions, namely the Riemann Hypothesis and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.



Virtually all branches of number theory and arithmetic geometry have been touched by L-functions and automorphic forms. Besides containing deep information concerning the distribution of prime numbers and the structure of elliptic curves and abelian varieties, they appear, for example in the twentieth century classification of congruent numbers, a problem first posed by Arab mathematicians one thousand years ago (which asks which integers are the area of a right triangle with rational sides), and show up somewhat mysteriously in relation to the Mahler measures of certain polynomials.



In spite of their central importance, we have only scratched the surface of these crucial and powerful functions. My research will focus on developing methods for understanding and computing with L-functions and automorphic forms. I am interested in finding higher rank automorphic forms, and in examining questions about how large can the rank of an elliptic curve get. I plan to develop probability models to study the behaviour of the Riemann zeta function, and of L-functions associated to higher rank automorphic forms. I will also implement highly efficient algorithms for L-functions in order to test my models.

"This proposal is concerned with the fabrication of a completely novel deep W light emitter, based on so-callec

semiconductor alloy nanowires. These structures offer unique advantages for efficient light emission,

originating from so-called confinement effects (""dielectric"" and ""quantum"" confinements), which provide for

ultra-high efficiency (and tunable o ~ ~ twpav~e~lentg th) UVc light sources. In this proposal we plan to work with

our industrial/governrnent partners to explore the utility of these sources in two areas: (a) for ultra-high

sensitivity dosimeter development, and (b) for replacing Hg-lamps to disinfect water. In the former case,

radiation-induced 'stored' charge (in proportion to the radiation dose), is release by a secondary stimulating

light source, triggering efficient W light emission - the detected and analysed signal providing a direct

measure of the radiation exposure. Since, the intrinsic background noise in the solar blind (UVc region) is very

low, when combined with the envisaged very efficient light emission, unprecedented low dose resolution

should be feasible, enabling enhanced safety and security. Regarding the W treatment of water, the Hg lamps

currently used pose an inherent risk, as Hg can potentially be released into the very water they are designed to

disinfect. Moreover, the lamps have relatively poor power efficiency, and are fragile. This contrasts with the

robust, efficient and safe solution we are proposing based on nanowires that can serve to efficiently treat and

secure our water. The projeet is built on our expertise for over a decade in nanowires and their applications,

and in conjunction with our partners, provides an ideal vehicle for training of HQPs in an areaof strategic

importance for Canada. In addition, we look forward to helping to bring this exciting new technology to

"This proposal responds to Canada's identified strategic need for improved performance and low cost remote infrared sensing systems better able to detect and respond to natural or manmade disastrous events. Such systems are suitable for responding to threats such as chemical warfare agents, as well as to tracking of storms and floods, for example. Key to improved performance is large arrays of sensors offering multi-wavelength high sensitivity (and low background noise) operation that enables specification and quantification of the threat, combined with high speed spatial imaging expeditiously locating the source of the threat. Current technology can not offer these features and moreover suffers from other problems such as problems with material preparation, polarization problems for requiring non-normal incidence, post processing degrading detector performance and high cost.

We propose a novel approach of using InSb-based alloy nanowires that overcomes all of these limitations and takes advantages of unique properties of these nanostructures to provide exceptional performance - namely, extremely high infrared absorption, tenability of wavelength response using alloying and size quantization, and characteristic ultra-fast carrier transport in such structures. This translates into high tunable response detectors with low dark noise, as evidenced by our recent work on visible nanowire photoconductive detectors with unprecedented response of 22 AAV - almost two orders of magnitude higher than comparable traditional structures. Using inexpensive nanowire technology one can envisage large area back gateable arrays of such detectors, as the backbone of future sensing and security systems. Working closely with our Canadian industrial partner, Kyoto Accord Technologies Inc., we look forward to bringing a potentially revolutionary new technology to fruition, and training highly qualified personnel in this exciting scientific and technologically important area.

"In order to compete with steel and concrete in biologically adverse environments the natural durability of most Canadian species must be enhanced through chemical treatment. Because of increased attention on the environmental impact of treated wood - the two main issues being the loss of metals from the treated wood in service into ground water, and the disposal of treated wood containing significant amounts of metals - there is an opportunity for alternative strategies involving thermal treatment and wood-polymer composites. Unfortunately, little is known about the fundamental chemistry and factors affecting the durability of Canadian wood species when subjected to these treatments.



The proposed research builds on previous studies of the fixation chemistry of alkaline copper preservatives which revealed that during fixation of the copper to the lignin from the amine solvent, changes occurred in the hemicellulose leading to cleavage of the acid containing functionality. Copper which combined with this cleaved acid was mobile and lost from the treated wood in service. Thermal treatment of wood cleaves the same acid units and is believed to be a key reaction step leading to enhanced durability and dimensional stability. This will be studied to determine how combinations of thermal treatment and lower concentrations of alkaline copper biocides can lead to a more leach resistant but durable timber. Parallel studies will also include non-metallic biocides. In addition, the research will explore combining, modification of wood by grafting monomers with suitable functionality onto lignin, with traditional alkaline copper treatment, to enhance copper fixation. Changes in the nature of the wood components will be examined using techniques including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, FTIR, electron spin resonance, while the durability and chemical fixation of the treated wood will be assessed using standard soil block methods and accelerated decay test methods. Loss of mobile copper will be studied using modeling techniques developed previously by the author.

"The objective of this research program is to understand how chromosomal domains are assembled from their constituent proteins, and to determine how the dynamics of these regions change in response to changing physiological conditions.  



Specific regions of chromosomes are assembled into specialized structures composed of DNA and chromosomal proteins.  Although chromosome structures are often viewed as static elements they are responsive to changing cellular conditions, and their locations can change.   Although components of chromosomal domains have been extensively studied genetically, biochemical studies have been limited because of the difficulty isolating chromosomal proteins in their native state bound to chromosomes.  Therefore, there are few examples where all the components of a given domain have been determined.  Even less is known about how these proteins assemble into specific structures and how these structures are regulated by cellular physiology. 



This program will initially investigate the structure and dynamics of one model chromosomal domain, called heterochromatin, in the simple unicellular fungi budding yeast.  I will make use of a novel method I have developed that allows my laboratory to purify pieces of chromosomes and determine all the proteins present on them. My work on heterochromatin will then serve as a launching point for investigations of other chromosomal domains.

"Rigorous mathematical techniques find more and more applications in specification and development of complex systems.  Automating the process of checking that the mathematics has been properly used is desirable not only in applications but in conducting mathematical research.  This leads to the grand idea of building a computerized verification system that represents all important mathematical knowledge and techniques.  For more than three decades, I have been involved in a project named Mizar that has attempted to build a modest, trial version of such a system. 

 

Mizar is based on a relatively rich formal language, designed by A. Trybulec, for recording reasonings (definitions, theorems, and their proofs). Mizar texts can be checked by the Mizar verifier and then included into the Mizar Mathematical Library.  The library is founded on set theory and at present consists of almost 1000 formally verified articles with about 50 articles added annually.  All components of the Mizar system evolve; the changes are driven by the needs of authors contributing to the library.  These contributions are of lasting value as the contents of the library is mechanically transferable to other representations and to some other proof-assistants. 

 

I propose to continue my participation in the Mizar project by contributing to the Mizar library.  In the next few years I would like to continue development of algorithmic graph theory in Mizar.  I will cooperate with two colleagues from our department who are interested in algorithms for recognizing special classes of graphs. I hope that after formalizing enough background material we will become able to employ the Mizar system in assisting original research.

"High levels of atmospheric particulate matter is a major concern for all major cities in Canada and worldwide.  In most densely populated and industrialized urban areas a significant number of episodes with poor air quality occur every year and there is consensus that air pollution has significant negative impact on human health and the environment. Furthermore it has been established that atmospheric particulate matter affects the radiation budget of the atmosphere and plays and important role in climate change. 



One of the main challenges in developing effective and cost efficient air pollution mitigation strategies is the difficulty of establishing quantitative relations between emissions and air pollution levels at specific receptor sites. This problem is extremely complex for secondary particulate matter, atmospheric particles formed in the atmosphere by chemical reactions of directly emitted trace gases. 



In this project isotope studies will be used to gain insight into the complex processes resulting in the formation of secondary particulate organic matter in the atmosphere. The project will combine measurements in the atmosphere with laboratory investigations. The results of these studies will improve our understanding of the consequences of emissions of volatile organic compounds into the atmosphere and thus help in developing effective and cost-efficient mitigation strategies.

"Long-term research goals have been to develop practical management tools for nonpoint source pollution including nutrient management and source water protection, and the identification of sources of pollutants and their spatial and temporal distribution. Development of such tools requires quantitative description of variable source areas and their relationship with soil, land use, topographic and precipitation characteristics of the watershed. The proposed research will involve development of approaches which will lead to the development of realistic phosphorus and nitrogen indices, estimation of set backs for land application of liquid manure, identification of pollution source areas and selection of  best management practices for maintenance and/or enhancement of stream water quality..



The proposed goals will be accomplished (i) through investigation of seasonal hydrology by quantifying seasonal variability in surface runoff, base flow, and tile flow in various physiographic regions of Ontario, (ii) by development of procedures to map surface runoff contributing areas in watersheds, (iii) by quantification of seasonal variations in soil hydraulic properties including their  relationships with hydrologic soil groups, (iv) by development of an improved procedure for classification of soils into hydrologic soil groups and  (v) by development of a variable source area model for small watersheds to target pollution sources. The results from this research will improve the predictive capacity of nonpoint source pollution and hydrologic models, and hence our capability to identify the spatial location of source areas, selection and evaluation of best management practices, such as vegetative filter strips, and improved procedures for development of P and N-indices. Application of the results from this research will certainly not be restricted to Ontario or Canada, but will have application in many parts of the world.

"Pattern recognition (PR) is a field of artificial intelligence, which involves the process of taking raw data and making a decision to assign a sample to a category or class. PR systems have been extensively studied by researchers for many years, in both theoretical and application aspects - the latter includes a variety of disciplines such as medicine, molecular biology, bioinformatics, genomics, proteomics, biometrics, security and manufacturing, just to mention a few. The essence of a PR system is to devise and evaluate an efficient classifier which is able to accurately classify unknown objects. Whether or not the classes are known, the recognition process is called supervised or unsupervised. In any case, devising a classifier requires the underlying objects be represented by means of features, typically, as multi-dimensional vectors, and the underlying classifiers are derived in terms of functions or algorithms on the corresponding multi-dimensional space. 

The main goals of this research proposal are to devise an efficient scheme for optimal clustering, which is capable of dealing with multi-dimensional data, and develop a robust linear dimensionality reduction scheme based on statistical properties of the classes, which is capable of achieving high accurate classification for a wide range of problems, while selecting the best subset of features.

Applications of the newly proposed methods will be pursued on various problems in bioinformatics, proteomics, DNA microarrays and microbial biofilms. One of these is to efficiently cluster time-series DNA microarray data using unsupervised techniques. Another problem that will be tackled using the proposed clustering methods is DNA microarray image gridding and segmentation. Protein-protein interactions will be studied in terms of finding important residues and energetic factors in interfaces, and which are correlated to classification of protein complexes and amino acids.","Information systems and technology","University of Windsor",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Analyse de formes et intelligence artificielle",Robotique
"This research program addresses a novel type of electronic function that occurs in  technologically relevant perovskites and that holds the promise for novel electronic material properties that can be tailored on the nanoscale.

The crystalline structure of perovskites allows for many technologically relevant properties such as high/tuneable dielectric permittivity, piezo-, pyro-, and ferroelectricity and the electro-optic effect. Recent interest has focused on tailoring properties at interfaces by misfit strain or heterovalent substitutions in artificially layered structures which lead to 2D-confined electronic properties The ultimate functional structure of a perovskite lattice is a 1D extended defect that e.g. occurs at the terminus of stacking faults where an excessive crystalline half plane is inserted or a half-plane is missing. These structures are one atomic void across, filled with dangling bonds and penetrate the crystal from one face to the other. They are individually addressable and have metallic conductivity that can be electrically switched to a semiconductor state. Despite their cross-section of only a vacancy within a highly insulating matrix, these dislocation cores provide unique properties that often govern the bulk in combination with high-aspect ratios, a thermal budget far above molecular switches and a high tolerance to chemical environments. Their structural and electronic interplay with the host crystal offers various degrees of freedom to tailor their properties and to create completely new materials for nanoelectronics. This research program in nanoelectronics/nanophotonics therefore addresses the characterization and understanding of one-dimensional extended defects in perovskites with a high potential for metallic nanowires, electronic switches and completely new electronic functions depending on the interaction of extended defect and host material. In cooperation with the existing institutes at INRS-EMT, in particular the laboratory for micro- and nanofabrication, we will exploit the technological potential of these novel electronic functions.

"The City of Calgary business unit for Waste & Recycling Services manages residential waste collection for

300,000 residential homes and operates three landfills and various community recycling depots, and is

expanding to provide a city-wide residential recycling service. Its focus is on taking action to protect Calgary's

environment, with the goal to recycle 80 per cent of waste by 2020. This strategic objective creates new

challenges in process and service management. Traditional and strategic planning methods are no longer

sufficient to manage this new dimension of size and complexity of services. Decision-making towards

collection services needs to be done more effective and efficient in order to accommodate resource and budget

constraints of the forthcoming years.

The main technical goals of the project are:

-Mining of data repositories for analysis of existing operational service performance patterns;

-Reuse-oriented system modeling and simulation for strategic planning of waste and recycling services (WRS);

-Trustworthy decision support for strategic service planning;

-Optimization of collection efficiency, and

-WRS business intelligence prototype development and its empirical evaluation.

The proposed project will be part of The Urban Alliance, a research partnership between the City of Calgary

and the University of Calgary. The business intelligence solution will be designed to allow customization to

increased transparency and more timely decisions.","Waste, waste management and recycling","University of Calgary",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Conception de syst�mes d'information","Technologie de l'information"
"Planning and re-planning for software product releases assigns features to releases such that most important technical, resource, risk, budget and stakeholder constraints and objectives are met. Release planning is a computationally and cognitively complex problem: The problem is hard to solve, but even harder to be formulated. 



Five extensions of existing planning methods are considered:

(i) Planning with flexible release dates,

(ii) Planning across products (system and product line release planning),

(iii) Resource-centric planning of releases,

(iv) Re-planning of product releases, and

(v) Non-linear release planning and re-planning.



Evolutionary problem solving combining the strengths of specialized optimization techniques based on formalized description of the problem with the guided involvement of human experts is the fundamental principle applied to all directions of research.

"Gamma rays from radioactive 22Na produced in stellar events are a highly sought-after target for space-based astronomy missions. Some models of Classical Novae (accretion in a white-dwarf binary system) predict the creation of prolific amounts of 22Na in the ejecta, leading to a potential observable in the characteristic 1.275 MeV gamma ray emitted. This gamma ray would then be a direct test of nova models, and a powerful tool in gamma-ray astronomy. The model predictions depend on the nuclear reaction-rate libraries for all reaction which produce or destroy 22Na in the stellar environment, the destruction of 22Na via radiative proton-capture, 22Na(p,g)23Mg being one of the most important. The value of this rate having a strong influence on the final amount of synthesized 22Na. Recently a new excited state was discovered in 23Mg which will contribute significantly to the reaction rate. This could alter the model predictions by a large amount. 

An experiment proposal at TRIUMF-ISAC to implant radioactive 22Na targets has already been initiated, resulting in two low-activity targets which are now being tested at the University of Washington, Seattle. We propose to use the intense low-energy proton beam there to measure the strength of the new 22Na(p,g)23Mg resonance directly, providing a new reaction rate for the nova models. An experimental beam-line has already been commissioned at UoW along with a joint TRIUMF-UoW built chamber. The present implanted radioactive targets will be enough to perform initial resonance strength measurements, but in order to complete the experiment we require to implant more targets of higher activity. 

This proposal is a joint collaboration between the University of Washington Center for Experimental Nuclear Physics and Astrophysics (CENPA) and the DRAGON group at TRIUMF. 

The DRAGON group are providing essential manpower and expertise to this experiment, lead by myself and Prof Alejandro Garcia of CENPA.

"The present research program pursues the development of methodological approaches to better understand and manage the dynamics of real-life problems characterized by the presence of several decision-making levels and significant uncertainty. 

On the methodological side, this research project is inspired by two main concepts. First, rather than following a monolithic perspective, it will elaborate methods based on a distributed decision making approach where complex decision problems will be split up into subsystems by exploiting hierarchical or temporal dependencies. Thus, one important expected contribution of this research will be the adaptation of existing mathematical formulations in order to model accurately the interactions between the different subsystems. Second, explicit acceptance of uncertainty invites us to consider robustness within our optimization objectives.

The proposed research covers two application fields, logistics and transportation situations, and healthcare management problems. Within the latter, specific attention will be given to location routing problems (LRP) where we aim to exploit the hierarchical relationship between the strategic (location of the depots) and operational (routes design) decisions. Moreover, uncertainty of inputs (demand) will be taken into account as well as the sensitivity of the models with respect to external parameters like variations of fuel cost. Within the healthcare management theme, we intent to design, dimensioning and planning the operating room activities by including simultaneous decisions concerning staff (surgeons, nurses, etc), patient flow, and material resources (logistics of sterile and non sterile instruments). Although each of these subproblems has been previously addressed independently, this research aims at developing an innovating integrated approach. 

Finally, the suggested problem decomposition strategy will enable to merge mathematical formulation and simulation techniques (Montecarlo, SAA) in a rather natural manner. Therefore, significant attention will be given to the relatively unexplored connexion between simulation and optimization.

"Abstract harmonic analysis evolved out of classical Fourier analysis. It is the study of locally compact groups and the various Banach algebras associated with them. Through unitary representations of locally compact groups, there are strong links between abstract harmonic analysis and operator algebras on Hilbert space.



Many theorems in abstract harmonic analysis - Leptin's theorem, for instance, or the celebrated characterizations of amenable, locally compact groups through their group and Fourier algebras, respectively, due to Johnson and Ruan - convey the strong impression of just being ""shadows'' of much more general - yet to be proven! - theorems about locally compact quantum groups: these are objects that include all locally compact groups and allow a Pontryagin type duality theory for non-abelian groups.



Unitary representions enable us to harness the vast and powerful theories of C*- and von Neumann algebras for the study of locally compact groups. Nevertheless, there are many natural representations of locally compact groups that are not on Hilbert space, and these representations give rise to operator algebras in a non-Hilbert space framework. Without the tools of C*- and von Neumann algebra theory at hand, seemingly elementary questions about those algebras turn out to be surprisingly intractable.



In the proposed research, we will go beyond the framework of groups and Hilbert spaces. We shall systematically develop abstract harmonic analysis over general locally compact quantum groups and advance our understanding of operator algebras on non-Hilbert Banach spaces. We expect to identify many classical results on locally compact groups as special cases of theorems on quantum groups, and we hope to lay the foundations for a theory of operator algebras on suitable non-Hilbert Banach spaces.

"The adoption of fibre to the home (FTTH) is shaped by many factors: cost of deployment, cost of equipment, cost of infrastructure, adoption of consumer products that drive bandwidth demand beyond competing technologies' (e.g., cable and DSL) capacity, and the client's ability to exploit FTTH services cost effectively to feed all bandwidth hungry consumer devices. In particular, the penetration of high definition television (HDTV) is pushing up bandwidth demand, as is increasingly video-based Internet content, with IPTV looming on the horizon. The willingness of consumer to subscribe to extremely high bandwidth services hinges on the capacity to feed the multiple televisions and computers distributed throughout a dwelling without pervasive, high speed LAN cabling. Current wireless standards such as 802.11 can cover an entire household, but do not have the requisite bandwidth for multiple, simultane-ous high-definition video and/or high bit rate Internet delivery. Ultra-wideband (UWB) has sufficient bandwidth (>500 Mb/s), but range that covers a room rather than a home. This project addresses the enhancement of UWB technology to achieve home-wide coverage at 500 Mb/s or greater. More importantly, we search for a systems solution that exploits the use of optical transport to gain technological and cost advantages, allowing service providers to bundle FTTH content delivery with in-home wireless distribution. Our aggressive goals for a breakthrough ten-fold extension of UWB range are particularly challenging given the regulatory environment. UWB signals are constrained to be extremely low power; in this way they can be accorded tremendously wide frequency coverage (3-10 GHz), and thus attain very high bit rates. Therefore systems must be designed for extreme power efficiency, while recognizing the importance of keeping cost low. We seek our power efficiency gains in pulse shaping to attain maximally-allowed transmission power, and in advanced RF and digital signal processing at the receiver. To keep cost low we will examine new optical sources and exploit the available PON infrastructure.","Communications technologies (satellites, radar, etc.)","Universit� Laval",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","R�seaux de t�l�communications","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"
"Future passive optical networks (PONs) for fiber-to-the-home must increase the bandwidth available on a per client basis to meet rising demand. To keep costs low, incoherent sources have been proposed for PONs using spectrum sliced wavelength division multiplexing (SS-WDM). These sources suffer from severe intensity noise, limiting the spectral efficiency and/or bit rate of SS-WDM systems.  Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) have nonlinear dynamic responses that can be exploited to reduce the intensity noise of incoherent sources, albeit with mixed results. In order to explore the SOA behavior, we use Monte Carlo techniques assessing the most important criteria in physical layer data communications - the bit error rate. Given the signal dependent nature of noise in optical systems, nonlinear interactions, and high bit rates, accelerated Monte Carlo techniques such as multi-canonical Monte Carlo (MMC) are required. Armed with accurate numerical models of SOAs and the MMC technique for simulating bit error rate, we will investigate noise cleaning for fiber to the home applications. These techniques are also useful for other dynamic, nonlinear optical systems. 

   The proposed research, however, is not only the creation of an analysis tool, but the exploitation of this tool to address today's important challenges in the deployment of high bandwidth communications to the home. Our focus on inexpensive incoherent source systems is motivated by industry's desire to have low maintenance, robust components adapted to the mass market access networks. Incoherent sources and SOAs are widely discussed in the literature for access networks; our system enhancement via noise cleaning has the potential for economic impact as fiber to the home (FTTH) achieves worldwide deployment over the next five to 10 years. A better understanding of the performance of forward error correction is also of commercial importance. Not only do we study solutions for passive optical networks for FTTH, we also propose spearheading exploitation of the infrastructure, standardization, and low-cost components developed for the FTTH market to radio-over-fiber optical feeders for wireless wide coverage or last mile communications.

"Blood vessels produce a number of substances that maintain the health of the cardiovascular system. The cells that make up the blood vessel wall (endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells) contain antioxidant enzymes and chemical antioxidants, including glutathione (GSH), that help ensure proper functioning.  Cellular GSH levels are high and this chemical is believed to make an important contribution to antioxidant capacity and vascular function.  However, there is not much known about the distribution of GSH in different types of blood vessels, or about the mechanisms by which it helps promote proper vascular function.  There have not been very many scientific studies that have specifically manipulated blood vessel GSH levels to study the consequences of too little or too much of this chemical, or how it interacts with other molecules in the blood vessels. The studies in this proposal aim to discover the distribution of GSH in different blood vessel types throughout the body, and to study the effects that lowering GSH levels has on the function of these vessels in controlling dilation and constriction of the vessels and the blood flow to tissues.  We will also determine what the relationship is between GSH levels, vascular function, and gene and protein expression of the blood vessels.  We will investigate how the blood vessels that have compromised levels of GSH respond to other stressors.  In addition we will study the effects of acute and chronic exercise on blood vessel GSH levels, and will examine the effects of exercise on vascular function and characteristics in blood vessels with compromised GSH levels.  These experiments will be accomplished by using a number of experimental models including intact rats, isolated blood vessels and isolated heart from rats.  Understanding the role of GSH in regulation of blood vessel function is important from a basic science point of view to understand the signaling systems that are important in determining the molecular composition and the functional characteristics of blood vessels in health and in dysfunction benefiting cell and vascular biologists directly.  Clinical researchers may translate it into many obvious applications that can directly impact the lives of average Canadians.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","University of Waterloo",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Physiologie et m�tabolisme des animaux","Biologie animale"

"Concern about the welfare of farm animals in individual housing has led to increased use of group housing but economic pressures result in large group sizes and high social density. Animal welfare standards limit group size or densities but there is controversy as to what these should be. Quantitative measures of social density (e.g. number of animals in a given area) assume that all animals are identical but animals differ greatly in how they respond to social competition. We know little about social strategies of farm animals kept at high densities and have few tools to ameliorate the effect of social competition. Social competition is usually thought to be regulated by dominance relationships, but social relationships between animals can be more subtle. Domesticated species normally live in groups and have evolved strategies to adapt to their social environment. We need to understand these social abilities and profit from them. In dairy production, animal welfare is most at risk for the milk-fed calf and the periparturient cow. Animal welfare concerns and economic pressures favour the use of group housing for these animals, but recent studies show deleterious effects of stocking density on access to resources. However, we remain largely ignorant of the nature of social relationships between cattle, or their abilities to ameliorate negative effects of social competition. The objectives of this proposal are to examine whether 1. intensively-housed lactating cows and milk-fed calves form affiliative social relationships based on spatial proximity, and preferred grooming or playing partners. 2. these affiliative relationships reduce the effect of social competition over resources. 3. cattle classify group companions as either dominant or subordinate or affiliate or competitor. 4. cattle are able to re-schedule their motivational priorities to avoid social competition. I will examine the distribution of agonistic and affiliative behaviours within groups of cattle in commercial conditions, and explore whether competition over resources is reduced in groups with a large percent of affiliative relationships. I will also explore the way that cows classify each other as either familiar/unfamiliar, dominant/subordinate or affiliative/competitor.

"The purpose of this research is to investigate essential algorithmic and mathematical properties of certain fundamental discrete structures, including Venn/Euler diagrams, Gray codes, nested recurrence relations, and polynomials over finite fields.  Of these structures, Venn/Euler diagrams will be most familiar to the general public.  Formally, a Venn diagram consists of n simple closed curves drawn in the plane with the property that each of the 2^n intersections of the interiors or exteriors of the curves is non-empty and connected.  If regions are allowed to be empty, then it is an Euler diagram.  There is a demand for software that will render ""Venn"" diagrams of populations in such a way that the area of each region is in proportion to the size of the underlying population.  Basic questions about when this is possible, and if possible, how to best draw the diagram from the users point of view, are still unresolved, although some progress has been made.  One goal of this research is to resolve these questions.



Other problems that will be investigated first arose in Hofstadter's famous book: Godel, Escher and Bach; namely determining properties of the recurrence relation Q(n) = Q(n-Q(n-1))+Q(n-Q(n-2)), with Q(1) = Q(2) = 1, and a plethora of related similar recurrence relations.  As an example problem, it is not known whether Q(n) is defined for all natural numbers n.



We will continue our work on discovering and efficiently implementing combinatorial Gray codes, which are lists of discrete objects in which successive objects are ""close"" in some natural sense.

"The goal is to improve the effectiveness of current project & construction management (CM) processes for a project's procurement and construction phases through the development of richer representations of its dimensions and application of state-of-the-art information technologies to create computerized environments to improve decision making and enhance insights into reasons for project performance. In pursuing this goal, realities of the construction industry are considered - e.g. highly variable educational backgrounds of personnel, diversity & uniqueness of projects & their context, large sets of heterogeneous data, a need for generality as opposed to a very narrow focus, etc.  Research objectives and guiding questions are: Objective 1: Interpretation of construction data using causal modeling and visual analytics - How can seasoned construction personnel express their judgement and experience about performance cause-effect relationships in terms of data collected for CM functions to search for supporting evidence? and, How can visual analytics be used to provide important insights into project performance, improve decision making and aid communication amongst project participants?  Objective 2: Creating an environment for formulating and evaluating alternative construction strategies: How can CAD and linear scheduling be combined to allow for the formulation and exploration of alternative construction strategies to enhance project performance? Objective 3: Profiling project context for risk identification, impact and mitigation - How can the profiling of project context assist in developing an accurate risk profile for a project? Three intersecting building blocks underpin the three research objectives: (i) representation; (ii) knowledge management; and, (iii) visual analytics and CAD. Research methodology components include use of large scale data sets, testing of concepts developed on actual projects, building on research by others, and use of state-of-the-art technologies.

"Small ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules have many essential and varied intracellular functions that affect the expression of genes in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. We have only recently become aware of the sheer diversity and number of these molecules in some eukaryotic organisms. It is a remarkable discovery that the majority of the human genome may in fact contain sequences coding for small RNA molecules rather than for proteins. In most organisms, however, we still do not know the identity or the intracellular function of these RNAs. A primary objective of my research program will be to characterize novel RNA molecules and to elucidate their specific cellular activities. We will also be examining the means by which these small RNAs are expressed from the genes that encode them. Small RNAs associate in the cell with protein molecules to form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Several of the best-characterized RNP complexes are also some of the most ancient biological structures known and their existence predates the divergence of bacterial and eukaryotic organisms several billion years ago. One such class of eukaryotic RNPs are called the small nucleolar (sno)RNPs. These complexes are found in both eukaryotic and archaeal organisms where they play an important role in the synthesis and function of ribosomes. Recent findings also indicate that these RNPs have other distinct and important cellular functions. Another important goal of my research is to determine the detailed mechanism by which these snoRNP complexes function in the process of ribosome synthesis and assembly. We will also investigate the evolution of these complexes by comparing their structure and function in distantly-related organisms. Towards this goal, I have chosen to examine these complexes in the group of unicellular eukaryotic organisms known as protists. In these studies, we will not only be striving to enhance our understanding of the structure and function of protein-RNA complexes, but also to obtain the knowledge required to manipulate these structures to perform novel and useful functions in organisms such as humans.","Not available","University of Lethbridge",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Acides nucl�iques",Biochimie
"Organismic evolution is an interactive process driven by the environment, with organisms adjusting to imposed change.  The task of the evolutionary biologist is to document how, and in what ways, the environment challenges the organism to adapt.  One example of an intimate and tractable relationship between organisms and environment is evident in the contact between feet and the substrate in animal locomotion.  Such an interaction can be explored at various levels, from the macro to the nano scale.  Gekkotan lizards (commonly collectively referred to as geckos) are well known for their highly developed adhesive system that permits them to scale surfaces such as glass with seeming ease.  The extreme strength of the bond, its ability to attach and detach repeatedly without wear or loss of capability, and its ease of engagement and disengagement, are critical factors that require deeper understanding.  Breakthroughs in investigative techniques have enabled us to obtain a better understanding of how these adhesive capabilities operate, and have led to broad-scale attempts to mimic these interactions synthetically, for applications that might benefit human exploitation.  Geckos are a diverse group, consisting of over 1000 species, about half of which either lack or possess only a very rudimentary adhesive system.  These ""non adhesive"" species provide avenues to investigate how the highly complex adhesive system of geckos arose, and under what environmental circumstances it was selected for.  Investigation of the evolution of such a phenomenon is useful because it both permits a direct appraisal of interaction between the organism and its environment (where the ""rubber hits the road""), and will provides insights into how best to mimic the system.  Gekkos have elaborated their adhesive system on several (as many as 10) occasions beginning at least 54 million years ago.  The degree of similarity of design in these various lineages allows  assessment of what is necessary and sufficient for the operation of such a system.  The thrust of this research program explores the fundamental plan of the system and investigates how we can mimic its structural and functional properties.

"This application proposes 3 distinct but complementary programs in volcanology.



1) Models for Melt Viscosity:   Viscosity is the most important physical property governing transport and eruption of magma. It is strongly dependent on temperature and composition and can change by 10 orders of magnitude during a single eruption. We published a model for the viscosity of natural hydrous silicate melts. I propose to release a second-generation model to extend the model's capabilities (e.g., including CO2, Fe redox, P-dependence). The resulting model will capture virtually all silicate melts found on Earth and other planets.



2) The High-Temperature Rheology of Lava Domes:  Volcanoes that produce lava domes commonly switch between effusive and explosive behaviour. Essentially, how easily gases escape from magma governs the style (i.e. explosive vs. effusive) and intensity of an eruption. We propose a series of high-temperature deformation experiments to establish the relationships between magma viscosity, porosity and permeability as they apply to lava dome-forming processes. We will also measure seismic velocities on the pre- and post-experiment samples under confining pressure, and with and without a pore fluid pressure. These data will facilitate analysis of volcano seismicity focussed at conduits and vents. 



3) Volatiles and the Ascent and Eruption of Kimberlite:  The unique aspect of kimberlite magmas is their high volatile contents. I am developing computational models for the thermodynamic properties of the fluid phase during adiabatic ascent and eruption of kimberlite.  The adiabatic expansion can be a reversible isentropic process or an adiabatic isenthalpic process (irreversible). These different adiabatic paths have consequences for the style, intensity, and duration of kimberlite eruptions.

"The mission of the Centre de recherches math�matiques (CRM) is to do research in mathematics and closely related disciplines and to provide leadership in the development of the mathematical sciences in Canada and worldwide. The CRM carries its mission and national mandate in several ways, notably through thematic semesters, extensive postdoctoral fellowship program, and an important publication program. This national mandate is complemented by a long-standing vocation of promoting research in the mathematical sciences in Qu�bec and Eastern Canada, notably through the support of eight research laboratories. While a lot of the research activities of the CRM members and their teams (including some scientific workshops) take place in the various host departments and therefore rely on the computers of these departments, an important fraction of them take place directly at CRM. 



The main objective of this RTI grant application is to update the computing equipment at the disposal of our graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, long and short-term visitors.



CRM has three types of users: (1) PDFs, graduate students and long- and short-term visitors of certain CRM members carrying their research physically at CRM; (2) PDFs and long-term visitors related to the thematic programs, and (3) workshop participants. This new equipment is necessary to replace outdated computing systems and to help us in our research mission. The main beneficiaries are the users of the first two types, doing research at CRM, while the workshop participants (who stay for a short period) will also use the facilities. A lot of highly qualified personnel being trained at CRM will benefit greatly from this investment.

"Mathematical reseach activities have dramatically increased over the last decade, acting on the course of reaseach in all human activities, as their applications now range from cryptography, web efficient search algorithms, decision-making policies and finance, to brain imaging, computational cell biology and quantum computing. Their applications to industry have increased accordingly. This proposal seeks the renewal of funding from NSERC to the CRM (Centre de Recherches Math�matiques),  at a moment where this investment is most needed.

       Founded in 1968, the CRM was one of the very first institutes in the world and the first in Canada to launch annual or semester-long ``thematic programs ''. These programs bring together several hundred scientists from around the world for intensive sessions running over a few months to work on cutting edge research questions in pure and applied mathematical sciences. The rapidity with which important scientific results are now disseminated around the world and assimilated by researchers is a direct result of the creation of these programs by the CRM. With its world-renowned thematic programming, and outreach activities, with 1,500 scientific visitors from around the world annually, and ten laboratories directly involving 195 researchers from nine major universities in Quebec and Ontario and several hundreds of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, the Centre de recherches math�matiques (CRM) is a major hub for the mathematical sciences in the world. The dual structure on which the CRM is built  -- top-level national and international scientific events operating in parallel with ten research laboratories --  is unique in the world. Every month, the CRM hosts in average four international workshops or conferences, eight colloquia in mathematics and statistics, and a hundred seminars on a wide variety of subjects. It has founded and inspired over the last decade many other organizations and one of the most performing NCE's in Canada. The CRM is a driving force in training, as well as in outreach to industry while remaining firmly rooted in the Canadian university system.

"Conservation biologists have long appreciated the importance of preserving the ability of organisms to adapt to changing environments.  Although generally viewed as a hallmark goal of conservation biology, little research has been conducted towards identifying adaptive genetic variation that contributes to a species evolutionary potential and ability to survive future environmental changes.  Until recently, our capacity to directly quantify adaptive genetic variation has been limited to a handful of model organisms studied under artificial conditions. The recent emergence of population genomics, which combines genomic technologies with population genetics theory, provides a framework for detecting genome-wide associations between segregating variation and fitness-related traits in natural populations.  My program will entail one of the first applications of population genomics for studying adaptive population divergence within a conservation context.  At a local scale, neutral and adaptive genetic variation will be used to designate conservation units between two sympatric ecotypes of the threatened Okanagan lake kokanee and to elucidate the genetic basis underlying their distinct reproductive behaviors.  Benefits of this research include identifying molecular markers linked to fitness-related traits for guiding stock assessment, long-term ecological monitoring, and evaluating management practices.  At the landscape level, genomic scans will be conducted to better understand the genetic basis of adaptation along an environmental gradient in a climate change sensitive species, the Common pika of British Columbia. As a high latitude country, current models predict Canada may experience higher than average warming, with significant implications for the distribution of native flora and fauna.  My research has the potential to be among the first to investigate patterns of variation at genomic regions influencing a species ability to respond to climate change.  In addition to the basic and applied insights gained from this overall body of work, my program has the benefits of bringing together a collaboration of academic and governmental scientists while providing extensive opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student training.

"Auditory researchers have long known that lip-reading is a normal part of everyday speech and that the integration of audio and visual channels determines our perception of the basic units of speech (i.e., phonemes). For example, if someone is presented with an auditory /ba/ and a visual /ga/, they will generally report an illusory percept of /da/. Similar evidence for audio-visual integration in the perception of vocal music has recently been found by the applicant. This evidence comes from experiments with stimuli that are highly controlled as well as more naturalistic experiments involving audio-video recordings of great vocal performers such as Judy Garland. Experiments in the first phase of the proposed research will use motion analysis and visually-based judgments of musical stimuli to characterize facial movements that are reliably associated with specific units of production in vocal music. Experiments in the second phase will assess properties and possible mechanisms of integration in vocal music with the aim of developing a preliminary model of multi-dimensional and multi-modal integration. This model would be of significant interest to music science and may be of importance to leading edge issues within cognitive neuroscience. Insofar as vocal music and prosody are based on similar components, this model may also be useful for advancing our scientific understanding of speech prosody (i.e., intonation). Finally, building on the work in the first two phases of this grant, a third phase of experiments will lead to a proof-of-concept for an innovative assistive technology. The technology would use a visual display (e.g., an iPod) to project either a close-up view of a singer's face or a point-light animation that captures the critical time-varying aspects of facial movement. The efficacy of the proposed technology to enhance the experience of vocal music in hearing impaired listeners will be tested.",Psychology,"Ryerson University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Syst�mes sensoriels et perception",Psychologie
"This project aims to explore cognitive and socio-ecological bases of ranging flexibilities in east Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus morio).  New findings on geographic variation in orangutans identify morio as the extreme of orangutan adaptation:  morio faces the harshest ecological conditions and is correspondingly distinct physically, developmentally, and behaviorally.  However, most morio data date from 20-25 years ago and while consistent with these findings, most are not of the quality needed to verify them and they suggest other distinctions.  These data may also reflect conditions that no longer exist.   Morio's habitat has since been transformed by natural disasters and human development, so many now survive in fragmented and damaged habitat or have been relocated into new areas inhabited by unfamiliar orangutans.  New studies are needed to address these limitations, and flexibility in ranging, i.e., the use of space, is a good place to start.  First, orangutan ranging is determined by cornerstones of their adaptation:  food, sociality, development, learning, and cognition.  Second, ranging flexibility is essential to cope with their food supply, which is extremely patchy in time and space.  This flexibility owes much to cognition but cognitive contributions to orangutan ranging have rarely been studied.  Recent research on primate spatial cognition could then enrich the study of morio ranging:  it offers models and methods for assessing bases for the flexibilities possible, e.g., the nature of mental maps and how travel routes are handled.  This project's main goal is to update understanding of normal morio ranging flexibility in relatively intact habitat, by extending study over five full years and by using cognitive as well as standard methods.  As opportunities arise, it may also contribute to assessing the limits of their ranging flexibilities via parallel studies of morio living in damaged habitat and relocated to new areas. Findings should enhance understanding of orangutan and great ape spatial cognition, of morio itself, and of geographic variation in orangutans.  Findings should also assist conservation by, e.g., clarifying morio agendas and habitat use and the effectiveness of relocations.

"Given the importance of reading in our everyday life and the increased need to understand reading disabilities such as dyslexia, it is critical that we gain a better understanding of how the brain's hemispheres communicate when we read.  With this understanding more effective intervention strategies can be developed to better help people who struggle with reading.

For most of us, it is likely that the left hemisphere of the brain is performing much of the work during reading.  However, recent evidence suggests that the right hemisphere does have some reading ability.  It remains to be determined just how this ability affects reading efficiency.  For instance, does the right hemisphere facilitate, inhibit, or have little effect on the more efficient left hemisphere processing?

My research investigates this question using a procedure that measures whether two hemispheres are better, worse, or not different from one.  Moreover, the procedure lends well to tests of people who are slow readers, so can be used to map ways in which communication is normal or abnormal in people with a reading problem.  To date, the answers that I have obtained suggest that competent reading is associated with the gradual shutting down of processing by the right hemisphere, and that this does not consistently happen in people with a reading disability such as dyslexia.

My plan is to continue to identify factors that affect how the hemispheres communicate when people read.  Does the communication differ if you are a new reader compared to an experienced one?  Does it differ if you have a reading disability?  What are text factors that promote the hemispheres to work together or work against each other?  My goal is to map the dynamics of interhemispheric communication so that we can better help people who have difficulty reading.

"Partial differential equations (PDEs) are ubiquitous throughout the sciences and applied sciences. Because analytical solutions are rarely possible, the practical importance of accurate and efficient numerical methods for PDEs cannot be overemphasized. There has been a great effort made to develop numerical methods for many important classes of PDEs. These efforts focus on finding solutions in one, two or three spatial dimensions. But problems involving general differential equations also arise on general manifolds, such as two-dimensional curved surfaces or one-dimensional curved filaments.  For example, in material science one might wish to examine phase change of a material on a curved surface. In biological modeling, one might study wound healing on skin, or the evolution of a pattern on an animal coat. Computer graphics and image processing also frequently use PDEs on surfaces; for example, they might use such methods to place a texture on a surface or restore a damaged pattern on a surface such as a vase. Despite the widespread occurrence of PDEs on curved surfaces there is still a need for a systematic approach for accurately computing the solution of general PDEs on general surfaces.



Our research develops and analyzes algorithms for solving PDEs on surfaces.  The focus is on methods which (1) apply to general surfaces, (2) apply to general PDEs, (3) are accurate and efficient, and (4) are simple in the sense that they treat different PDEs as uniformly as possible and make use of existing techniques and software.   It is anticipated that the methods obtained under this research grant will have a strong potential to enable researchers and end-users to numerically investigate realistic models of general surface processes with great accuracy.

"A fundamental concept in evolutionary biology is that of effective population size (Ne). Ne reflects the size of an ""ideal"" population experiencing the same rate of random genetic change per generation as the actual population under study (census size N). The concept is central to conservation genetics because of its links to inbreeding depression, population persistence and evolutionary potential. Effective sizes are typically much smaller than census sizes. Fluctuating population size over time, unequal sex ratio and variance in life time reproductive success contribute to the low Ne/N ratios commonly observed in nature. Such low ratios suggest that populations may be subject to the loss of genetic diversity even when census sizes are still relatively large. Knowledge of the mechanisms that affect Ne, its relationship with N and with gene flow (m) and their interaction is thus critical for understanding the mechanisms that affect biodiversity.  My long term research goals are to understand the processes that affect Ne and m, and their relationship with N, and to identify the conditions under which Ne can be used to predict population persistence. I intend to compare patterns of Ne and m across sympatric populations of fish species to disentangle the influences of life history and environment. I also plan to reconstruct ancestral population dynamics; I will compare historical changes in Ne and timing of ancestral population bottlenecks across species and will relate this information to geo-morphological processes and past climatic changes (Quaternary). The goal is to determine how similar current and historic patterns of Ne and m are for populations of coexisting species and to examine the roles played by life histories and ecologies vs. geomorphology and climate in producing these patterns. Fieldwork takes place in two contrasting temperate systems: A northern ""Salmonid"" system, and a Patagonian system. Both are found in post-glacial landscapes. The northern salmonid system includes Atlantic salmon, brook trout, and Arctic char in Newfoundland and Labrador. The Patagonian system comprises two widely distributed native Patagonian fishes. In both cases, species are found in a variety of ecological settings.","Conservation and preservation","Dalhousie University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","�volution et �cologie","�volution et �cologie"

"This research program is concerned with the development of speech production abilities in infants and young children. Developmental scientists have established that infants are born with an impressive ability to discriminate one speech sound from another. The infant's developing speech perception abilities are shaped by the language(s) spoken in the infant's home environment. During the first year of life babies develop a special sensitivity to speech sound categories that are critical for understanding the native language. An infant's ability to produce speech sounds also develops rapidly during the first year. By the middle of the first year most babies can produce speech-like babbling sounds. It is not known whether the characteristics of these early speech sounds are shaped by the language environment however. This research will address the following questions: Do infants with Arabic speaking parents produce babbling sounds that are different from the sounds produced by babies with French- or English-speaking parents? Do toddlers with good speech perception skills go on to develop more accurate speaking abilities than toddlers with poorer speech perception skills. The research will help us to understand why some children develop accurate speech articulation skills more rapidly than other children. The research may help us to develop more effective treatments for children with speech disorders.

"Recent innovations in technology have generated research questions which cannot be adequately  addressed with classical statistical techniques.  My area of research is the development of novel techniques for use when classical methods may not be appropriate. For example:

a) Spectrophotometers are used to measure the absorption of light at over a 1000 different wavelengths, and investigators have proposed to use these measurements to characterize a sample. Unfortunately, classical multivariate statistical techniques break down in the presence of such high dimensional data. While techniques have been proposed to address this, they often ""overtrain"", that is they underestimate the true errors of misclassification. I propose to study methods which bias estimates towards zero. This will result in classification rules which better estimate the true errors of misclassification. 

b) Remote image recordings of an area of interest have allowed investigators to collect data in places only previously dreamed of. Unfortunately however, when these recordings are returned to the lab for analysis, the investigators often then ask ""What Now?"".  I am proposing to use stochastic processes to extract more information using current sampling techniques, and also a new sampling strategy which will be able to extract more information than current methods about an area of interest.  In both cases, the proposed techniques have the potential to improve precision and reduce the costs of evaluating video recordings.

c) Automated monitoring devices have been developed which record the movement of objects through an enclosed space.  We have developed a new detector which provides more information than previous detectors, including the number, speed, and size of objects.  We are now proposing to build statistical models that allow this new detector to be used as a management tool. While this detector and the methods we propose to develop are widely applicable, we are most interested in their potential to provide cost effective monitoring of small animal populations and we are currently seeking collaborators for this venture.",Environment,"Fraser Valley",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Statistique appliqu�e","Statistique et probabilit�"
"The work covered by this grant involves using nuclear methods (Mossbauer

spectroscopy and neutron diffraction) to investigate magnetic ordering

in a variety of materials. While none of the materials that we will be

studying has any direct application, the knowledge gained will provide a

deeper understanding of magnetic phenomena and so permit the development

of improved materials for applications.



Two examples of these are hard magnets and magnetic refrigeration. Hard

or `permanent' magnets are widely used in the electric motors and small

speakers present in all of those portable power-tools and iPods. Better

performance translates into smaller, more powerful and cheaper. Magnetic

refrigeration is a potential new technology for large-scale air-conditioning

and liquefaction of natural gas that avoids the use of ozone depleting freons.

We are working to understand how these materials work in an effort to

improve their efficiency.



We are also developing ways to improve the experimental techniques that

we use to study our materials. This takes us to extremely low temperatures,

large magnetic fields and special sample holders that allow us to work

with challenging materials.

"The Canadian Neutron Beam Centre (CNBC) is a Major Resource for materials research, operated by the National Research Council of Canada at Chalk River Laboratories.   This laboratory is centred around five neutron scattering instruments, each with a capital replacement value of about $5M.  The neutron instruments are attached to the NRU research reactor, which is operated by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL).  Over 80% of neutron instrument time is devoted to research projects led by external users:  scientists, engineers and students from over 50 departments in universities across Canada, industries, government labs and more than 100 foreign research institutions.   Canadian academic research carried out at the neutron beam laboratory spans disciplines such as condensed-matter physics, chemistry, biophysics, materials science and engineering.  Neutron scattering experiments provide unique and important knowledge about materials at the molecular or nano-structure scales.  Access to the neutron beam laboratory is granted on the basis of scientific merit.  Proposals are reviewed by subject-oriented committees, whose members are drawn from the Canadian Institute for Neutron Scattering (CINS).  CINS represents over 400 individual members and 15 institutional members.  It oversees the management of NSERC MRS funds by the CNBC, supports outreach events (such as a neutron scattering summer school), and provides leadership and advocacy for funding proposals associated with this Major Resource.","Advancement of knowledge","McGill University",3,"MRSIF ","Major Resources Support Program - Infrastructure","Physique de la mati�re condens�e","Physique de la mati�re condens�e"

"The human auditory system is able to use binaural cues to determine sound-source locations and to increase speech intelligibility in noise. Due to technical limitations, however, hearing-aid technology has traditionally been applied independently to the two ears. Such independent operation  can lead to the disruption of the binaural cues that are important to hearing. Within the next few years, however, it is anticipated that advances in low-power digital signal processors and wireless technology will enable the linking of hearing aids and other ear-worn devices. A hearing aid with this capability will be much more than today's acoustic amplifier: it will become a true binaural hearing system. Unfortunately, little is known about how to adapt the features common in today's hearing aids in a manner that will achieve an effective binaural hearing system. 



This research program will develop signal processing algorithms for future binaural hearing systems. The systems targeted by this work are bilaterally fit ear-worn devices that are designed to operate in unison through a data link. The long-term goal is to offer perceptually relevant improvements in sound quality and speech intelligibility compared to similar devices that have no binaural capability.

By examining scanning patterns using eye movement monitoring and by observing neural activity as revealed by magnetoencephalograpy, we will outline whether the knowledge we acquire about particular items, such as information about items and where they are located, creates subsequent obligatory changes in how we process that information and what brain regions we use to process such information.  This research will demonstrate that we are guided by our experiences, whether or not we are even aware of those previous episodes.

"The distribution of plant species is largely determined by their ability to cope with the environmental conditions in different habitats, such as the availability of nutrients, water and light. A plant's ability to acquire these resources is in this respect an important and well-studied trait. Equally important, but less studied, is the plant's ability to avoid losses of the once acquired resources, i.e., its turnover rate. Resource acquisition is closely related to growth rate, resource loss with life spans of leaves and roots. There is generally a reverse relationship between growth rate and organ life span: fast-growing plants usually produce short-lived leaves and roots. This projects concerns basic questions about ecological and evolutionary mechanisms with respect to turnover, but it is also potentially important for understanding the consequences of changes in land use and climate.

One aim of this project is to consolidate our current understanding about the consequences of a given turnover rate for the species' performance in different environments, and put this in a broad theoretical context. There is detailed knowledge about the importance of many traits in specific situations, but the adaptive advantage of certain turnover characteristics at a general level is still often based on assumptions, not mechanistic understanding. The models to be developed in this project will help to fill this gap. 

Another main aim is to increase our knowledge about below-ground processes, which still is limited. This is the case especially in natural ecosystems such as wetlands, which cover large areas in Canada's North. Recent evidence shows that life spans of fine roots in such ecosystems, which often is assumed to be very short, may be much longer. Belowground prodution often exceeds the above-ground one, and fine root turnover is considered as an important part of total carbon cycle in these environments. To understand it fully we need to know more about root mortality pattern and factors controlling it.

"Elevated levels of heavy metals close to mines, smelters and refineries, such as found around Sudbury, Ontario, reduce the growth of plants and can even be lethal for them. The resulting soil exposure leads to  erosion and emissions of metal-containing dust in the surroundings. Phytoremediation, i.e., planting vegetation on the affected area is a cost-effective means to mitigate the environmental effects of metal-contaminated sites, but the used plants have to be able to tolerate heavy metals, and frequently also drought, as metal-contaminated sites tend to have poor soils. Effects of low levels of metals on plants under field conditions are not well known, but it has been shown that physiological changes occur, possibly interfering with the plant's ability to tolerate other stresses such as drought.

 

In the current project the effect of low levels of heavy metals on plants' ability to cope with drought will be investigated, using plants with contrasting metal tolerances. Metals are known to influence physiological and morphological traits associated with water uptake and water regulation, but experiments directly testing the interactions of these two stresses are rare. In this project the effects of mixtures of heavy metals as found in Sudbury area soils on water uptake and regulation in white birch and red maple under different watering regimes will be tested. As water use of plants is an important factor affecting soil moisture, the feedback of metal effects on soil water will be investigated at ecosystem level. The investigation will be conducted using trees, as they are important for sustainable long-term restoration of ecosystem functions, for stabilizing the soil and for reducing wind speeds and dust development. The study will deliver information about the interactions between phenotypic and genetic responses to heavy metal stress, and drought, and information to what extent observed problems of deciduous trees in restored areas are related to metal-drought interaction. The results will help long-term planning of mitigating environmental effects of mining industry and possibly help finding tolerant genotypes useful for restoration activities.","Environmental impact of economic activities (including agriculture)","Laurentian University of Sudbury",2,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","�cologie v�g�tale","�volution et �cologie"

"The aim of this research is to develop a deeper understanding of the network of proteins that allows bacteria to perform chemotaxis and thermotaxis, that is to sense and swim towards food or a preferred temperature, respectively. We propose to develop such an understanding through closely coupled experimental approaches and computational modeling. As all signaling pathways within living cells must function in the context of fluctuating thermal environments, our efforts may reveal universal mechanisms by which cells ensure faithful signaling. From a human health perspective, chemotaxis by bacterial pathogens has been implicated in infectivity and maintenance of disease, and thermotaxis may be implicated as well. Since the chemotaxis/thermotaxis network is widespread and well conserved among bacteria, but is not shared by humans, the pathway presents a potential target for the development of future antibiotics. In addition, as all signaling pathways within living cells must function in the context of fluctuating thermal environments, our efforts may reveal universal mechanisms by which cells ensure faithful signaling. This Research Tool and Instrument Grant (RTI) will allow us to develop microfluidic devices to quickly quantify the output of the thermal sensory network. Development of these devices may lead to diagnostic instruments with impact on human health and disease.

"Magnetic resonance (MR) is a powerful imaging modality in which spatially encoded raw data is acquired from the object being imaged. A computer program then processes these data to obtain the desired tomographical, or cross-sectional, image. In the past two decades, numerous data acquisition methods and image reconstruction techniques have been introduced to ""efficiently"" collect the necessary raw data and to generate diagnostic and informative medical and non-medical images. A variety of methods were required to target different MR applications (like imaging of stationary or moving objects, vascular imaging, measuring flow, and imaging specific tissues) and to overcome MR limitations (like lengthy acquisitions, artifacts from subject motion, and blurring). 

    In MR imaging, the relationship between the imaged object, the data acquisition, and the information content of the reconstructed image is a complex process where exact knowledge about this relationship has been only established using numerical and limited non-numerical information. This complexity arises because of unknown object's content, unpredictable motion artifacts during imaging, and unpredictable dynamics such as perturbations, external noise and disturbance. Hence, the information gathered before or during the imaging process is never complete, sharp or comprehensive.

    In this research, we will investigate the use and suitability of relatively new informational logic, known as fuzzy logic, to incorporate linguistic expert knowledge into novel data acquisition and reconstruction algorithms for MR. We anticipate that fuzzy logic can address some MR current limitations and can provide accurate information in a shorter time. Our proposed study is directed towards experimental and computational techniques that can be used to prevent and/or minimize artifacts during imaging; rather than looking at post-imaging solutions.","Biomedical engineering","University of Calgary",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie biom�dical","G�nie biom�dical"

      Actuellement, le temps moyen de traitement pour marquer une image binaire de 4 m�ga pixels est de 0,085 seconde et celui requis pour optimiser les param�tres de l'algorithme de marquage est de 539 secondes sur un cluster Beowulf de 68 coeurs. Le d�bit moyen estim� pour une base de 10 000 images est de 0,084 image/seconde. Le transfert de cette technologie pour un usage industriel n�cessite un d�bit de l'ordre d'une (1) image/seconde, ce qui sera possible avec l'utilisation du calculateur demand�. Cons�quemment, nous devons adapter nos algorithmes sur des calculateurs sp�cialis�s pour le traitement massivement parall�le, plus performants et peu co�teux pour l'industrie. L'utilisation industrielle de cette nouvelle technologie sera possible seulement dans le cas ou le traitement est effectu� en temps r�el sur un calculateur d�di� de haute performance.

SUMMARY OF PROPOSAL FOR PUBLIC RELEASE (Use plain language.)

This plain language summary will be available to the public if your proposal is funded. Although it is not mandatory, you may choose to

Electro-static discharge (ESD) of electrical energy into sensitive integrated circuits is one of the known reliability problems. In spite of significant progress during last couple of decades, ESD still affects production yields, manufacturing costs, product quality, product reliability and profitability. Today ESD impacts productivity and product reliability in virtually every aspect of integrated circuit (1C) manufacturing and assembly. The cost of damaged devices range from few cents for a simple diode to several hundred dollars for a complex hybrid populated with complex ICs. Some experts estimate overall annual cost of ESD in electronic; industry in excess of few billion dollars.

There are several significant ESD protection challenges in 90nm and 65 nm CMOS technologies. The Principal Investigator intends to do research on some of these challenges. One of the key design challenge is to minimize the parasitic capacitance associated with the protection circuits so that they can be utilized in high frequency circuits. Furthermore, since the frequencies are going up with scaling, the devices to be protected are becoming more susceptible and the capacitive loading requirement is becoming more and more restrictive.

Systems on Chips with multiple power supply islands add to the complexity of ESD protection. Researchers have observed ESD related failures when such SoCs are stressed through Charged Device Model (CDM). Depending on the point of contact and location of the charge, the ESD dissipation may take one of the several paths. Some of these ESD energy dissipation paths have higher impedance resulting in ESD failures.

"Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) content in integrated circuits is increasing irrespective of its application. In microprocessors up to 90% of transistors are in embedded SRAMs. Therefore, embedded SRAMs influence various aspects of Systems on Chip (SoC) such as power, energy, yield, quality, and reliability. In this proposal, several aspects of SRAMs will be investigated. 

Power consumption of embedded SRAMs is growing rapidly with integration. The aim of this research component is to realize SRAMs capable of hibernating data at 0.4V without compromising the operational speed. Investigations include devising architectures such that all but the access word during read will have the reduced supply voltage. The research will also investigate theoretical as well as implementation issues of realizing low power, low voltage SRAM circuits.

The signal charge at digital storage elements (SRAMs, flip-flops) has become highly susceptible to upsets by energetic particle (alpha particle) strikes owing to reduced supply voltage and shrinking transistor dimensions. By imparting unwanted charge in silicon, these particles can flip the logic state of a node, thus disrupting the circuit functionality. This phenomenon is referred to as a single event upset (SEU) or a soft error. The soft errors related failures in time (FIT) can exceed the FITs caused by all other failures combined by a few orders of magnitude. In particular, SRAM is more prone to soft errors due to its lower node capacitance. In this research we will investigate techniques for soft error mitigation. 

Technology scaling makes transistors increasingly susceptible to process variations. Transistors with smaller dimensions such as in SRAMs exhibit a higher susceptibility. Therefore realization of robust SRAMs is becoming increasingly difficult. Such issues also give rise to asymmetric cell behavior, offset voltages in sense amplifier, etc. In this research segment we will investigate circuit techniques to mitigate these issues, and enhance SRAM robustness.

"Membrane traffic describes the flow of both lipids and proteins between intracellular compartments. This process is crucial for the establishment and maintenance of the distinct nature of these organelles and is mediated by small vesicles. In addition, proteins synthesized in the cell can be extruded via the secretory pathway where vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane. Such secreted proteins can be taken up by neighboring cells as is the case with the pigment melanin. This pigment is synthesized in specialized cells called melanocytes and stored in a unique organelle called the melanosome. These organelles are transported to the cell periphery and by as as yet unidentified mechanism transfer their melanin to neighboring keratinocytes. The melanin serves to protect the keratinocyte DNA from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation. The exact mechanism whereby melanin is transferred from melanocytes to keratinocytes is unknown and it remains unclear if melanin or melanosomes are actually transferred. This application proposes to use a two-pronged approach to address this problem by (i) examining factors known to be involved in this process as well as by (ii) taking an unbiased approach by setting up an RNA interference-based screen. Both approaches rely on the observation that failure of the B16 melanocyte cell line to release melanin results in the accumulation of the pigment within the cells and such ""darkened"" cells can be selectively isolated from a mixed population of cells by flow cytometry. The screen will involve expression of random interfering RNAs, sorting of the melanin-accumulating cells by flow cytometry and then using a bioinformatics approach to identify the protein that was knocked-down. It is anticipated that this approach will identify components involved in many different phases of melanosome biology as any defect that prevents their movement or release will lead to darkened cells. Proteins identified by the screen or by the more directed approach will be validated by a variety of biochemical and cell biological methods. In addition, this screen can be adapted to the study of other secretory pathway processes making it widely applicable to the study of many aspects of protein secretion.

"Life on earth depends upon gas exchange between shoots and the atmosphere.  Carbon dioxide entry produces new carbohydrates in photosynthesis, and water evaporation cools the plant and the planet.  These gases move through stomata which are epidermal valves made up of two guard cells around a pore.  Stomata make gas exchange possible since valve opening and closing allows carbon dioxide entry while minimizing water loss.



Despite their importance, how stomata themselves form is just beginning to be understood.  We know which cell divisions are critical for Arabidopsis stomatal development, but do not understand how cell proliferation stops in time to allow stomata to differentiate.  We have identified quite a few relevant genes, but know almost nothing about whether classical plant growth regulators - which affect almost all developmental processes in the plant - also act during stomatal development.  We suspect that cross ""talk"" between developing guard cells generates the functional and beautiful mirror-like symmetry of the valve, but we need to characterize more fully the molecular pathway that might be involved.



These areas are the focus of the research proposed as the questions are central and novel, and we have key preliminary data and testable models.  The first advances our work showing that transcription factors are needed to end divisions in the pathway.  We will test whether these factors directly regulate the expression of cell cycle genes whose gene products interact and cause cell cycle exit.  The second area exploits our finding that mutants with altered hormone flow show defects in stomatal patterning, shape and pore formation.  The third goal is to define how a receptor kinase might translate signaling between young cells into intracellular gradients that establish valve symmetry by determining where cell walls are made.  This work is part of our long-term goal to understand the cell and molecular biology of the entire pathway of stomatal development.

"Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) allows a user to formulate a query in one language and to retrieve documents in one or more languages. The current research proposal concerns a unified approach of query translation and document translation with an application on morphologically complex languages such as Arabic, Chinese, French and English. The query translation approach translates queries into document languages using available linguistic resources; while the document translation approach translates the retrieved documents into the target language. 

This research proposal is based on four major parts and objectives, as follows:

1. Investigate on query translation using the dictionary-based approach. An investigation on the disambiguation of polysemous lexical items using word co-occurrence graphs will be pursued. Furthermore, efficient algorithms for the transliteration of cognates and named-entities using a hybrid spelling and phonetic information will be developed. 

2. Design and implement efficient methods for translating large sets of retrieved documents. Three methods based on rules, statistics and their combination, respectively, will be explored. Special data such as named entities, dates, numbers and currencies will be investigated carefully with both rule-based and statistical approaches. Furthermore, linguistics information, such as syntax and morphology are needed in the pre-processing step. Arabic and Chinese languages suffer from the problem of word segmentation. 

3. Continue the research on exploiting comparable corpora for bilingual dictionary enrichment and machine translation. One of the major bottlenecks in the development of portable and robust NLP applications with broad coverage is the lack of linguistic resources.  

4. Develop efficient and comparative algorithms for query expansion using an ontology-based approach and relevance feedback in both pre- and post-translation phases.","Information, computer and communication technologies","Universit� du Qu�bec � Montr�al",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Technologie de l'information","Technologie de l'information"

"The application of textile composites in engineered products has been driven by their ease of formability from an original two-dimensional planar shape to complex three-dimensional shapes, along with the combination of light weight and high stiffness and strength. These attractive material behavioral aspects have made textile composites of interest in a number of industries including aerospace, sports, and automotive. Among different types of textile composites, woven fabrics are sometime used as an interlaced assembly of weft and warp commingled yarns composed of reinforcing fibers and thermoplastic matrix material filaments. An in-depth understanding, and consequently improvement, of the forming processes applied to woven fabrics requires proper material modeling and simulation tools. Such models and tools can be vital during the optimization of forming processes to avoid costly replacement or reproduction of manufacturing components such as molds. This project primarily aims at developing a modeling and optimization tool to improve the mechanical 

performance of woven laminates in a continuous roll forming process used in the production of customized slab profiles in bridge decks. To avoid severe mechanical failures at the end of the process, trial and error methods are commonly used to vary the manufacturing parameters such as the number of forming stages and the shape of forming rolls. The proposed tool aims to approach the problem with a systematic robust design-of-experiments methodology where finite element simulations can replace the experimental trial and errors which are often costly. The main expected outcomes are to reduce cost, time, and human resources needed for the enhancement of the mechanical performance of roll formed parts. The advantages of the new bridge decks compared to traditional timber decks include more durability with an estimated 75 years service

life, less weight per surface area, superior fatigue resistance, and easier installation/replacement.  L'utilisation de composites utilisant des renforts tiss�s pour le d�veloppement d'applications haute performance repose grandement sur la facilit� qu'offrent ces mat�riaux � se conformer � des formes tridimensionnelles complexes, sur leur faible densit� ainsi que sur leur rigidit� et r�sistance �lev�es. Ces caract�ristiques attrayantes ont d'ailleurs permis aux composites textiles de s'imposer dans plusieurs secteurs incluant l'a�rospatiale, les sports et loisirs et l'industrie automobile. Parmi les diff�rents types de composites disponibles utilisant des renforts tiss�s, plusieurs sont disponibles sous la forme de tissus dont la trame et la cha�ne sont compos�es de fibres de renforts et de filaments de matrice thermoplastique. La compr�hension d�taill�e et 

l'optimisation des processus de mise en forme de ces mat�riaux n�cessitent cependant le d�veloppement de mod�les et d'outils de simulation. De tels mod�les et outils sont essentiels � l'optimisation des proc�d�s afin d'�viter les co�ts �lev�s de remplacement ou de modification de l'outillage.

"Woven fabrics are often defined as an interlaced assembly of weft and warp yarns commingled of fiber and matrix materials. The ease of formability from an original two-dimensional planar shape to complex three-dimensional shapes, along with the combination of light weight and high strength and toughness, has made woven fabric materials of interest in a number of industries including aerospace, sports, and automotive. It is widely understood that an optimal and robust design and material selection of woven fabrics is not possible without the prediction of the mechanical behavior of these materials using appropriate models.  In turn, to add to the reliability of a fabric model, the following should be taken into account. First, it is essential to account for potential material defects (often referred to as uncertainties) that cause apparent non-repeatable responses. Second, during forming processes, combined loading conditions are normally encountered (multi-objectivity) and the fabric model should be able to represent the material behavior in such conditions. The development and integration of a multi-objective fabric model under uncertainties is still an ongoing research and is the focus of this work. 



To perform the research, a robust multi-objective optimization technique will be employed to identify a meso-fabric model in a finite element code. This model will then be used to study the individual and combined effects of uncertainties in the mechanical response of select woven fabrics under different deformation modes and strain rates. For large scale forming simulations, an equivalent modeling framework will be employed to reduce computational cost. Finally, the numerical tool will be used in conjunction with a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) technique to facilitate robust material selection of the woven fabrics. The final goal is to build a comprehensive decision aid system that can be applied in the design of high-performance components made of woven fabrics, enhancing particularly the reliability of these components.

"Novel Roles for Amino Acid Neurotransmitters in Proliferation of Striatal Neuronal Progenitors.

        The number of neurons comprising the mammalian brain results from proliferation in germinal zones, migration to the target site, and developmental cell death. In the forebrain, diverse neuronal subtypes are produced from an initial simple neuroepithelium lining the ventricles. The striatum is a major component of the forebrain, involved in control of movement and motivation. It is composed of a heterogeneous group of projection neurons and interneuron subtypes. Unlike the other major component of the forebrain, the cerebral cortex, little is know of factors in the embryonic microenvironment that control production of specific striatal neurons. Separate striatal neuronal subtypes arise from 3 distinct germinal zones: the lateral, medial and caudal ganglionic eminences (LGE, MGE, CGE). We discovered glutamate and GABA, the major amino acid transmitters of the adult brain, play an important novel role in modulating proliferation of striatal neuronal progenitors. 

        We propose glutamate and GABA selectively modulate production of striatal neuronal subtypes produced in different germinal domains. We developed 3 models to address our hypothesis. i) We will use pharmacological antagonists to block specific receptor subtypes in the embryonic brain and quantify neuronal subtypes in the adult striatum. ii) We will also quantify the effect of in utero drug exposure on proliferation in germinal zones. iii) We will selectively culture proliferating neuronal progenitors derived from the LGE, MGE, and CGE, and use pharmacological agonist/antagonists, or genetic manipulation to determine effects of glutamate/GABA receptors subtypes on proliferation. Finally, we will explore how the activated neurotransmitter receptor signals the novel proliferative message to the nucleus. Our work provides important novel information on normal forebrain development. It is also relevant to disease states, including fetal alcohol syndrome, toxic exposure to anesthetics and anti-eplieptics, and the ischemic cerebral palsies.

"Motivation for the research stems from the recognition of the fact that safe and secure water supplies are vital for the health and prosperity of Canadians. The proposal addresses the major target area ""Safety and Security"" with a special focus on reliable water quality ""event detection"". The main objective of the proposed research is to detect and classify (diagnose) water quality failure events by developing, implementing and finally integrating an intelligent online monitoring system into existing water distribution networks. The proposed system will be capable of detecting and classifying the cause of water quality failure, based on streams of data obtained from embedded microfluidic lab-on-a-chip (LOC) sensors and operational SCADA systems. The major technical contributions of this research will be presented in five phases: (1) study hydraulic connectivity

in distribution system and subsequent effects on water quality; (2) develop a prototype software system for an improved detection and diagnosis of a water quality failure event; (3) develop automated updating mechanism using regular monitoring data (obtained from historical database) as well as newly collected data obtained from LOC sensors (specifically designed and fabricated in this project); (4) develop online water quality monitoringprocedures, and (5) develop a protocol for system integration. This research will provide an integrated system for utilities to detect and diagnose potential water quality events by identifying the cause of anomalous conditions identified from online sensory and operational data. This will minimize the cost for system operation and maintenance since human intervention for measurement will be minimized.

Long term objective of this research is to enhance the reliability of water quality monitoring and consequently the confidence of operators and their ability to manage the distribution system without compromising its integrity. For the successful execution of this project a multidisciplinary team is assembled that consists of a group of four researchers who have diverse and in-depth experience in water quality modeling and monitoring, soft computing and intelligent systems, sensor and LOC technology, and data acquisition.",Water,"University of British Columbia",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Qualit� de l'eau, pollution","G�nie de l'environnement"
"The long-term objective of this research program is to facilitate risk-informed decision-making process for Municipal/ Provincial/ Federal/ agencies to allocate financial resources and capital investments for the water infrastructure sector, and enhance reliability and access to safe drinking water for Canadians. The research program will develop new knowledge and understanding on integrated management of water supply systems. Models, techniques and tools developed in this research will be based on sophisticated mathematical/ statistical techniques. The research program encompasses four major themes that include: 1) risk-based prioritization of source waters; 2) climate change impacts on distribution system reliability and distributed water quality; 3) optimization of water quality monitoring/ sampling locations in a distribution network; and 4) dynamic risk modeling for water quality failures in distribution networks. 

Access to 'safe' and 'affordable' drinking water is a basic human right. Though the problem is partially resolved in most of the Western World, it still poses serious threats due to increasing pressures like, population growth, industrialization, and resource depletion/ degradation. Many international agencies/ organizations (e.g., Bonn Charter, WHO guidelines) emphasize the need for proactive risk management of water supply systems. The main feature of the proposed research program is to focus not only on the end-of-pipe verification and implementation of management control systems (i.e., regular water quality monitoring) but also emphasizes the need for evaluation of risks at all points throughout the water supply system. In the longer run, the proposed risk management framework will also improve water utilities' abilities to address water quality issues stemming from security-related events.

A pool of highly qualified personnel (HQP) will be trained over the course of the proposed research program. The research program will prepare HQP for water sector, and will also help them to develop analytical and problem solving skills that will be useful for their placement in engineering industry in general.

"The extraction of 3D geometric building information from high-resolution electro-optical imagery is becoming

a key element in numerous geospatial applications. Indeed, producing 3D urban models is a requirement for a

variety of applications, such as spatial analysis of urban design, military simulation, and site monitoring of a

particular geographic location. Almost all operational approaches developed over the years for 3D building

reconstruction are semi-automated ones, where a skilled human operator is involved in the 3D geometry

modeling of building instances, a time-consuming process. Further, such approaches usually require stereo

image pairs, image sequences, or laser scanning of a specific geographic location to extract the 3D models from

the imagery. Finally, with current techniques, the 3D geometric modeling phase may be characterized by the

extraction of 3D building models with low accuracy levels.

This research aims for a fully automated 3D Structure Detection that copes with imaging of arbitrary viewpoint

variations, clutter, and occlusion using monocular panchromatic air/spaceborne images. The system will be

designed to deal with complications arising from complex shapes and interference due to the close proximity of

urban city buildings. There are numerous applications for a consistent reliable system of extracting geometric

information from remotely sensed imagery. Some of these include: urban planning and airport hazard analysis,

civilian emergency mitigation, natural disaster management (flooding, earthquakes, and landslides), military

surveillance (active engagement of force, counter terrorism and peace keeping measures, and for statistical

"The objective of this research is to design and develop a free ranging outdoor navigation system that incorporates trajectory, position estimation and control. The free ranging navigation systems are not bounded to follow specific predefined paths, therefore, suitable for outdoor or dynamic environments. This work will combine the readings of several sensors including vision, GPS, dead reckoning, and rangefinder to develop a hybrid navigation platform. This research will be performed by generating mathematical and computational models of scene objects or features using optical, physical, geometrical, and statistical information of the scene. These models are then updated by incorporating particular sensors' readings. The decision of what sensors' readings should be included in updating each model will be made automatically. This decision will be made according to the model properties, surrounding environmental information, time, and weather and lighting conditions. The suggested approach can improve the reliability of intelligent navigation machines by enhancing their accuracy and robustness, and reducing (or bounding) the long-term positional drift. Free ranging navigation systems have a wide range of applications from industrial such as transporting systems for mines and harbors, to entertainment such as zoo guiding robots.

"Electronic toll collection, as a major area of application of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) concepts, requires an intelligent radio network, which, in addition to reliable communication between fast moving vehicles and fixed access points, can identify and locate each vehicle in a multi-lane free-flow busy highway and track it during its fast passage through the interrogation region. Current toll and traffic monitoring systems in North America utilize multiple antenna per lane, installed on a gantry, to cover multiple road lanes. Currently, to meet the coverage requirements and to prevent interference a number of fixed antennas with different types of pattern are used in various configurations. However the performance of such fixed beam antennas will degrade with the varied propagation environments at different sites and due to vehicular traffic in an unpredictable manner. Roadside antennas, which do not require gantries and are much easier to maintain, are preferred. An adaptive reconfigurable antenna system can meet the aforementioned requirements and offers the highest performance in a most cost-effective manner. 

     The research proposed is aimed at investigation and development of a new intelligent active antenna concept that can be installed on the gantry or on the roadside and can optimize the beam to identify and distinguish fast moving cars in different lanes and track them individually. The proposed antenna array system will be capable of suppressing unwanted interference and will maximize the antenna gain towards a particular car. A particular challenge is the existence of unwanted reflected and diffracted waves from road, road side installations, and the other cars. To make the proposed technology attractive and industrially relevant and practical, the cost and complexity of the system should be minimized. The proposed research will develop a novel adaptive array technology which can meet the demanding requirements of interest to ITS community in general and the supporting industry in particular. In addition, new computational methods for fast analysis and design optimization of such systems, including complex environmental effects will be investigated.

"Authentication of information is arguably the most important security goal in modern electronic communication systems. Receiving a message on a computer terminal needs assurance that the message is coming from the claimed sender and it has not been tampered with. This assurance does not exist for most communications over the Internet today.  Inadequate security for identification of users, devices and services, and authentication of messages has made attacks such as identity theft and fake websites, a major security concern. Authentication systems provide assurance for communicants about entities involved in the communication and the messages that are exchanged. Authentication systems must also meet the challenges resulting from the advancement of technologies and the introduction of new services. Applications such as social networking and instant tele-conferencing require secure authentication in dynamic groups.  Multimedia data is produced at very large volumes and multimedia authentication systems have special requirements such as tolerance to small changes in data.   A growing concern in authentication systems is users' privacy and the assurance that users' data cannot be later used to breach their privacy.

A useful authentication system must be provably secure and also sufficiently efficient to be acceptable by the users.   The two most important approaches to proving security are information theoretic security that provides an unlimited and everlasting security guarantee, and computational security that guarantees security for the   lifetime of the data. The main advantage of this latter approach is the efficiency gain. In this  research program we will,  (i) explore,  model and analyze  the problem of entity and message authentication in today and future communication systems, and  (ii)  construct  efficient authentication systems with provable security that satisfy extra properties such as privacy of the users, or tolerance to small changes in multimedia data that are byproducts of commonly used multimedia processing. The proposed program will produce highly qualified graduate students equipped with knowledge of theoretical and practical information security.

"Highly oscillatory integrals play a major role in various applications, e.g. quantum chemistry, image analysis, electrodynamics, computerized tomography and fluid mechanics. Traditional quadrature rules have failed in the accurate and rapid numerical evaluation of these integrals. Few classes of extrapolation methods are well suited for highly oscillatory integrals, notably the D and G transformations. However, the application of these methods can be extremely difficult and require a large amount of calculation. The development of new algorithms for the computation of these methods for highly oscillatory integrals is critical. 



In molecular structure calculations, the primary task is the computation of molecular multi-center integrals, which are extremely difficult to evaluate rapidly to a chemically significant accuracy, especially for large systems and when using the physically better motivated exponential type functions (ETFs) to represent atomic orbitals. Despite the efforts of many researchers, no efficient algorithms have been proposed for the evaluation of these integrals over ETFs. Improvement of the computational methods of molecular integrals over ETFs would be indispensable to a further development in computational studies of large molecular systems. 



Accurate evaluation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) parameters is of great interest in chemistry, biology and solid-state physics. The computation of these parameters presents severe analytical and numerical difficulties, especially when using GIAO (gauge including atomic orbitals)-ETFs. These difficulties arise from the operators associated with these parameters, which lead to extremely complicated integrals. Although some ab initio calculations of NMR and ESR parameters, using numerical differentiation or straightforward numerical integration, have been reported in the literature analytic rather than numerical differentiation or integration has to be used in such calculations.

"The thermodiffusion phenomenon, also known as thermal diffusion or the Soret effect (in liquids), describes the coupling between a temperature gradient and the resulting mass flux in a multi-component system. While thermodiffusion in gases is being widely investigated and is well explained by the kinetic theory, thermodiffusion in liquids has also given rise to increasing scientific and engineering interest in recent years. For example, it has been postulated that thermodiffusion is integral to the analysis of the composition distribution in oil reservoirs. Some researchers have speculated that the thermodiffusion of biomacromolecules may play a role in the origin of life. The proposed research firstly focuses on the continual investigation of solutal thermal convection during the growth process of Silicon Germanium (SiGe) material using the Travelling Solvent Method (TSM). Secondly, the research aims to further extend the study of thermodiffusion convection in an inhomogeneous porous cavity. With respect to the former portion of the proposed research, TSM is a relatively new and promising technique for the production of high quality semiconductor materials. Achieving high purity SiGe semiconductor material is a pivotal aspect of the production of photodetectors and solar cells. We propose to use magnetic fields in order to suppress buoyancy convection, thus allowing for a detailed study of thermodiffusion in Si/SiGe system. The obtained numerical/theoretical results will be compared with undergoing experimental research at Dalhousie University. With respect to the latter part of the proposed research, the investigation will be extended to study fluid flow, heat and mass transfer in inhomogeneous porous media filled with different binary hydrocarbon mixtures at high pressure. The molecular and thermodiffusion coefficients for different mixtures will be estimated as function of the temperature and concentration at each point of the finite element grid. Then the numerical results will be compared with the experimental setup that is currently at the Universite de Pau in France.

In particular we propose to develop novel algorithms and data structures for making next generation sequencing technologies cost effective and useful for structural variation detection, copy number variation detection and SNP detection towards developing a new generation of genomics based diagnostic technologies. We also propose to work on some foundational algorithmic problems involving strings and sequences. In addition, we will aim to develop novel algorithms for biomolecular network analysis, RNA structure and interaction prediction and small molecule analysis, going beyond the QSAR methods we have been working on. Our approach will be based on rigorous mathematical modeling of the problems which will then be tackled through algorithms with performance and correctness guarantees. The techniques we will use are typically based on approximation algorithms, randomized algorithms, combinatorial optimization, data structures and computational learning theory.","Information, computer and communication technologies","Simon Fraser University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Algorithmes,"Technologie de l'information"

"The use of software is now part of our everyday life and the process of developing it has gone through several technological changes. Of the various research directions that have been studied, automation of Development and Maintenance Activities (DMAs) is the one that has gathered the most support. Automation helps reduce the complexity of such activities; for example, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approaches concentrate the development and maintenance effort on models and use automated transformation mechanisms to generate/modify code. Many factors limit the automation of DMAs. One of the most important ones is the lack of reliable and widely applicable knowledge for many activities. The lack-of-knowledge problem is amplified by the complexity of the DMAs. 

Starting from these facts, our research objectives are to propose alternatives for DMA automation that address/circumvent the lack-of-knowledge and complexity problems. More specifically, we will investigate the use of metaheuristic techniques that consider some DMAs as optimization problems, we will develop interactive visualization techniques that allow experts to compensate for the lack of knowledge by providing contextual knowledge in the context of complex tasks, and we will propose techniques that manage the uncertainty inherent to the lack of knowledge.

"The proposed research is concerned with the study of fundamental research problems that would pave the way for designing the next generation of engineering systems that integrate conventional control system design with Fault Detection, Isolation, Estimation, and Accommodation (FDIEA) objectives, thus enabling the system to function for extended periods of time, safely, efficiently, with more autonomy, and less interruption in service. FDIEA problem is of crucial importance in safety and mission critical domains such as space and aerospace applications. In certain other domains, such as chemical/petrochemical, manufacturing, power and communication networks, safety to some extent, but mainly economics is the main motivation for having such capabilities.  Yet environmental concerns and the desire for fuel efficiency drive the governments requirement for new vehicles to have On-Board engine Diagnostics capabilities (OBD II). 



I have an established and mature research program that I run in the Diagnostics and Control (DCL) lab at SFU. Over the years, many highly qualified research personnel have been trained in this lab. We have worked with government organizations, as well as various industries such as NASA Lewis (now Glenn), NASA Ames Research Labs, Canadian Space Agency (CSA), GM Research Lab, Imperial Oil Ltd., BC Hydro, PowerTech Labs,  among others, on real world engineering applications. My greatest and most noteworthy practical contribution came to fruition in 2004, when the model based engine diagnostic strategy that I initiated over 1993-1994, and worked with GM researchers for a number of years after, was finally rolled into production. Despite our success in technology transfer, many challenging and open research problems remain to be addressed. This proposal is about some of the fundamental unresolved research problems in model based fault diagnosis.

"As a liquid continues to cool below its melting temperature, it will eventually harden, either by a phase change to a crystal, or by a continuous dynamic slowdown to a glass.  The many examples where the competition between nucleation and glass formation is present, from physical properties of biological materials to the manufacture of ceramics and optical lenses, underscore the importance of understanding the connections between the two processes.  The goal of my research plan is to unify our understanding of these two opposing processes, using computer simulation as our primary tool.  The research will be important for controlling aspects of material fabrication, for understanding why some liquids crystallize, while others tend to form glasses, and for improving our ability to control properties of atomic clusters.  We will also apply the various theoretical and computational techniques to systems of a biological nature, e.g. viral capsids, in hopes of learning how to harness the inherent power of self-assembly present in these systems for technological development.  The research is designed to develop in students an expertise in the important areas of nucleation and glass formation that finds application in materials science and engineering, as well as the food and biological sectors.

"Dynamic dislocation-defect analysis (DDDA) is a newly developed method [1], the basic notion of which is to use the mobile dislocations, which permits plastic deformation in crystalline matter, to sort out the types of obstacles it encounters in its passage through the crystalline matrix.  By testing various well- defined microstructures, the specific thermodynamic signatures have been delineated. To transform this methodology into a predictive R&D technology, the DDDA must be correlated to microstructural kinetics: (a) by quantitative modelling as a function of time and temperature during alloy heat treatment and/or metal processing and (b) by correlation to the size and distribution of the evolving particles to the strength and ductility of that metallurgical state. This work primarily entails modelling of known mechanisms with respect to the DDDA signatures using a simple spreadsheet format to interpret the atomic mechanisms responsible for the development of specific microstructures. The boundary conditions for this modelling of the growth and dissolution of precipitates are provided by previous and on-going work in this laboratory and supplementary studies from the literature.  This modelling was performed by two summer undergraduate assistants and in discussion with my plasticity theory colleagues at Waterloo University concluded it would be a good project for their coop-intern program.  Negotiations are in progress.The long-term objective of this proposal is to complete this compilation in sufficient cases of industrial interest such that the application of this new technology will spread to every R&D centre in the world. We believe that, with the our current up-dating of the servo-hydraulic system and software, the microstructure of any metal sheet product can be assessed to examine if its material processing history can be optimized to result in enhanced properties of structure-strength-ductility. To globally communicate this knowledge, workshops and materials-testing training courses will be offered on a cost recovery basis.

"The plastic processing industry is one of Canada's key industrial sectors. It is well aiming to reduce its dependency on fossil fuel based plastic and actively researching on renewable resources consistent with the concept of sustainable development and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. In order to maximize the economic and environmental values, the industry wants to find new ways to convert polysaccharides into foamed products to replace numerous applications of foamed polyvinyl chloride. This project will focus on minimizing the use of polyvinyl chloride in automative applications. In particular, it will examine the foaming potential of fungal modified polysaccharides, interfacial and bulk adhesion properties with hydrophobic polymers and resultant molecular architecture to partially replace polyvinyl choride foam. Additionally, it will also investigate the reheology of the biobased formulations, their processability on standard thermoplastic equipments and performance evaluation within stringent automotive standards. The project is supported by a automotive product manufacturer in Canada. The team includes principle investigator with a range of expertise in biomaterials, foamed and reinforced biocomposite materials and automotive part manufacturing. It will involve the training of 1 graduate stydents, two postdoctoral fellow and at least 2 undergraduate summer students.","Manufacturing processes and products","University of Toronto",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Rh�ologie et transformation","G�nie chimique"

"Imaging devices have a wide variety of applications in diverse fields such as movie making, enforcing quality control and invasive/noninvasive medicine. Challenges in building high quality imaging devices are in achieving high sensitivity to low light intensities, low power consumption (especially in mobile applications) and high resolution. Nanotechnology offers many pathways to potentially address these challenges. This proposal focuses in depth on one such pathway that uses silicon nanowires. The fundamental physics of the nanowires points to a potential improvement in imager performance and a reduction in power consumption, there by making them cost effective. The major advantages with silicon nanowires are that (i) they are more easy to integrate with exisiting silicon infrastructure when compared to other exotic nanomaterials and (ii) they become a direct bandgap material at sufficiently small diameter, greatly improving light absorption of silicon. The proposed work involves developing models to simulate real life paradigms, design optimization and fabrication that ultimately permit verification of silicon nanowire imagers.

"The objectives of this research program is to design and demonstrate single wavelength and tunable vertical cavity surface emitting semiconductor laser (VCSEL) diodes for the mid to far infrared wavelength (IR) range (2-50 microns) and to demonstrate a pilot photonic sensing system for trace gas analysis and single molecule detection using these new sources. The availability of electrically pumped low-cost VCSELs in the mid-IR wavelength region could be a major breakthrough for laser based sensing applications. Real-time trace-level gas detection is an area of fast growth with applications in such diverse fields as medical diagnostics, process control, national security, and environmental air quality monitoring. For example in order to effectively monitor the green-house gases to control global warming, there is a strong need for a sensor system for detecting and measuring trace gases in the atmosphere, especially those released by iron and steel processes, semiconductor foundries, auto emissions and livestock in farmlands. Similarly for the medical field, sensitive detection of the breath gases has the potential of becoming a non-invasive diagnostic test of components of blood that have characteristics of specific human diseases or dysfunctions of important human organs. Mid-Infrared (MIR) laser spectroscopy is an extremely effective tool for detection of various molecular trace gases which have fundamental vibrational absorption bands from 3 microns to 10 microns. Laser based sensor systems also have inherent advantages compared to chemical detectors such as rapid data collection and analysis and non-contact approach for measurements in hazardous environments. Demonstration of the new low cost VCSEL sources which can be arranged in two dimensional arrays will help to revolutionize this market and allow for portable sensor systems.

"We are starting to unravel the mechanisms of embryonic development, but most of the genetic steps that shape the development of functional neural networks in the embryo are still largely unknown. In order to gain insight into the genetics of neural development this proposal aims to study two zebrafish mutants that affect the development of the nervous system. Zebrafish have become a pre-eminent genetic model for the study of vertebrate development because of several features such as external fertilization, large clutch size, ease of care, optical transparency as well as an ongoing genome sequencing project. In addition to these features, we have developed techniques to record the activity of identified neurons in the intact spinal cord of the embryo during the earliest stages of development. 

          We will study two zebrafish mutants which affect the development of motor behaviours. First, we will study the mutant ennui, which affects the development of the neuromuscular junction. We have shown through electrophysiology that these embryos swim more slowly because of reduced efficiency at the neuromuscular junction which stems from a decrease in acetylcholine receptor clustering. We propose to genetically map this mutation and identify the gene that leads to this phenotype. Second, we will study the mutant touch�, which show a marked reduction in sensation of touch, whereas the motor responses to their sensory modalities are not affected. Our goal is to use electrophysiology to characterize the physiological deficiency in this mutant and identify the mutated gene with genetic mapping and molecular biology methods. 

           The molecular events during development have been shown to be rather well conserved between vertebrate models of development; as such our results in zebrafish should provide insights into the mechanisms of neural development for all vertebrates.

"Phase transitions form a field of statistical physics that remains extremely difficult mathematically. One of the difficulties lies in the fact that a transition, like the transformation of liquid water into ice, may occur only when the number of particles (the molecules of water) is extremely large. Mathematicians choose to model this situation by actually taking the limit as this number of particles goes to infinity.



For physical situations that are taking place in a plane, for example at the surface of a solid, there are essentially three approaches to the problem. (Working in two dimensions is a suitable choice because of the powerful tools availble in this dimension.) The first is based on models defined on lattices where all interactions are specified. One would say that it is an atomic description. The second called conformal field theory supposes that some symmetries occur somewhat miraculously at the critical points where the phase transition takes place and uses this symmetry to push farther the analysis. (This symmetry is observed experimentally.) Finally a recent mathematical development, called the stochastic Loewner equation, has provided tools to show rigorously some of the results of the two previous approaches. 



None of these approaches is currently complete by itself and the proposed research project pursues the collective work leading, hopefully, to a cohesive theory. It will concentrate in bridging some of the gaps between the three approaches.

"The proposal focuses on important energy, environment and economy issues (see http://www.iseee.ca/) related to the in situ upgrading of heavy oils. One Collaborator, Pedro Pereira, is the Director of AICISE, the Alberta Ingenuity Center for In-Situ Catalysis at the University of Calgary (see http://www.aicise.ca/). One of the main research themes of AICISE is ""Catalysts and adsorbents for In situ upgrading of heavy oils"". This research theme within AICISE investigates the use of catalysts and adsorbents for the overall objective of performing In situ Upgrading.  This integrated project targets research on ""Design and methods for delivering catalysts into the bitumen and heavy oil reservoirs exploited under enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods, including catalyst synthesis, characterization, screening for reactivity tests, stability and recyclability of them under conditions producible in situ""

In parallel to the leading-edge experiments performed in AICISE, new multiscale modeling methods and software are being developed that extend from quantum mechanical studies of chemical reaction mechanisms, through molecular dynamics including the effects of the surrounding condensed phase environment, to the mesoscopic treatment of coupled chemical reaction networks. The Applicant and two of his Collaborators (Andreas Koester from CINVESTAV in Mexico City and Helio Duarte from Belo Horizonte, Brazil) have been involved for many years in the development of a powerful suite of modeling tools known as deMon2k (see http://www.demon-software.com ). The special opportunity of this proposal arises from the confluence of the latest methodological developments for the computations, merging with a set of important questions that can now be addressed, thanks to the new methods, in the development and optimization of ultra-dispersed catalysts for in-situ upgrading. 

This union of modeling expertise with important experiments and field trials has the potential to transform the way new catalytic materials are envisaged, formulated, synthesized, tested, optimized and produced.

"The modeling of complex systems in chemistry, physics, biology, materials science and related interdisciplines has taken great strides in recent years. In the areas of interest to this proposal, advances in quantum chemistry, in molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics, in statistical and stochastic methodologies and in the treatment of kinetic networks are merging.  And an embryonic systems approach is emerging. Some of the most interesting frontier work is interdisciplinary and integrative in nature and requires theories and methodologies that span large ranges on spatial and temporal scales. The long-term goal of my research program is to contribute to the development of such multi-scale modeling methodologies, to their implementation in efficient computer codes, and their application to catalytically-driven processes in complex biological and energy-related environments.

    Success would lead to better understanding of biological systems, of how biochemical reactions are coupled to larger scale properties of cellular components and of how they work together. Some of the applications will be related to the search for new drugs in the area of cardiovascular health and of cancer.

    The methods can also be used to understand petroleum chemistry under realistic conditions, such as those in heavy oil deposits or in the oil sands. New ultradispersed catalysts will be designed by a combined computational-experimental approach so that some of the important chemistry can be done underground, with less impact on the environment.

"My current and planned research focuses on the following sub-areas in theoretical computer science:

i) design of efficient approximation algorithms for problems that naturally arise in applications such as network design and computational economy, (ii) study of computational complexity and hardness of approximation for such problem, and (iii) algorithmic aspects of graph theory and graph coloring problems on planar graphs.



Most of the real world optimization problems, such as the ones on graphs that arise from applications in the design of networks, are NP-hard. Therefore, under widely believed assumptions, we cannot solve these problems in a reasonable amount of time. Given this, it is typically acceptable to compute a near optimal solution efficiently. So research has focused on the study of approximation algorithms; these are algorithms that run fast and produce a solution that is within a guaranteed factor of the optimal one. Among these optimization problems, those related to graphs and network design are particularly important and have attracted more attention recently. Another class of such problems arise in computational economy (for example how to price bundles of items to maximize revenue and or customer satisfaction). It is also  important to study the hardness of approximation (computational complexity) of these problems. This helps to put the quality of the proposed algorithms in perspective, and have a better understanding of the level of difficulty of these  problems which in turn could be used to design better algorithms.



A significant amount of my research will involve the study of coloring and other problems on graphs and in particular on planar graphs. Some of these problems (which have theoretical importance) have also applications in frequency channel assignments in a cellular network. The question of minimizing the number of colors in a specific coloring problem translates to minimizing the frequency bandwidth required in such a network.

"The proposal addresses the mathematical simulations of industrial processes. Using computers to solve the governing equations for the complex transport phenomena that take place increases our understanding of the process and provides a tool to improve efficiency and lessen negative environmental impact. It is proposed to simulate processes that involve several phases. Air-lift devices will be investigated and modelled. Air-lift devices are robust ways to lift a heavier phase by injecting air into a tube. A pipe opened on both ends is lowered into the seawater (or any other well) until it nearly touches the material to be lifted. When air is injected into the pipe below the water level, a liquid-air mixture with decreased density is produced above the injection point.  When sufficient air is delivered and the velocity of the liquid is higher than the solid settling velocity, the solid particles will be lifted upwards. The mathematical model of the process will constitute a new design tool for air-lift devices that have broad applications. Another application considered is the modeling of agglomeration in fluidized beds when three phases are present. Agglomerate formation decreases the efficiency of the fluidized bed process and leads to fouling. The application that is targeted is raw bitumen, which is upgraded to synthetic crude in a thermal coking process. The forming, transport, and breaking of the agglomerates will be investigated and modelled mathematically. The model will allow for improving the efficiency of the industrial process. The other topic addressed is the simulation of fiber motion in air-streams with application to dry-forming. The motion of an elastic fiber under the influence of the forces acting on it will be simulated. The model will be a tool that will allow for better design of the equipment and a more uniform fiber distribution in the product.","Wood, wood products and paper","University of British Columbia",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","M�canique des fluides","M�canique des fluides"

"Vibro-elastography (VE) involves applying a vibration to tissue with a specially designed vibrator and imaging the internal motion of the tissue to determine how stiff and how viscous tissue is. There is a vast literature on the correlation of mechanical properties of tissue with pathology. Vibro-elastography can be thought of as a form of remote objective palpation. Our goal is to develop a vibro-elastography system and evaluate it in a small patient study to determine the relationship between elasticity, viscosity and cancerous breast masses. The immediate goal is to determine whether vibro-elastography can supplement the information provided by conventional ultrasound used to guide a needle toward a suspicious region for biopsy.



The proposed technology involves the design and development of a hand held actuator that holds an ultrasound transducer and the development of a GUI to control the motion, as well as the associated signal processing algorithms to determine tissue motion and mechanical parameters from the tissue motion. Existing algorithms developed in our group will be improved and made to run in real-time, so that the medical professional who uses the system can scan a patient and superimpose on the standard image an image of tissue elasticity and viscosity. The system will be evaluated and tuned via a small patient study.

"One of the main obstacles to placing spacecrafts in orbits is their high price for launch. Therefore, weight has always been a major design concern for space industry. Inflatable technology is a promising solution for placing large metrology systems in space to meet their launch volume and mass goals. This emerging technology offers lightweight, stowable and deployable satellite systems that can be compressed into folded stacks of a few inches thickness during launch and can be inflated and deployed over hundreds of feet in space. Because these structures are stowed during launch and deployed only upon reaching the destination orbit, the critical loads and disturbances in space are of particular importance. This is in contrast with older satellites for which most critical loads are met during launch. One of the most important sources of environmental disturbance is the rapid temperature change encountered on passing through the Earth's shadow. Such disturbances can induce bending moments and torques in the structure which result in thermal oscillations that can corrupt the pointing accuracy and precision of the satellite system and can last anytime from a few hours to a year. Therefore, a major objective of the proposed research is to develop novel analytical and experimental techniques for investigation and characterization of thermal loads on some of the major components of inflatable structures such as rigidized booms and Mylar membranes. This study will investigate the dynamic response of these materials to rapid temperature changes. The experimental techniques along with complementary modeling methods for inflatable structures represent novel aspects of this work and will make a significant contribution to our understanding of the thermal dynamic behaviour of the inflatable structures. The results will be used to develop control techniques to minimize the susceptibility of such systems to thermal disturbances. The proposed research program is intended to train the next generation HQP in structural vibration and control, with experimental applications which are in demand by industrial companies such as COM DEV International Ltd., MDA and the Canadian Space program.",Aerospace,"University of Waterloo",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Vibrations,"G�nie m�canique"

"Virtualization is fast becoming a critical technology in modern data centers. Server virtualization allows software to be deployed on virtual servers, which can then be hosted on a pool of physical machines. This makes it easy, for example, to move a software service from a smaller physical host to a more powerful one, or to move services off of a physical host that has failed or is in need of maintenance or repair. Virtualization also supports resource consolidation in data centers. Instead of physically overprovisioning each software application to accommodate that application's peak load, virtualized applications dynamically and flexibly share a common, consolidated pool of physical resources.



The goal of this project is to develop techniques for automating the administration of virtual database appliances, which are database management systems that are deployed on virtual servers. We propose to develop techniques for automatically adjusting the physical resources that are used to host a virtual database appliance, so that the database system will be able to attain specified performance targets. We propose to develop techniques for automatically scaling up  virtual database appliances over time as their workload grows. Finally, we propose to to develop techniques for minimizing the power required to host a given set of virtual database appliances on a pool of physical servers.

"Enterprises are changing the way that they deploy software applications.   Silo-based deployments are giving way to deployments based on shared, centralized pools of computing resources managed in so-called utility data centers.  In silo deployments, a stack of related applications, such as a web server together with an underlying application server and database management system, is deployed on dedicated computing resources,  with dedicated administrative and management functions.  In contrast, the utility data center consolidates computing resources and allows them to be shared among multiple application stacks and managed for the benefit of the enterprise as a whole. One advantage of the utility data center model is cost savings resulting from increased utilization of resources.  The technologies surrounding resource consolidation are becoming more mature, making flexible management of these data centers a reality.    



Database systems are a key component in  many application stacks. From the perspective of database management systems, the move from silos to utility data centers is significant because database systems can no longer count on known, dedicated computing resources, as they can in a silo. The goal of the work proposed here is to adapt database systems, and their related management utilities and practices, to the utility data center. This will enable flexible and effective deployment and management of database systems under the new model.

"Advances in medicine have increased the demand for highly accurate micro-robotic devices and surgical systems. These tools enhance the abilities of the operator and permit procedures that might not be possible otherwise. The success and functionality of these tools depend on the accuracy and physical size of the embedded sensors and actuators. New materials must be examined and incorporated into designs which can minimize their size while providing more flexibility. In this research, piezoceramics will be examined as a mechanism for both highly precise actuators and sensors. Piezoceramics have high power density and high accuracy which makes them ideal for miniaturization. 

      The overall objective of this program is the development and integration of novel devices to support biomedical applications. This will be accomplished by pursuing piezoceramic-based actuators and sensors. The first objective will be to develop a biomedical research platform. Typically cell manipulation is performed manually which requires great skill and is time intensive. Enhancing the technician's abilities or controlling the stage via input from a vision system could greatly improve efficiency and aid research in that field. Another major thrust will be to develop a needle positioning system based on piezoceramic actutors in an inchworm configuration. Robotic assisted surgery is becoming more common. Improved control of needle interventions will increase success rates and permit more demanding surgeries. Longer term goals are to develop the processes to achieve consistent performance of thin film piezoceramics and to develop micro sensors employing thin film piezoceramics. 

      The anticipated outcomes of the research program are new tools for surgeons and biomedical researchers that enable them to achieve a higher degree of accuracy and functionality than what exists today. It will also enable the training of 4-5 MESc and PhD students to develop skills in mechanical, electrical and control design in a multidisciplinary environment.

"Unitary representations are realizations of group actions as isometries of generally infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. In early twentieth century, the study of unitary representations was motivated by physicists' interest in symmetries of quantum mechanical systems. Nowadays, these representations appear in many diverse areas of mathematics. 



My main objective in my research is to apply methods from analysis in order to understand a special but important class of unitary representations which are called singular representations. Singular representations appear naturally in relation with the theory of automorphic forms and the Langlands program, but their importance in mathematics is not limited to this area. They also play a significant role in geometric integration theory, distribution of rational points on varieties, and structure of certain homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. Therefore, a classification of singular representations has enormous applications. However, studying singular representations is a difficult problem, since general constructions of unitary representations usually do not yield singular representations.



I propose to classify singular representations using an integer-valued invariant that I have defined in a systematic way (which I call ""rank""). A comparison with other fundamental ingredients of representation theory of reductive groups (e.g., the theory of discrete series or quantization of nilpotent orbits) indicates that it is both important and challenging to avoid case by case methods and to understand the general picture. My general definition of rank fulfills this desire. In my research I aim to construct and investigate various attributes and applications of representations with small rank.

"The new Power Electronic circuit topologies to be investigated in this research program are intended for three specific application areas: motor drive systems for pumps, compressors and air ventilation systems; utility rectifiers for industrial drive systems; alternative energy systems for windpower generators and high speed microturbine generators.

   The prime technical objective of the program is to improve the utilization of capacitor smoothed multiple voltage sources for pwm converters in low power applications. The main technical goals are to create new topologies with a lower switch count, increased functionality and higher power conversion efficiencies. Cheaper power electronic structures will result, electrical components will experience lower electrical stresses, and filter sizes reduced. The feasibility of multi-level pwm converters will be increased in low power applications with associated improvements in performance levels. Electrical drives for low power motors in domestic applications will become more economic. Improved, reliable and more economic utility interfaces will result for alternative energy systems.

   Themes associated with the research concepts include: multi-functional converters and pwm controllers; utilization of mutually coupled inductors to obtain stacked capacitor banks with automatic voltage sharing; concepts of ""circuit families"" and ""circuit duality"" will help generate a wide range of new topologies and increase design choices

   The new power electronic topologies resulting from the work, will contribution to the advancement of technology that will allow more sophisticated power conversion techniques to be applied in low power applications such as fractional horsepower drives and low power wind generators. 

   Presently 4 M.Sc. & 2 PhD students are under my supervision, so I expect an extra 6-8 M.Sc. & 2-4 PhD students will obtain research experience over the course of this research program.

"My research on finite-state machines is part of the theory of computing. Algorithms based on finite-state machines are used in practically all areas of computing, from natural language processing to software verification. My work deals with lower bounds for the size of finite-state machines. This area of research is called descriptional complexity. When we have an implementation of a finite-state machine for a problem P, this gives an upper bound for the descriptional complexity of P. However, the crucial task is to establish lower bounds, that is, we have to prove that no machine of smaller size can solve the problem. Work on descriptional complexity contributes to our understanding of fundamental questions on the difficulty of computational problems. Descriptional complexity has recently become more important also from an applications point of view since finite-state machines used in natural language processing may require millions of states.



A finite-state machine can be in one of a finite number of states and changes its state at discrete time steps according to a given set of transitions. A typical example of the type of questions I am interested in, is to determine the number of transitions that a machine with a given number of states may need in the worst-case. The number of transitions is at most quadratic in the number of states, even if the machine is nondeterministic, that is, it can have multiple transitions for a given state and input symbol. However, currently we do not have matching lower bounds. In order to find worst-case examples we need both theoretical tools from combinatorics and software implementations of the finite-state machines to test our conjectures. 



The work of the proposal involves, at a given time, the training of 2 Ph.D. and 2 M.Sc. students. Our research group hosted the 9th International Conference on Implementation and Application of Automata at Queen's University in July 2004.

"In 1984, Bennett and Brassard proposed a scheme allowing two parties to agree on a secret key provided they have access to a channel capable of transmitting quantum bits. This scheme, called quantum key distribution, is remarkable since it achieves something impossible through classical means alone. Until the mid 90's  quantum information appeared to be cryptographers' best friend. Expectations were that all  modern cryptographic applications could be resolved  unconditionally using quantum communication whereas classical cryptography could only hope for security relying upon unproven computational assumptions out of which the majority do not hold against quantum adversaries. One essential class of cryptographic applications are the ones involving two parties willing to collaborate but otherwise not trusting each other. Many daily electronic transactions are of that kind, making two-party cryptography a critical tool for the information age. An example is our frequent interactions with ATMs asking us to identify ourselves before being granted access to our bank account. In 1995, Mayers and Lo & Chau shattered this dream when they prove that the most important cryptographic primitives for two-party cryptography cannot be implemented securely using quantum communication. On the other hand, quantum protocols have been found for weak two-party primitives otherwise impossible using classical communication alone. Unlike for key distribution, the capabilities of quantum cryptography in the two-party setting  are not well understood. The project's main goal is to provide a deeper understanding for the true power of quantum cryptography in two-party applications. Improving our insight on what it can achieve in this setting could have important consequences for the design of systems providing security in electronic transactions. New systems inspired by this research could offer privacy more efficiently and under weaker assumptions. Even entirely classical protocols could benefit from this work by extending the realm of their security to adversaries in possession of quantum computers. Any satisfactory advance toward our main objective would improve our comprehension of the differences between classical and quantum information.

"As networks continue to grow in size, technology-sophistication and geographical-reach, their management is becoming a major bottleneck in accommodating newer non-traditional, real-time, and mission-critical applications, even to the most experienced administrators. To address this problem, the long-term objective of the applicant's proposal is to bring the concepts of self-management to existing and emerging species of networks to create multi-technology networks with extremely large coverage, high-speeds, reliable quality-of-service (QoS), while keeping human supervision at minimal levels. Such a long-term prospect is achievable through identifying immediate problems that have both theoretical and practical significance. Following this methodology, the applicant's short-term activities will focus on the recently introduced technology of Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs).These activities will be formulated as three main research problems. The first problem addresses the development of schemes to automate the construction of quasi-static topologies with maximum capacity. Two main approaches will be investigated to address this problem namely, graph coloring and multi-player quantum gaming theories. The second problem relates to how to dynamically allocate calculated WMN capacity efficiently and dynamically among a collection of classes of services, each endowed with a set of QoS requirements.  To achieve self-managment of resource allocation, the solution will take inspiration from mechanisms in ecosystems. Finally, the third problem targets the assurance of fairness through the control of the cooperative behavior among nodes. While in other infrastructure-based networks, a centralized management entity controls the behavior of nodes to ensure fairness among users, this approach is not feasible in WMNs. Hence, a self-policing mechanism must be developed to ensure the cooperative behavior in making management decisions (e.g., resource allocation). 

The developed solutions will differ from traditional approaches in that they can self-evolve to enhance their performances or to face changes in the problem domain.

"The dopamine (DA) system is critical for normal, everyday behaviours including eating, procreation and movement, but abnormal DA function is linked to a number of psychiatric disorders including psychosis and drug addiction. The most widely-used animal model of DA hyperactivity involves repeated stimulation of the DA system via administration of DA agonists (e.g., amphetamine) and this model has helped researchers to better understand DA function under normal and abnormal conditions. However, chronic suppression of the DA system (for example, via blockade of DA D2/3 receptors) also induces a DA hyperactive state. This alternate model of DA supersensitivity is an ideal tool to further our understanding of the DA system and its function. However, little is known about the long-term behavioural consequences of chronic DA receptor blockade or about the neurobiological processes involved in the induction of DA supersensitivity under these conditions. The primary goal of the proposed research, therefore, is to use animal models to determine the effects of chronic DA D2/3 receptor blockade on DA-dependent behaviours and to explore potential underlying mechanisms. This will be achieved by treating rats with the DA D2/3 receptor antagonist haloperidol and measuring their behavioural response in commonly-used tests of DA function, including psychomotor sensitization, intravenous drug self-administration and operant responding for conditioned reward. Prior research suggests that increased activity within a specific population of neurons that express the neuropeptide enkephalin and form the striatopallidal pathway might be a common mechanism underlying the ability of either DA agonists or DA D2/3 receptor antagonists to induce a DA supersensitive state. Therefore, I will determine whether the effects of haloperidol treatment on the DA-dependent behaviour mentioned above involve increased activity within the enkephalin/striatopallidal pathway. As such, these results will increase our basic understanding of the functions subserved by the DA system and allow us to better predict outcome when DA function is abnormal.","Advancement of knowledge","Universit� de Montr�al",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Neurologie du comportement --r�compense, motivation",Psychologie
"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is a major health problem worldwide. Surgical resection is is the most invasive form of lung cancer treatment with significant post-operative mortality and morbidity rates. One type of effective and minimally invasive treatment option for lung cancer patients is brachytherapy. In brachytherapy, low dose radioisotopes (seeds) are placed permanently in the tumour. To be effective, the seeds must be implanted within the tumour tissue uniformly. A significant hurdles of lung brachytherapy is the tumour mobility which renders placing the seeds at the proper locations extremely difficult.

OBJECTIVES: The main focus of this research is to develop software component of a brachytherapy system responsible for guiding the brachytherpay needle. This oftware determines needle orientation, forces and trajectory of needle tip within the tissue for accurate targeting. This component will be designed such that it can be integrated with a robotic brachytherapy system.

SCIENTIFIC APPROACH: The tumour tissue displacement and deformation are caused by lung tissue deformation resulting from needle insertion and respiration.  A novel technique (SFEM) we developed will be employed to predict tissue deformation associated with needle insertion. To determine tumour displacement caused by respiration, a Neural Network (NN) will be employed. 

NOVEL ASPECTS: Lung brachytherapy is a novel concept and brachytherapy system development is still in its infancy. The technique tackles needle insertion in moving and deformable tissue. Novel contributions include using lung biomechanical model to simulate needle insertion; and using efficient SFEM model for tissue deformation simulation to make real-time navigation possible.

SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed brachytherapy guidance software will result in an accurate system leading to a very effective minimally invasive technique of lung cancer treatment. The system is expected to significantly reduce mortality and morbidity rates currently observed post-operatively.

"A smart space is a physical environment that is saturated with sensory, computing and communication capabilities together with the software that integrates them. It will anticipate the needs of its occupants and will provide services as and when they are needed. Such spaces have applications in diverse areas such as healthcare, manufacturing, education, environment monitoring, command centers and security. A key building block that is needed to make such a system a reality is the capability to identify, locate and track objects (both animate and inanimate) in this space. Such a capability also paves way for determining patterns of activity among the occupants of a smart space. In this proposal, we discuss the development of a software framework together with a set of tools for sensory data collection and analysis that will implement this building block for use in a sensor network.

Each tool in this system will encapsulate an algorithm that provides a particular functionality such as face detection, speech recognition and object location etc. More importantly, each tool will also incorporate the knowledge required to use the algorithm within itself. Such knowledge includes information about input data, algorithm parameters, output formats as well as information about the task it can accomplish and how well it can accomplish this task.

Our primary contribution in this proposal is the development of the software infrastructure that allows a society of expert tools to accomplish a given task, development of  templates for individual tools, development of knowledge representation mechanisms and vocabularies for individual tools as well as example based learning methods that allow certain tools to expand their capabilities.

A critical area that we plan to investigate is the aspects of security and privacy in a smart space, which are now gaining considerable attention. We propose to develop a set of security and privacy requirements for a smart space as well as develop the algorithms and mechanisms to support these requirements.

"The main objective of the proposed research is to develop intuitive methods for the interactive design of 3D models, suitable for graphical applications. 

Geometric modelling has a solid mathematical base. Models are built from several well-studied classes of parametric and/or implicit functions; for example, the use of NURBS in current modelling techniques leads to very efficient algorithms for manipulation and rendering. However, even with sophisticated software packages such as MAYA or 3DS MAX, modelling is still a challenging and time-consuming task that requires significant expertise. The main reason for this is not the lack of flexibility of the modelling software but the way in which users interact with it.  The user interface for geometric modelling using such representations as NURBS and subdivision surfaces is typically based on the idea of manipulating discrete values such as control points or weights associated with control points. The problem is that these manipulations do not correspond to the processes a designer or artist might intuitively use on any natural medium. Humans usually manipulate objects directly by pushing, pulling, bending, squeezing and twisting in 3D. In addition, traditionally other metaphors such as drawing, sketching, painting, and gesturing are added to the repertoire when 2D media are used. In particular, artists (i.e. traditional illustrators) are able to depict 3D forms and shapes with just a few 2D strokes. Furthermore, they use a multi-scale design process that progressively enhances the details of the shapes. Over thousands of years, artists have learned optimum ways of communicating with the human visual system. Although there is rich related work in graphical modelling to utilise such metaphors, there are still many unexplored techniques that provide a fascinating area of further research, with significant prospective applications. To achieve this main objective, I propose several research projects such as sketch-based surface modeller, intuitive interfaces for deformation of volumetric data sets, and sketch-based interfaces for complex models with branching structures.

"My main field of research is harmonic analysis with an emphasis on non- commutative groups such as amenable groups and Lie groups. Originally the introduction of harmonic analysis was motivated by studying waves and signals which goes back as far as Euler and later on Fourier. I am currently addressing problems from a recent point of view in this field developed mainly in 20th century; it is called non-commutative harmonic analysis. The motivation for such development came from the work of Andre Weil of creating an area that systematically studies various questions in harmonic analysis from different approaches, connecting this field to algebra and functional analysis. These connections, along with the recent applications of operator space theory to harmonic analysis, have made this area quite intersecting and fruitful.



The research projects I am pursuing primarily relate to the cohomological properties of various Banach algebras related to locally compact groups, including group algebras and Fourier algebras. This is an area of mathematics to which over the past thirty years a rich body of work has been dedicated. The seminal paper in this respect is certainly Barry E. Johnson's memoir in 1972 in which he introduces and explores the concept of amenability for a Banach algebra. Ruan's fundamental work in 1995 of introducing the concept of operator amenability, through the theory of operator spaces, has also had a significant influence on this area since.



My goal is to pursue further studies of appropriate cohomological properties, including amenability and weak amenability for various algebras in harmonic analysis and to study their connections with various concepts of spectral synthesis. I have contributed so far to this area of research and by pursuing my projects further, I will achieve more in this regard. Because of my various connections across Canada, my projects will help to strengthen the already well-established research activities in harmonic analysis in Canada.

This Organic and Bioorganic Workshop for Young Chemists will focus on establishing new collaborations through NSERC programs, such as NSERC Strategic Project Grants and Collaborative Research and Development Grants for new biomedical technologies.  The benefits of these collaborations are twofold:  they help young professors in Canada with funding for high-impact chemistry with direct biomedical application as well as assisting the already struggling pharmaceutical industry in Canada.  Such collaborations also assist in the training of graduate students by focusing their efforts on the direct application of chemistry to biomedically-relevant problems.  This industrial connection increases their knowledge of the pharmaceutical sector and enables them to quickly make the transition from research academics to working in industry.

"Nature provides a wealth of complex chemical compounds that have the potential to serve as new medicines and treatments.  While many of these natural products can be isolated in large quantities, many potentially bioactive compounds are only available in minute amounts.  Chemical total synthesis provides a means of accessing these compounds for both pharmaceutical evaluation and for the synthesis of medicinally relevant analogs.  Even with modern synthetic technology, many architecturally complex natural products can still not be synthesized in sufficient quantities for testing as medicines.



A ""family"" of natural products consists of compounds containing comparable core structures with only slight structural variations.  This new research program will focus on developing new synthetic technology for the synthesis of the central framework (or core) within a bioactive molecule.  The newly developed methodology is then not only immediately applicable toward the synthesis of the original compound, but can also be used to synthesize the entire family of related natural products.  The synthetic technology developed in this research program has the potential to unlock access to previously unavailable architecturally unique compounds in sufficient quantities for medicinal testing.  Success in this target-directed methodological development has great potential to boost Canada's pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.

"The major driving force of modern technology is research into new materials. Superconductors are one of the most important classes of materials, with a wide range of practical applications. In recent years the main focus of the research community has been on unconventional superconductors, such as high-temperature cuprates and ""heavy-fermion"" compounds, whose properties defy theoretical explanation.

The main objective of this research proposal is to better understand such interesting novel materials as superconductors without inversion symmetry and ferromagnetic superconductors, and explain the experimental puzzles presented by them. In particular, we want to understand what microscopic mechanisms make these materials superconducting and how fluctuations affect nonuniform superconducting phases. We hope that the results of this research will also provide insight into the physics of other complex superconducting and superfluid systems. 

The broader impact resulting from the proposed activity will be training of a new generation of highly-qualified personnel through an exposure to a wide range of ideas and methods of contemporary condensed matter physics.

"Wireless networks have seen phenomenal growth in the last few years and are being increasingly targeted in a wide range of application areas such as health care, the environment, distance education, pervasive computing, enterprise communications, personal communications and emergency services. Future mobile applications will run on a heterogeneous wireless network platform that will integrate different access technologies such as WiFi, WiMAX, 3G+ Cellular, as well as variable topology ad hoc, sensor and mesh networks. The objective is to give wireless users a secure, seamless access and ubiquitous ABC (""Always Best Connected"") coverage. However, the success of such a network will largely depend on the effective unification of techniques for security and resource management, which stand out as two critical design issues.The challenge stems from the fact that disparate access networks pose their own resource constraints and have varying vulnerabilities.



The primary objective of this research is to develop an integrated security and resource management framework for heterogeneous wireless networks. Toward the realization of this objective, it will investigate effective mechanisms to support end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) for wireless users accessing multimedia services over heterogeneous networks. Vulnerability analysis of each component network will be carried out to determine the intrusions that can be launched. The analyses will be used to design intrusion prevention techniques, with emphasis on lightweight mechanisms. Next, resource requirements of each component network and techniques for maintaining QoS for a given level of security will be evaluated. Finally, an end-to-end architecture that integrates the optimal set of security and resources for a given heterogeneous network configuration will be proposed. The research will provide training for several HQP, including three Ph.D. and twenty masters students. The outcome of the research will be a significant step in the design of ubiquitous and heterogeneous wireless networks, that are not only secure but also provide guaranteed QoS.

"The research program I propose to undertake under an NSERC Discovery Grant focuses on novel applications of several sensors in earth sciences and engineering. The first thrust concerns applications of three-dimensional laser imaging sensors which are emerging as promising tools in earth sciences. The second thrust relates to the monitoring of the electromagnetic environment of pipelines and water mains. In this case, the innovation resides in the combined use of several sensors.



A single laser image is typically composed of millions of points reflected on the surface of an object illuminated by a laser beam. Individual images are assembled into three-dimensional models by specialized software. As part of this research, rocks samples and drill cores will be imaged to a very high accuracy which bridges the gap between microscopy and visual inspection. Software tools will relate this information to geological processes like the cooling of lava flows and the development of porosity in rocks. At a larger distance in the field, panoramic images of rock faces will be acquired. Software will be developed to automatically detect fractures. This research will contribute an increased understanding of stability conditions in tunnels and underground mines. In addition, images taken at different times will be analyzed to detect changing conditions in an effort to mitigate against landslides.



Magnetic storms induce currents along pipelines and water mains which can locally accelerate corrosion. My current research has indicated a potential link between the severity of this effect along a natural gas pipeline in the Ottawa River Valley and the electrical properties of geological features in the vicinity. The proposed research will test this hypothesis further in another geological setting and export the methodology developed for pipelines to water mains.

"The flow of the solar wind around the Earth's magnetosphere leads to the storage of energy in the hot ionized gas or plasma and the magnetic fields surrounding the Earth.  This plasma regime starts about 100 km above the Earth in the ionosphere and extends many tens of Earth radii into space.  The region dominated by Earth's magnetic field is called the magnetosphere.  Auroral displays are one of the examples of the release of this stored energy into the upper regions of the Earth's atmosphere and ionosphere.  The research program focuses on two auroral phenomena, the auroral arc and the auroral or magnetic substorm.  Projects in the program include experimental, theoretical, and computational studies of the energy transport in these space plasmas, with major thrusts in three directions, including the sources of ultralow frequency (ULF, 1-10 mHz, 100-1000 s period) shear Alfven, field line resonances (FLRs), the physics of FLRs and auroral arcs, and the physics of substorms in the magnetosphere and ionosphere.

"Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology is a tool to look at the overall environmental impacts of a product/process/service from the extraction of raw materials to the treatment of wastes and disposal of products themselves at the end. Given its holistic approach, the strength of the LCA methodology lies in the ability to identify any displacement of environmental impacts from both, an impact category to another one (e.g. from acidification to global warming) or a phase of the product to another one (e.g. from the production to the use phase). Such a methodology should consider all the processes and their sub-processes along the whole product's life cycle. This implies a lot of data to collect and manage. As it is costly, time consuming and sometimes simply not possible to collect all the specific data required, it is necessary to use life cycle inventory databases. A direct consequence is the use of less appropriate data, which means a possible loss in quality of the LCA study.

If many works have already been performed on managing the data uncertainty in LCA, only few work have been initiated for solving the problem of data gap and inconsistent data. This research program focuses on these two sources of uncertainty. For the data gap, the objective is to develop a mathematical model based on the relationship that similar processes may have together in order to use the ""known"" characteristics to estimate the ""unknown"" characterisitics of other processes showing to the same function. Then in order to improve the data consistency, the objective is to develop a methodology, inspired by what is done in Material Flow Analysis (MFA), to balance the mass and energy flows entering and leaving a process. Finally, these two developments will be linked to the ongoing works related to other sources of data uncertainty in LCA.  The expected outcome of this research will be a complete framework to guide LCA practitioners and sceintists for the development of high quality life cycle inventories, and thereby, high quality LCA studies.

"Recent development efforts in aluminum have focused on wrought alloys where, through the use of the well-established technology of Al extrusions, such alloys as the heat-treatable 6xxx series alloys are being increasingly used in sheet and other applications where relatively high formability and in-service strength are major requirements. Mg and Si are the main alloying elements and combine to form Mg2Si, the primary hardening phase; Cu is commonly added, to further increase the strength. Metals such as Fe, Mn and Cr are present as impurities or trace additions. Thus, in addition to alpha-Al, Si and Mg2Si, a wide range of Fe and Cu-bearing intermetallics namely, Al-Fe, Al-Fe-Si, Al-Fe-Mn-Si and Al-Mg-Si-Cu (Q phase) form during solidification, homogenization and thermomechanical processing of the alloy. The alloy composition and casting conditions influence the type, morphology and amount of intermetallics formed, as do the thermal treatments applied. The brittle beta-Al5FeSi platelets adversely influence the extrusion properties and induce surface defects in the extruded material. The as-cast alloy is thus homogenized at temperatures of 530-600oC, during which the beta-AlFeSi phase transforms to the more favorable alpha-Al(FeMn)Si phase, which improves the alloy extrudability and surface quality considerably. This project proposes to study the formation of the key intermetallic phases, namely Mg2Si, beta-Fe, alpha-Fe, and the Cu-containing Q phase, occurring in 6xxx alloys by selecting alloy compositions and conditions favorizing the formation of each intermetallic type by itself. The study will focus on the role of Mn (0.02-0.9%) in stabilizing the beta-to-alpha transformation, and that of additions such as Zr and Sc to partially replace expensive Mn, and thus provide cost-effective solutions for attaining high alloy formability and increased tensile properties. Hardness measurements, tensile properties and extensive TEM and EPMA analyses will be used to monitor the microstructural evolution in the as-cast, homogenized, and cold rolled stages, in relation to alloy formability. The results would benefit the Canadian automotive and construction industries, two main application areas of interest.","Materials performance","Universit� du Qu�bec � Chicoutimi",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Transformation des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"
"Primary Al-7%Si-Mg foundry alloys such as A356 and 357 have been used extensively in structural applications where higher and more consistent mechanical properties are a key requirement to uphold the safety standards of the cast components. Addition of Mg increases strength via precipitation hardening to provide specific combinations of strength and ductility. Iron, usually present as an impurity, has a negative influence on the alloy properties due to the formation of iron intermetallics, notably the brittle beta-iron A15FeSi phase in the form of platelets which cause feeding-related problems, resulting in porosity formation and early fracture. The formation of the pi-iron A19FeMg3Si5 phase is also undesirable, as it ties up Mg and lowers the alloy strength/ductility. The target, therefore, is to keep the Fe level as low as possible. It has been reported recently that Al-9%Si alloys are more tolerant to iron than 356 and 319 alloys. The ductility of Al-9%Si-Cu-Mg alloys showed vast improvements compared to those containing low Si levels, even in the presence of high Cu, Mg, and Fe contents. While the reason for this is yet to be understood, this is a significant observation, with immense potential for alloy development. Another area of interest is that related to the production of Be-free 357 (Al-7%Si-Mg) alloys. These alloys, containing high Mg levels, are used in castings which require high yield strengths. However, the high Mg also leads to the formation of the pi-phase. While Be is used to eliminate this phase, its toxic nature has made it necessary to seek other alternatives. The proposed research program will address these two main concerns through (i) a fundamental characterization of Al-9%Si alloys (359 and 354 type alloys) using the quality index concept to optimize the tensile properties, and (ii) a comprehensive study of pi-A19FeMg3Si5 phase formation in Al-Si-Mg alloys through a fundamental characterization of the alloy microstructure and related mechanical properties of Be-free 357 alloys, with emphasis on the effect of iron impurities. The application of these findings by the aluminum industry and castings producers would be of distinct benefit to the Canadian economy.","Materials performance","Universit� du Qu�bec � Chicoutimi",3,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","M�tallurgie","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"
"Flowering plants cannot control the type of pollen grains that land on its stigma and have appropriate recognition mechanisms to either accept or reject the pollen. Successful plant reproduction is dependent on a compatible interaction between the pollen/pollen tube and the pistil. In plant species of Brassicaceae which are characterized by dry stigmas, only a compatible pollen can induce the pistil to provide all the necessary resources for its hydration and penetration into the stigmatic tissue. In contrast, during Brassica (canola, broccoli and cabbage) self-incompatibility (SI) (a selection mechanism to prevent inbreeding), recognition of the self-pollen, induces a highly ordered signaling mechanism that rejects the self-pollen (blocks allocation of pistil resources for pollen hydration/germination). Despite the exciting progress made in understanding plant fertilization, knowledge is still limited about the early signaling mechanisms during pollen/pistil interactions. My long term goal is to gain a thorough understanding of the signaling mechanisms that regulate compatible pollination during plant reproduction and to map the interplay between the compatibility and incompatibility pathways. Through studying self-incompatibility in Brassica, we identified that SI targets the exocytosis-mediated secretory events that are required for compatible pollen acceptance. In a proteomics screen to identify factors regulated by SI, we identified that both phospholipase D-alpha 1 (PLD1) and annexin1 (ANX1) (known regulators of exocytosis) are targeted by SI. The primary focus of this research program is to study the functional role of both PLD1 and ANX1 during compatible pollination events in Brassica and to elucidate the mechanism by which SI targets these proteins. The second aspect is to understand how conserved their functions are in regulating compatible pollination in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (a self-fertile species of Brassicaceae), where these proteins are represented by gene families.  This research will significantly advance our understanding of early signaling during pollen-pistil interactions, a key event for successful reproduction. Understanding plant reproduction allows us to develop strategies to improve crop yield.

"All plant growth, including agricultural and forestry production, requires cell wall synthesis.  Plant cells are wall-synthesizing factories, and plant growth and development depends on delivery of cell wall components at the appropriate location and rate.  Despite its critical importance, there is a major gap in our understanding of cell wall biosynthesis: how are cell wall components that are made inside the cell exported to the outside of the cell to build a functional wall?  While every cell in a plant is surrounded by a polysaccharide cell wall, there are also regions of the cell wall with specialized function.  For example, the primary plant surface is coated with a lipidic cell wall layer called the cuticle that protects the plant from water loss, insects and pathogens.  Another important type of specialized cell walls are lignified walls in vascular tissue, such as wood, where lignin makes the wall strong and waterproof.



The long-term goal of my research is to understand how plant cells secrete their cell walls, both polysaccharides and specialized cell wall components such as lipids and lignin.  In this proposal, two projects are addressed: first, how are lipids of the cuticle exported by ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters and, second, how are lignin precursors exported during wood formation?   My lab discovered the ABC transporters that are required for export of wax molecules to the plant cuticle, now we want to fit into them into bigger picture of wax export.  Using a combination of molecular biology and advanced microscopy techniques, the delivery of wax components to the transporters, transporter interactions and lipid export across the cell wall by lipid transfer proteins will be tested.  In developing wood, both the polysaccharides secreted by the Golgi and the lignin precursors secreted by unknown mechanisms will be examined.  The lignin component of cell walls has been identified as a barrier to digestion of cellulose feedstocks for ethanol biofuels so understanding lignin precursor export has important potential applications.","Advancement of knowledge","University of British Columbia",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres"

"When a molecule in a solid adsorbs energy from ultra-violet light (UV), x-rays or another type of  high energy radiation, it will likely be ionised and eject an electron. Occasionally this electron will have considerable energy and will travel far through the solid, ionizing (damaging) many other molecules. Mostly however, the electron will be of low energy, unable to travel very far or induce further damage through ionization. Indeed, in physicists' models of radiation damage, such low energy electrons (LEE) and their effects are usually ignored.

Professor Sanche's proposal concerns LEE and the chemistry they can induce in a diverse range of materials. By firing beams of LEE on thin solid samples, Professor Sanche and co-workers in his laboratory, have shown that LEE can be temporarily captured by a condensed molecule to form a transient negative ion (TNI) and this greatly enhances energy transfer to the molecule. Formation of a TNI can also cause the fragmentation of the molecule, even when the incident electron's energy is too small for ionization or even (on occasion) excitation. Molecular fragments created in this way may then react with neighbouring molecules producing even further damage. Already this work has shown that molecules are large as DNA can be broken by LEE, a result with significant implications for how radiation is used to treat cancer. But LEE are also liberated by the passage radiation through the condensed gases that accumulate on grains in interstellar dust clouds and may thus play a role in the synthesis of the simple organic molecules, building blocks for life that have already been detected on meteorites. LEE are furthermore encountered in the fabrication and operation of nanoscale electronic components. 

The proposed research will quantify LEE induced processes occurring in a range of materials relevant for nanolithography and the operation of nanoscale devices and will improve our understanding of possible chemical synthesis occurring in interstellar dust clouds.

"The oldest and most important unsolved question in quantum theory (QT) is, ""What is the meaning of the wave function?"" This has been debated since the early days, with Einstein heading one side and Bohr the other. The answer is of vital importance to the continued development of both fundamental ideas and technologies that depend upon QT. Emerging technologies that are affected include quantum teleportation, cryptography and information theory. In addition to focusing on the above question, many more are relevant to my research, the long range goal of which is to secure the statistical interpretation of QT and study its underlying structure: Is nature local or not? Is entanglement a property of nature or of QT? Is nature statistical or deterministic? Is teleportation possible? How is information carried in qubits? What does the Heisenberg Principle mean? Einstein believed a deeper theory existed than QT because God does not play dice; Bohr believed that nature is fundamentally statistical. The side of Einstein is supported by my discovery within the last year that a spin � has two, not one, axes of quantization: the 2D spin. This model leads to some surprising results including proving that the entangled Bell states are separable. Therefore entanglement is a property of QT, but not at the level of single particles. The 2D spin also gives a local interpretation to the class of experiments that are usually thought to demonstrate non-locality. Moreover the 2D spin produces another spin state through interference, and this spin fringe has irrational quantum numbers of �1/root(2) rather than �1/2. The self-interference of a single 2D spin suggests a mechanism that would resolve the double-slit experiment. All three spin components are simultaneously well defined, even though they do not commute. However because of degeneracy, a rationalization of the statistical nature of QT emerges. The usual spin with a single axis of quantization is recovered when a magnetic field is applied to the 2D spin. All these intuitive ideas come at the expense of the hermitian postulate of quantum mechanics because the 2D spin states are found to be non-hermitian.

"Light does more than illuminate our lives. Light is also a fast medium for communication with low losses and high data rates. The bottleneck for light-based communication is processing the information in light. 



Processing typically involves electronics. All-optical processing would dramatically speed up light-based communication and also open doors to new technologies such as quantum computing.



The speed of light is also one of its problems. It is too fast. Also light only weakly interacts with light so using light to control light is difficult, and light has a tendency to spread out, which also weakens its controllability. But good news is on the way. It should soon be possible to control light with light, compress light beyond its diffraction limit, and greatly slow it down by enhancing the nonlinearity of its host material.



This project is developing practical proposals for greatly enhancing this optical nonlinearity so light can control light. One way to improve the nonlinearity is to change the boundaries of the host medium. Another way is to use extra control fields to take advantage of beneficial interfering pathways for electron excitations. An even better approach is to combine these methods, which is the focus of this research program.



This project will bring the future of light controlling light much closer to the present. Collaborations with leading experimentalists will ensure that the theories are fully tested for various host materials including diamond nanocrystals, atomic gases, and semiconductor quantum dots. When all-optically controlled light is working, dramatic speed-ups in communication and computing will follow.","Physical sciences","University of Calgary",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Optique (voir aussi dispositifs photoniques, 2505)",Physique
"Proteins are critical compounds in all living systems. Enzymes are a type of protein that catalyze the chemical reactions that allow an organism to function. Virtually all life processes are controlled by proteins and to properly understand how proteins work, we use a technique called protein X-ray crystallography to examine their structures at very high magnification.



The broad objective of my research is to increase our understanding of how proteins recognize the compounds that they bind. This objective is approached by using different techniques to analyze how well proteins recognize other molecules. We can then compare this information with the structures of these complexes. Our work is aimed at determining the role that structure has in the recognition process. This program emphasizes discovery, studying both model systems for protein-protein interactions, and enzymes of poorly understood functions. Outcomes of this work will include structure-assisted drug design, and a model system for understanding other protein-protein interaction systems.



Our lab studies several different protein systems, including 'UGM'and the thioredoxin system. UGM is an enzyme that is required by bacteria to form their protective cell wall. The reaction is unique to this enzyme and our continued work will have an impact on developing novel antimicrobial drugs. The thioredoxin system has an important role in all organisms for combating oxidative damage. The system is being used as a model for studying protein-protein interactions. Our work on this sytem will have an impact on future studies of protein-protein interactions.

"The program will be built around the Coulomb explosion technique (Coulomb imaging) this method uses the intense field of a laser to remove many electrons from a molecule in rapid succession, the atomic ions which the molecule is reduced to then repel each other with Coulombs force and fly apart. We will use time and position sensitive detection to detect all of these fragment ions and reconstructing the geometry of the molecule.  

    )	In order to make the best representation of a molecule it is necessary to remove as many electrons from the molecule in the shortest time, therefore as part of the program we will continue to develop and seek out the shortest pulses possible, with the highest intensity available.  

    )	One very important application of Coulomb imaging is to study the changing geometry of a molecule during an excitation or dissociation. We will aim to image the changing shape of molecules during a non dissociating excitation for the first time.

    )	Closely related to the pursuit of the Coulomb imaging process is a study of the ionization and dissociation mechanisms in small molecules.  Here we will use the capabilities of our apparatus to make complete measurements of molecular disintegration, to try to distinguish different pathways in the ionization process, we will map the way ionization changes as the molecule breaks apart.

Finally we will aim to control the vibrational state of a molecule using two laser pulses which have energies varying in time such that the difference in their energies is always equal to the energy needed to increase the vibrational level. This is known as Raman chirped adiabatic passage or RCAP.  This method might be able to transfer a high proportion of a molecules vibration population to a specific level.  We expect that we might be able to image these vibrating molecules with a Coulomb explosion method.  This last part of the project will take place at the Advanced Laser Light Source near Montreal.

"The objective of work in my laboratory is to use the methods of genetics and genomics to reveal the basis for the astonishing degree of genetic variability which is found in bacterial populations.  The over 2000 serovars of Salmonella vary dramatically, including S. enterica serovar Typhimurium which causes gastroenterites in many animals and humans, and S. enterica  serovar Typhi which causes a much more serious enteric fever (Typhoid) only in humans, and thousands of other forms.  I began studies in the 1960s by constructing a linkage map of the chromosome of S. Typhimurium with less than 200 genes mapped;  in 2001  a collaborative effort with other labs sequenced about 4800 genes in the genome of the same bacterium.  Sequence reveals that there are blocks of DNA, called Islands, in different serovars,  which are present in some, but missing from others, and these produce different properties and virulence.  Typhi has an Island which controls a virulence antigen; we have studied the loss of that island.  In the coming grant period we have  two major goals.  (1) Comparative genomic analysis in enteric bacteria.  We will be completing seven genomes which are being  sequenced in our collaboration with Washington Univ. Genome Sequencing Center. We take part in gene annotation in these seven genomes, and overall comparisons of the genomes of all sequences to reveal phylogenetics, and to explain the basis for different phenotypes.   (2)  Study of the presence and role of prophages in bacterial genomes.  Prophages are present in most genomes, e.g., S. Typhimurium strain LT2  has four.  Whole genome sequencing reveals putative prophages based on bioinformatic studies, but we propose  biological studies which will reveal if these are active prophages which can form free phage particles and transmit genes to other hosts.

"In the recent past, human movement measurement systems have significantly evolved from conventional manual tools, to sophisticated real-time imaging systems, and recently, systems embedded with wireless capabilities. Although the technology has made great strides in providing better analytical tools for research purposes these tools still remain isolated from the clinics due to exorbitant costs, operational complexity requiring specific expertise and, the time to process the data in order to derive meaningful information. While there is a need to disseminate research findings to the clinics there is an equally pressing need to translate the findings into simple practical solutions that are affordable and that can be implemented in the clinics. Furthermore, a majority of the technology advances cater to grasping (prehensile) kinematics. The global objective of this research program is to develop simple portable instrumented solutions to measure grasping kinetics that can eventually be used in the clinics for the prognosis and diagnosis of hand-related impairments. 

The specific aims of the research program are: (1) Design sensor configurations to measure prehensile kinetics and configurations to house the sensing elements; (2) Develop mathematical algorithms to characterize the measured output into relevant grip parameters; (3) Transform the designs and methods into clinically relevant, affordable, user-friendly hand assessment tools. The potential of the research program is two-fold: (a) it will be beneficial to the clinical community because of its bench-to-bedside approach to minimize the existing gap between clinical evaluation and research measurement methods; (b) from a prognosis and diagnosis standpoint it will cater to a wide range of hand-related deficits (e.g. stroke, neuropathy, tendon and joint problems). From an engineering perspective, the proposed research program adds a creative engineering element and provides another avenue for clinically relevant measurement tools in upper limb biomechanics.

"We study the mathematics, statistics and computing of genome rearrangements, the evolutionary processes by which segments of chromosomes are inverted, moved around and exchanged.  There is an algorithmic technology for inferring a minimizing sequence of operations necessary to transform one genome into another, where the operations are modeled on processes such as inversion, reciprocal translocation, chromosome fusion and fission, transposition of chromosomal segments. Once these inferences are made, however, there is a need for some way to statistically validate both the inferences and the assumptions of the evolutionary model. 

    Our approach is to use models of random genomes to see to what extent there is an signal remaining in the comparative structure of the two genomes, or whether evolution has largely scrambled the order of each one with respect to the other. 

    We work on the problem of the rearrangement median for three genomes as the basis for gene order phylogeny based on rearrangements, and apply it to chloroplast and mammalian data sets.  

    We study the ""genome halving problem"" for ancient tetraploids and extensions to mixed ploidy gene order phylogenies. We apply this to the study of the ""Saccharomyces complex"" of yeast species.

    In comparing genomic maps, we introduce the notion of partially ordered genomes to take into account missing and unresolved data, and use this to compare the genomes of various cereal species.  We also work on distinguishing mapping errors from genuine rearrangements of the genomes and we apply this to the comparison of the rice and sorghum genomes. 

    We have defined a new measure of ""generalized adjacency"" as a useful tool in computing ancestral genomes within a phylogeny.  This leads to many algorithmic and statistical questions we propose to investigate.

"The traditional telecommunications infrastructure robustness is diminishing because of two elements: the increased use of wireless technologies that, by its nature, are more vulnerable than wireline, and the convergence towards IP, which was designed with a ""best-effort"" philosophy in mind. There are obvious management advantages to this approach but it is almost certain that the reliability of this integrated system will suffer from the inadequacies of both wireless and Internet technology. This may not be a particularly pressing problem for the casual home user, but it could be very important for users that would pay to expect reliability and Quality of Service. It would be also extremely important in emergencies situations, where even if a failure did not affect directly the system, there would be a large surge of traffic. In this case, the network may be overloaded and it may happen that no communications can be relayed as it happened in recent events. These are very serious problems that have to be addressed as soon as possible before the wireless/Internet convergence is complete. In this project, we examine how some techniques currently proposed provide some forms of service guarantees in the wired Internet that can be used to improve robustness. An additional difficulty is that these techniques must be made to work with wireles technology, a problem that has not been examined so far. This is very important since in a few years, we could have a completely Internet-based network with a large population of wireless users. It could very well happen that in an emergency situation, none of these users, including relief and security workers, could access the network, because of the general overload caused by the emergency. This is clearly not an option and that is why we want to start right now to look at these issues.","Communication systems and services (planning, organization, services)","�cole Polytechnique de Montr�al",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","R�seaux de t�l�communications","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"
"The world of telecommunications has converged to IP multiservice networks . Regardless of the transmission media, such networks will provide a wide range of voice, video, TV and data services that require large amounts of bandwidth to provide the required Quality of Service (QoS).  Therefore, we are heading towards hybrid networks that function with IP over different types of wireless and wireline technologies (802.11, 802.16, UMTS, xDSL, WDM, MPLS, Ethernet, etc)  that, in most cases, must be totally transparent to the user that is requesting its quality of service.



In this complex technological context, a fundamental question is how to design and manage the networks to be able to suitably provide the QoS for each application in a cost-effective manner. 

Another important factor is the increased user dependency on the enhanced IP multiservice applications, which leads to the issues of reliability and resilience that must be addressed in the design and performance evaluation of those types of networks and technologies.



This grant application deals with the modeling and methodological issues concerning the problems of design optimization , reliability and performance assessment of telecommunication networks with new and forthcoming technologies.  These problems can give rise to large queuing, combinatorial, non-linear and  hybrid structures that need the development of specialized modeling, simulation and mathematical programming techniques for their resolution.

The objective of the application is two fold: 1) Find efficient modeling and resolution methods to be able to deal with real-life applications. 2) Influence, by our analysis and algorithmic proposals, some of the features of the forthcoming telecommunication technologies.

"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from immune dysregulation (autoimmunity) leading to destruction of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas (beta cells) by specific white blood cells (beta cell-killer lymphocytes). Considerable progress has been made in the last few years in the characterization of proteins from beta cells that are recognized by antibodies and beta cell-reactive white blood cells from diabetic humans and mice. However, the nature of the proteins that are recognized by beta cell-killer white blood cells (most of which express the marker CD8) have remained a mystery for a long time. With funding from NSERC, we have characterized, at the molecular level, protein targets of a dominant population of beta cell-killer white blood cells. Experiments comparing the responsiveness of na�ve versus differentiated beta cell-killer white blood CD8+ cells have revealed, quite unexpectedly, that activated lymphocytes can mount very efficient responses to molecular variants of the cognate protein that are completely unable to elicit any response on the cells' na�ve (unstimulated) precursors. We have gathered compelling evidence that the switch that controls the differential responsiveness of non-activated versus previously activated lymphocytes to different ligands maps to a set of molecules closely associated with the so-called ""T cell receptor for antigen"" on the surface of lymphocytes.  The overall objective of this competitive renewal application is to precisely define the biochemical events emanating from these molecules that are responsible for this unexpected phenomenon.

"Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is an important contributor to stroke, which is one of the leading causes of death (7%) in Canada with an estimated annual cost of $1.5 billion (including loss of productivity, and treatment) in Canada alone. PVD treatment includes intervention, surgical reconstruction or amputation. Tissue regeneration (TR) concepts have been investigated recently because of significant potential benefits for the long-term viability of reconstructed vessels. The biodegradation and resorption of scaffold structures are important elements in TR concepts today. Yet, our understanding of how the interdependence of the above two processes influence the biology of cells involved in TR remains poorly defined. In this proposal, novel TR scaffolds will be designed for peripheral arterial vascular graft applications based on designing features within the materials which could modulate the activation of human macrophages into a wound healing cell, and promote the generation of desired functional markers for vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. The long-term goal will apply the materials in vascular reconstruction, evaluating in-vivo performance for design considerations of vasoactivity, non-thrombogenicity, angiogenic function, and degradation with appropriate burst strength and porosity.

"The underlying hypothesis of this discovery grant is that model esterase biodegradation systems for oral fluids can define polymeric biomaterial structures that will enable the design of biostable tooth restorative materials, as well as biodegradable scaffolds with peptide function for regenerating functional mucosal tissues.  There will be 3 main themes to this discovery grant.  Previous work by the PI has identified the most potent enzyme complexes in oral salivary fluids which are responsible for the biochemical breakdown of traditional polymeric composite materials used in tooth restorations. It is an objective of the renewal discovery grant to use model enzyme systems for the above enzyme complexes to methodically identify novel monomeric structures that could be used to conceive highly biostable and antimicrobial tooth restorative materials.  In other work the investigator's lab has demonstrated that it is possible to modulate the biological function of bacteria at the molecular level with the release of low ppm to ppb levels of degradation products from composite polymers.  Therefore, this renewal discovery grant will explore the synthesis of new monomers to generate composite materials which could release antimicrobial agents while fulfilling their functional role as a tooth filling.   The last research theme will explore the fabrication of micro-porous scaffold structures that could support mucosal soft tissue cells.This work will emphasis 3 principle design parameters, believed to be essential in the ultimate goal of regenerating soft tissue in the oral cavity, including monomer conversion, biodegradation rates and cell proliferation within the 3-dimensional scaffolds.  These materials may ultimately be used to restore tissue damaged by age, genetic and environmental related illnesses.  The findings from this grant will provide a greater mechanistic understanding for the influence of monomer chemical structure on the physical, biochemical and biological outcomes of biomaterials, intended for a health related area (i.e. the oral-health sciences) that has physical, psychological/societal, and economic impact on Canadians.  These polymers may also have potential uses in biological delivery concepts for agriculture and environmental management systems.

"The major objective of my research program has been to contribute to the general area of cognitive science by increasing our understanding of how animals encode and retain information. Time and number, along with space, constitute fundamental dimensions which animals must effectively utilize in order to survive and reproduce. The primary focus of my research has been on laboratory-based behavioural investigations designed to further our understanding how pigeons and rats process both temporal and numerical information. The proposed research will primarily focus on behavioural studies in pigeons and rats designed to further clarify (1) the way in which stimulus properties impact temporal perception and how experimental conditions affect the expression of these effects; (2) the mechanisms underlying animals' encoding and memory of temporal information; and (3) whether pigeons have metamemory for temporal information. Understanding the effects of stimulus properties on temporal processing, the way in which animals process temporal information, and the capacities and limitations for metacognition in animals will mark a significant advancement in our understanding of animal cognition at a functional level and should also contribute to neurobiological investigations of these processes in nonhuman animals.

"Celestial mechanics has historically served as a source of mathematical discovery and new problems.  This is still true today where the contemporary needs of space science bring a new wave of interest in the theoretical and practical aspects of celestial mechanics making its connections with mathematics and applications stronger than ever before. One of the main aspects of celestial mechanics is the study of the Newtonian N-body problem, namely the analysis of the motion of N point particles in a setting where the dynamics are dictated by Newton's law of motion. The study of the N-body problem now includes just about any dynamical system that remotely resembles the Newtonian N-body problem, and beyond the insight it provides in astronomy and space science it  has many applications in science and engineering. 

My research program has two main directions. The first concerns investigations of a theoretical nature. The second emphasizes applied aspects. From the theoretical point of view I am interested in studying properties of some special solutions of the N-body problem (i.e. homographic motions and relative equilibria) and the special configurations that are allowed in such motions (i.e. central configurations). The study of central configurations is important because they play a ``central role"" in understanding N-body behavior: they characterize the dynamical behavior of collisions and expansions and play a key role in the topology of the integral manifolds of the N-body problem. From a more application oriented  point of view my research program is directed towards developing numerical methods that improve computational efficiency and permit new systems to be simulated with greater accuracy. Additionally, I am interested in analyzing several aspects of the full-body problems.  This is a fascinating class of problems that has many open questions and touches on numerous important issues in science and engineering,  as for example binary asteroids, the dynamics of the Earth-Moon system, reaction and ionization of molecules, stability and control of underwater vehicles and  rendezvous  and docking of space vehicles.

"My research program is concerned with the ""computational"" aspects of working in a system of autonomous mobile entities.  The entities could be software agents moving on the net, or robots moving on a terrain.  We want the entities to be identical, simple, ""disposable"", so we can create them  inexpensively and easily replace damaged or ""lost"" ones. At the same time we want them to be able, collectively, to solve complex tasks. In other words, the capabilities lie within the ""team"".  The computational concerns are correctness and efficiency; that is, question like: what problems can be solved ? under what conditions ? at what cost ?



This project focuses on problems and issues that arise  in these environments; they range from  locating  black holes (harmful hosts that destroys incoming agents),  to decontaminating a network being infected by  a mobile intruder (e.g. a virus), from gathering autonomous mobile vehicles (e.g., tanks) dispersed on a terrain, to scattering mobile sensors on a terrain so to obtain a uniformly coverage of the space (e.g., for surveillance). 

In spite of the differences, the same fundamental principles occur in all these contexts. Their study is the primary goal of this project.

"My research project intends to take advantage of the availability of new satellite navigation signals in geodetic

positioning and precise navigation. Ongoing enhancements on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)

include the modernization of the U. S. Global Positioning System (GPS), the re-birth of the Russian

GLONASS and the implementation of the highly anticipated European Community Galileo. Recently, the

Chinese government started launching satellites in order to build their own navigation satellite system, Beidou.

This system is not considered in the scope of this document. Each one of these systems (GPS, GLONASS and

Galileo) has their own observable types, with different frequencies allocated to them. During the time when

GPS was the sole satellite system, only 2 frequencies were available. With the modernization of GPS and the

birth of other satellite systems, more frequencies are offered. The consequence of a larger number of

frequencies is that more opportunities are open not only to have positioning in a more challenging

environment, such as urban canyons and operating under multipath, but also to address the same problems

addressed before with two frequencies in a novel way, such as in dealing with the ionosphere. I want to

continue with my current research taking advantage of the growing availability of GNSS satellite signals.

Currently, in addition to the original GPS two-frequencies, there is the second civilian code (L2C), an

experimental Galileo signal, plus the GLONASS signals. During the timeframe of this Discovery Grant, it is

expected that the new L5 GPS frequency will be made available as well as more Galileo satellites launched.

My research project intends to take advantage of the availability of these new signals in order to investigate

their application in precise geodetic positioning and navigation by:

- taking advantage of multi-constellation inter-frequency combinations targeting ambiguity resolution,

ionospheric delay modelling and multipath mitigation;

- investigate the applicability of hydrostatic delay modelling based on numerical weather prediction models in

a multi-constellation scenario;

- investigate an alternative bootstrapping technique for orbit improvement which takes into account the

multi-constellation;

- push the limit in network-based high-accuracy geodetic positioning targeting the realization of the ITRS.

For these purposes, I plan to continue working on enhancements of in-house software suites, GAPS, for precise

point positioning, and DIPOP, for relative positioning.

In addition to using real signals, I intend to continue using simulated signals coming from various sources,

"Hyperpolarized Noble Gases (HNG), specifically helium-3 and xenon-129, have significantly expanded the capability of Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging in recent years, most notably for visualizing human lung anatomy and function. HNG MR imaging offers several important advantages: (i) safety, (ii) high spatial and temporal resolution and (iii) functional information. A further novel feature of HNG is that the optimal image quality is achieved at magnetic field strengths substantially lower than most conventional MR imaging systems. Low field can reduce MR complexity and costs, allow new ""open magnet"" geometries for reduced claustrophobia and permit exploration of the effects of posture on lung physiology. Furthermore, the substantially increased transverse relaxation times available at low fields provides a unique opportunity to measure fundamental long-range gas diffusion and rapid oxygenation changes in the lung not possible at high fields. The objectives of the proposed research are: i) to optimize a low field MR imaging system; ii) to develop mathematical models of the relationships between measured low field HNG parameters and the anatomical and physiological properties of the lung (surface area, airway sizes, inflammation and oxygenation); iii) to develop and validate new low field HNG MR imaging methods sensitive to rodent models of lung disease. The proposed research will take place at the low field hyperpolarized MR imaging laboratory at the University of Western Ontario (Robarts Research Institute) established in part with previous NSERC Discovery funding. The research plan will bring together the expertise of the low field hyperpolarized MR imaging laboratory in the production and delivery of HNG in vivo, hardware and software development and mathematical modeling with the expertise of the Physics Department at UWO in pulsed-field MR hardware and the expertise of the UWO School of Medicine and Dentistry in the development of experimental models of lung disease in rodents. The significance of the proposed research is high as low field HNG MRI is entirely novel and therefore will provide significant opportunities for knowledge generation, both basic and applied.

"With the start of LHC this fall, a decade of dramatic discoveries in Particle Physics arise on the horizon. If LHC unmasks a strongly interacting sector, Holography would be an essential tool to interpret data. 

Holography, a relatively new tool, is based on the observation that some strongly interacting systems can be qualitatively described by means of weakly coupled systems in higher dimensions. Nowadays, many examples of this duality are known in various physical systems, among which low-energy QCD, heavy-ion physics, cuprate superconductors, graphene, Fermi gases and superfluidity.

Using the holographic approach, one can match scenarios of strong electroweak symmetry breaking with theories in more than 4 dimensions with different geometries. The parameter space of models can be explored systematically, while keeping the number of parameters to its minimum-- a requirement for collider studies. 

Holography is a useful organizing tool but it will not the last word. Full understanding will come from the interplay of Holographic methods with Lattice for Beyond the Standard Model Physics.�

"The patterns of clouds in the sky, the wind-sculpted striations in the desert sand, the spots and stripes of animal skin are examples of patterns that emerge spontaneously in nature. The physical laws that govern spontaneous

pattern formation in these dissimilar systems are strikingly similar. Any system that is unstable (prone to change) will spontaneously transform in an attempt to reach its most stable state (equilibrium). Patterns emerge if during its evolution towards equilibrium, the system is subjected to two opposing forces. Our research

examines such nonlinear phenomena when a system simultaneously undergoes optical and chemical changes. Because their properties can be easily modified and measured, these systems provide accessible opto-chemical routes to complex nonlinear processes. We have discovered a richly diverse suite of nonlinear phenomena including self-trapped beams of laser light and separately, white light, which travel without broadening over unexpectedly long distances and the spontaneous formation of patterns in large uniform beams of white light.

The research proposed in this application is stimulated by these findings and seeks to understand complex and nascent topics in nonlinear phenomena including the (i) particle-like interactions of self-trapped beams of light, (ii) the emergence of nonlinear optical shock waves that propagate without dissipating, (iii) the spontaneous formation of ordered 2 and 3-dimensional lattices with incoherent white light, itself an inherently disordered system, (iv) the behaviour of self-trapped beams propagating in periodic lattices and (v) theoretical modelling that will help understand and predict these phenomena. In addition, we plan to develop new types of photoresponsive materials to broaden the search for other forms of nonlinear light propagation. This research will elucidate the fascinating and often counterintuitive properties of nonlinear light forms and contribute to fundamental knowledge in this highly active and competitive research field. Personnel participating in this research will receive extensive optical and chemical training, which is valuable in both academic and industrial R&D settings.

"Semiconductors are the foundation of the information age. Computers run on silicon. The Internet's fiber-optic backbone uses beams of light generated in InGaAsP lasers. Digital cameras register images in silicon sensors for visible light, or InGaAs photodetector arrays when infrared night vision is needed.

    Pure, perfect crystals are the basis of much of today's semiconductor technology. However, the equipment to grow single-crystal semiconductors is costly, as is its operation, especially in view of the dangerous reagents that are often required.

    We propose herein to advance our work in solution-processed optoelectronics. We have recently shown that spin-cast infrared optical sensors can outperform their perfectly single-crystal counterparts. Now we seek, through the present proposal, to deepen understanding of the operation of solution-processed optoelectronic devices; and to use this understanding to improve device performance through rational control.

    We will put forth and experimentally validate a model of the origins of responsivity and noise inside our solution-processed photoconductive photodetectors; demonstrate experimental control, through materials processing, over the structural and electronic properties of materials; and use this control to demonstrate rational engineering of photodetector performance towards to specific application-oriented goals.

    In sum, we will pursue the materials chemistry, processing, and device physics to make it practical to achieve high-yielding, consistent, optoelectronic devices tailored to particular applications. At a scientific level, the research will yield insights into the controlled manipulation of colloidal quantum dot bulk materials and surfaces. At an applied level, the research will lead to record-performance devices (one for visible-wavelength video-frame-rate operation, the other tailored to night-vision applications) for imaging. The project will, through the insights it generates, also provide foundational scientific support to our parallel activity in the commercialization of our solution-processed photodetector technology.

"The rapid diversification of the flowering plants is one of the most remarkable patterns in nature.  This group appears to be a classic example of an adaptive radiation, with an estimated 300 to 3600-fold difference in species number between the angiosperms and its sister lineage.  My research interests lie in exploring the ecological and evolutionary processes that have shaped diversity in the flowering plants.  Through past research I have contributed to our understanding of the role natural selection has played in trait diversification in this group, in addition to studying the role specific traits, such as floral shape, have played in generating disparity in species richness among angiosperm lineages. In the next stage of my research I will expand existing theory on the role of animal pollinators in angiosperm diversification from a focus on local scale processes to a broader perspective that includes regional and community level processes. I will also draw on my experience using phylogenetic comparative methods to disentangle the role that herbivores and animal pollinators have played in the diversification of the angiosperms. Furthermore, I will initiate experimental systems to explore how a plant's adaptive response to other species in the community and/ or habitat heterogeneity influences the evolution of plant-pollinator specialization. In summary, the goal of my research is to understand past and present processes that promote diversification in floral traits, species coexistence, and ultimately, differences in species richness.  I approach these questions using innovative tools such as phylogenetics and mathematical models, as well as more traditional methods such as field experiments in order to better understand the processes that have shaped flowering plant diversity.

"Winter cereals regulate their development through two important evolutionary adaptive mechanisms: vernalization and freezing tolerance (FT). Vernalization postpones the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase, allowing plants to overwinter before flowering under favourable conditions for sexual reproduction. This process is closely associated with cold acclimation (CA) and the development of FT. Using different molecular and genomic approaches, several low temperature(LT) and vernalization responsive genes were identified from freezing tolerant wheat and rye in our laboratory. Expression analyses demonstrated that several genes are differentially expressed in winter and spring genotypes and their expression was associated with the vernalization response and the capacity of wheat cultivars and other cereal species to develop FT.  Molecular and genetic studies designed to explain this differential expression have demonstrated that the level and duration of gene expression determine the degree of FT and depend on the vernalization response. As a consequence, the less tolerant spring cultivars, which do not require vernalization, cannot maintain the LT responsive genes in an up-regulated state. This limits their ability to achieve the same levels of FT as the vernalization responsive hardy winter cultivars. These genes and their products may have an important function in conferring FT and controlling flowering time. The basic goal of this research program is to understand the complex genetic mechanisms that control FT and vernalization. To achieve this goal, we will focus on the following objectives: 1) Identify the regulatory networks modulating the response to LT and vernalization in cereals, 2) Determine the mechanisms regulating the genetic links between vernalization and CA, 3) Identify microRNA(s) involved in FT and floral development.

"The attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins plays important regulatory tasks in eukaryotic cell processes. One of the effects of protein ubiquitination is degradation by the 26S proteasome. Protein ubiquitination is both dynamic and reversible. The ubiquitination of target proteins can be reversed by the action of deubiquitinating enzymes. The roles of the enzymes involved in deubiquitination are not well understood. One class of these enzymes is known as ubiquitin specific proteases (UBPs or USPs) which are large multidomain proteins ranging in size from 50 to 300 kDa. Ubiquitin specific proteases are involved in the removal of ubiquitin molecules from specific target proteins therefore sequence variation in the non-catalytic domains can provide target protein specificity to individual ubiquitin specific proteases. There are several examples in the literature that demonstrate the importance of ubiquitin specific proteases in cellular functions. One of the most studied is USP7. USP7 regulates the levels of p53 and mdm2 proteins by deubiquitination once they have been targeted for degradation by ubiquitination. The USP7 protein is found in a large number of eukaryotes ranging from yeast to humans. I will focus most of my research on UBP15, the yeast homolog of USP7. I would like to identify and biochemically characterize proteins that interact with UBP15 in order to provide insight into the functional role of UBP15. A combination of binding, mutagenesis and structural studies will follow the initial identification of interacting proteins. One of the goals of this proposal is to determine the structure of the C-terminal domain of UBP15. Another goal of this project is to study deubiquitination in greater detail in yeast especially the structural basis of ubiquitin-specific proteases-substrate interactions. As a starting point, I propose to determine crystal structures of the domains of the other yeast ubiquitin specific proteases. Since the ubiquitin specific proteases are all predicted to contain one or more specificity domains, insight into the nature of substrate recognition will be beneficial to the overall characterization of these proteins. The significance of this research will be to enhance our understanding of deubiquitination in cellular function.

"Natural language is the main repository of human knowledge, and with the advent of large amounts of readily available machine-readable natural language text such as the web and newswire feeds, there has been a steady increase in the number of computational applications that attempt to extract information from these sources. 



The field of natural language processing now has a well-developed suite of approaches that use supervised machine learning. However, adapting to a new domain or a new language, especially a language with insufficient data, is still a major bottleneck when building software applications that process natural language. This proposal aims to address this crucial issue by exploring the use of semi-supervised machine learning methods for natural language, which can learn even when only a small amount of training data is available.



Here are two examples of benefits from this research: First, by using domain-general information about English and then adapting to a specialized language, such as bio-medical research papers, natural language applications can be used to extract information in this new domain. Second, machine translation systems are trained on sentences previously translated by human translators, but such translations are only available in large quantities in a domain like parliament proceedings, e.g. the French-English Canadian Hansards. But this domain is not well suited to build a machine translation system for another domain, e.g. political weblogs. Our research enables translation systems to adapt to this new domain. Our research also enables machine translation in a domain where only small amounts of training data are available, e.g. the Nunavut Hansards.

"While new broadband communication technologies and services are rapidly evolving, channel  modeling techniques that are essential prerequisites for wireless network planning have  not followed a similar pace. As a result, the gap between the needs of wireless communication  engineers and the capabilitities of current software tools, such as ray-tracing, is continuously  expanding. The proposed equipment is necessary for the development of a research program that  is aimed at closing this gap, by integrating mathematical advances with hardware acceleration to  produce and experimentally validate novel ray-tracing algorithms for large-scale channel simulations. 





Two complementary items are requested. The first item is a graphics processor unit (GPU) workstation  that will enable the applicant's group to investigate the implementation of advanced wireless channel  ray-tracing based methodologies in graphics processors. Moreover, a high-speed digital sampling oscilloscope (DSO) is proposed. The scope will be embedded in an ultra-wideband channel  characterization system, which will be employed in a comprehensive effort to experimentally validate our  theoretical work.

"For many years, research on Computational Electromagnetics has focused on improving the modeling of  building blocks for complex, real-world systems. The results of this effort are reflected in a whole generation of simulators, which are now indispensable high-frequency design and analysis tools. However, significant, long-standing problems, which still exist in this area, limit our ability to design and understand wave phenomena of interest, especially those that include multiple temporal and spatial frequency scales. The proposed project offers innovative solutions to this class of multiscale problems. 



The fundamental component of any multiscale simulation scheme is adaptive mesh refinement, or the variability of the distance (in space and time) between the unknown quantities determined by a numerical solver.  A fresh approach to the problem of introducing mesh refinement into high-order accurate finite-difference solvers for Maxwell's equations is proposed. By means of the metric invariance property of Maxwell's equations, the formulation of adaptive mesh refinement, high-order methods with provable stability properties,  can be performed through a straightforward, robust process. The proposed technique will also be embedded in a framework that allows high-order mesh refinement to dynamically adapt to the spatio-temporal evolution of electromagnetic fields in a certain problem. Thus, the efficiency of mesh refinement, complemented by the accuracy of high-order methods will produce a novel class of powerful numerical electromagnetic schemes tailored to effectively address challenging multiscale applications.



While these fundamental advances can be applied to several engineering problems, two areas will be specifically targeted: the modeling of  plasmonic structures for optical  meta-material applications, and the study of hybrid microwave-acoustic medial imaging.

"Multimedia streaming spans a wide range of network applications, from video conferencing and voice over IP(VoIP) to TV broadcasting over the Internet (IP-TV). Streaming, as current estimates suggest, accounts for more than a quarter of the overall Internet traffic. As such, efficient solutions to media streaming problem have the potential to directly impact the Internet's bandwidth economy. Current streaming solutions essentially separate network media communication into two layers: media compression layer and network communication layer. In contrast, the proposed research aims at developing new solutions that go beyond the current, layered, approaches. The development of these new solutions is based on the realization that there is an inherent loss of performance when media processing and network delivery methods are designed separately. By a joint consideration of source compression and network communication, our developed solutions will be able to utilize available network infrastructures and bandwidth resources more efficiently. To realize this potential, an optimization framework will be developed that captures the complex entanglement of source coding and network communication. The objective of such optimization will be to maximize a collective measure of quality of service to all network clients, given the bandwidth constraints of the underlying network. Well studied network communication strategies (e.g., routing or network coding) and source coding elements (e.g., progressive coding or more general multiple description coding) will be jointly optimized within this framework. Simple examples (such as the one reported in te proposal) suggest that the impact of using these new approaches to digital multimedia distribution can be significant.

Finally, The proposed research will be more than a pursue in efficient algorithms and network protocols. It will also provide new insights into the innate correlation of source coding and network communication and the fundamental tradeoffs between the quality of service possible to different network clients, and advances the scientific knowledge on network communication of compressible sources.

"This research aims at devising a decision support environment for software developers and maintainers in an organization, in order to enable them to monitor the structural and behavioral aspects of the system and to provide recommendations, alerts, and warnings with regard to maintaining specific software qualities. The proposed environment takes advantage of modern technologies to specify and synthesize customizable decision-flow diagrams as guideline models that encode the best practices developed in the organization or  established in the software maintenance literature. The guideline model is then executed to interactively direct the flow of decision from the root node of the decision-flow diagram to a leaf node, where a decision is made and the user is notified. 

At each node of the decision-flow diagram, various types of information can be supplied to the guideline model. These types of information are categorized as either ""system information"", including system's static, dynamic, or design related data and relations, or as ""mined knowledge"", in the form of patterns and trends, including: association rules, execution trace patterns, generalizations, and clusters, that are extracted from the ""system information"" by the means of data mining algorithms. The guideline model then provides 

different types of recommendations or alerts, as well as a list of possible next steps in the decision-flow diagram for the user to choose from. The guideline models can specify different software maintenance activities such as: corrective, perfective, adaptive, or preventive operations that ensure a healthy software system asset for the respective organization throughout its development and evolution stages. The key characteristics of the proposed environment include the incorporation of mined knowledge that ensures sophistication of the approach, as well as customization and ease of use that ensures adoption by the software maintainers of the organizations in different application domains.

"During the past century, a revolution has occurred in the understanding of the structure of matter.  We have moved well into examination of the myriad of complexity contained inside atoms - proposed as ""indivisible"" in 1805 by Dalton - from molecular structures, to electron orbitals around a nuclear center, to the structure of the atomic nucleus itself.  In 1932, the discovery of the neutron brought acceptance to the idea that the atomic nucleus is composed of elementary particles called neutrons and protons (or ""nucleons""); further, during the 1970's, experimental results made it clear that even these nucleons are individually made of more fundamental particles called quarks and gluons.  Modern nuclear physics researchers now strive to gain clear insight into understanding the interactions between these underlying quarks and gluons, and how these interactions give rise to the internal structure properties of nucleons.  While a very good theoretical framework (called Quantum Chromo Dynammics, or QCD) exists which can accurately describe how quarks and gluons interact at extremely high energies (or, equivalently, when the quarks are very close together), an unfortunate reality is that this theory of QCD is very difficult to solve/interpret at lower energies (or, at larger distances) because the quark/gluon force gets increasingly complicated as they get further apart.  However, this complicated interaction of quarks and gluons is manifest by the rich structure which nucleons have been measured to possess; while it's clear such nucleon structure results from the motion of its internal electrically-charged quarks, the exact connection of the observed low-energy structure of nucleons to the underlying theory of QCD remains one of the central problems of modern physics research.  This research proposal will exploit the existing 6-billion-Volt electron beam at Jefferson Laboratory in the USA to make precision measurements of low-energy proton structure, as well as contribute to designing/constructing new scintillating-fiber tracking detectors to be used in studies to push these proton structure measurements up in energy as Jefferson Lab enters a construction phase to increase its electron beam energy to 12-billion-Volts.

"Non-invasive optical imaging technology is rapidly emerging for visualization of the retina, located at the back of the eye. An exciting area of research is retinal imaging for small animals, where the poor optical systems of the eye introduce significant challenges for high resolution imaging. Dr. Sarunic is investigating multi-modal retinal imaging in small animals using novel combinations of Fourier Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (FDOCT), a unique non-contact imaging modality for high resolution cross sectional visualization of sub-surface tissue, and confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (cSLO), for detection of fluorescence. Dr. Sarunic is actively involved in research collaborations with visual scientists across Canada to investigate retinal imaging instrumentation required to improve our understanding of retinal diseases, and to accelerate the development of therapy to prevent vision loss or to potentially restore vision through regenerative medicine.

    The objective this proposal is to build on recent exciting research results from small animal retinal imaging, and is required upgrade the existing prototype to provide ultrahigh resolution in order to provide accurate and quantitative measurements of retinal degeneration and to observe autofluorescent deposits in the retina associated with specific diseases. The equipment requested constitutes the optical engine of a unique ultrahigh resolution FDOCT system with axial resolution <1.2micrometers. Adaptive optics are required to compensate for refractive aberrations introduced by the highly curved surfaces of the cornea and lenses of small animals, and to obtain narrow point spread function at the retina. The adaptive optics is critical for high resolution imaging with both FDOCT and fluorescent cSLO. The ultrahigh resolution non-invasive retinal imaging system will be investigated for advancing visual science, permitting longitudinal studies of retinal degeneration and acceleration drug development and gene therapy. This research program provides hands-on training in biomedical imaging systems for highly qualified personal, and introduces them to a highly interdisciplinary research environment, spanning biomedical optics and visual science.

"Biomedical imaging using light is an exciting area of research for high resolution structural and functional visualization of cells and tissues in vivo. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides non-destructive micrometer scale resolution cross sectional images of tissue which are directly comparable to histology. Recently, a significant increase in attainable OCT system sensitivity has been identified by the use of spectrally resolved Fourier domain (FD) detection. In addition to novel system level benefits for functional imaging, FD OCT facilitates high speed scanning while maintaining high image quality. 

     The objective of this research proposal is to further extend the uses of OCT outside its traditional niche application in ophthalmology using novel systems and techniques enabled by Fourier domain detection. FD OCT has strong potential as an optical imaging modality both for biomedical imaging of small model animals and developmental biology. To achieve wide acceptance as the preferred imaging modality, functional extensions are required for OCT to enable tissue identification and visualization of biological processes. Investigation of molecular contrast imaging is proposed using spectroscopic techniques and fluorescence self-interference in combination with Fourier domain detection. Research into minimum diameter fiber-based endoscopic probes for light delivery in specialized clinical applications will also be investigated. 

     Another functional extension enabled by FD OCT is nanometer-scale axial resolution, referred to in the literature as Spectral Domain Phase Microscopy (SDPM). The second branch of this research proposal investigates integration of SDPM with nano-optical microscopy, providing an avenue to improve image resolution in all three dimensions. The nano-aperture imaging system measures differences in light transmission through a sub-wavelength diameter hole caused by interaction with a sample. Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) will be investigated for the manipulation and positioning of cells to develop a highly integrated microscope-on-a-chip imaging system.","Biomedical engineering","Simon Fraser University",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie biom�dical","G�nie biom�dical"

"1) The study of surface water-groundwater (SW-GW) interactions plays an important role in effective management of water resources as well as fisheries and aquatic resources. Natural exchange between surface waters and underlying aquifer can strongly influence the temperature and chemical conditions as well as the ecological status of the surface waters; There is a shortage of reliable information about SW-GW interactions mainly due to a lack of quality data and related to the difficulty in collecting such data.  In order to understand (and quantify) SW-GW mechanisms and processes, good quality data are required and numerical modeling of fundamental hydrological processes need to be developed for specific sites.



2) Effective and efficient monitoring of groundwater pollution is essential for groundwater quality management.  The most important aspect of groundwater pollution management is to determine the spatial and temporal extent of pollutant plume movements. It is proposed to develop a methodology for optimal design of a dynamic (evolving with time) monitoring well network and to evaluate its potential applicability by validating with data from case studies.



3) Water intake is usually designed to withdraw water for municipal and industrial uses, including pump intakes and other hydraulic structures. Vortex formation can lead to inefficient pump. Extensive experiments will be conducted to describe flow characteristics in a circular intake with multiple pumps. A CFD code will be formulated to accommodate rectangular, circular, and generally irregular natural basin boundaries. Apart from yielding a wealth of information for future designers, it also creates an opportunity to validate the proposed numerical model.

"Sweetening and dehydration plants can be engineered today to operate as efficiently as possible based on their fundamental thermodynamic constraints determined by the amount of energy required for solvent recovery and water disposal. 



The opportunity to enhance the operation of gas processing plants hinges on the ability to find new solvents for sweetening and dehydration and therefore change the thermodynamic constraints of the standard designs. The search for this ideal solvent for sweetening and dehydration is bound by the desired characteristics of this chemical, namely high affinity towards hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide, high affinity towards water, low vapor pressure, thermal stability and chemical stability. This solvent should also be relatively inexpensive to produce and present low or at least well understood toxicity. In addition, this solvent must present favorable physical properties for efficient plant operation such as relatively low viscosity and reasonably high solute diffusivity for efficient contactor design.

 

The physical and chemical characteristics of this ideal solvent for natural gas sweetening and dehydration seem to be matched by a class of compounds called ionic liquids. Ionic liquids (IL) are essentially complex organic salts that are liquid at relatively low temperatures. The objectives of this work are the development of basic computational chemistry knowledge to allow efficient screening and eventual selection or design of an alternative solvent for natural gas conditioning and the measurement of physical and thermodynamic properties important for the design of separation equipment used in gas conditioning plants.

"The proposed project will use innovative methods to develop a 600 year (1500 to 2100 A.D.) record of the hydroclimate of the North Saskatchewan River basin above Edmonton, Alberta. This database and our interpretation of the hydrological cycles and their causes will assist our industrial partner, EPCOR Water Services Inc., with preparation for the impacts of climate change on water supplies. The major risk from climate warming in Canada's western interior is a change in the availability of water resources, including the timing of supplies and distribution among basins. The dramatic retreat of glaciers from the Rocky Mountains reflects the earlier loss of the annual snowpack that is the main source of runoff in western Canada. Demand

for water resources is expected to rise significantly with growth in population and economic activity, and increased water loss by evapotranspiration. Scientists have projected mean states of future climate and surface water supplies, but there remains a critical research and knowledge gap: the characteristics and causes of short-term variability in surface water balances and the adaptation to resource management practices that will be required to sustain water use, allocation and apportionment under a changed hydrologic regime. The proposed strategic project addresses this knowledge gap by modeling past, recent and future flows of the North Saskatchewan River using methods that capture the natural short-term variability that will underlie the trend imposed by global warming. Wet and dry cycles have significant implications for the management of land and water resources. A better understanding of the impacts of climate change will require scenarios of future hydrologic variability, and of the path that climate and hydrology will take from present to future conditions as water balances cycle above and below trends in mean conditions. This project represents a major opportunity for the industrial partner to collaborate with researchers, in the early and less costly stages of adaptation to climate change, and to generate new scientific information that can influence decision making about planned adaptation.",Water,"University of Regina",2,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Eau de surface",Hydrologie

"MULTISCALE METHODS FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING AND IMAGE SYNTHESIS:  We propose a research program in two parts that share a multiscale / multipoint approach to signal and image processing: (I) Multiscale Principal Components (MPC) for signal and image processing and (II) The Patchwork Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (PSSA).

PART I (MPC): We have been developing a data-adaptive generalization of wavelets that we call multiscale principal components (MPC). MPC are multiscale orthogonal bases that can adapt to the class of signals considered. For some classes of signals, we have shown that MPC can perform much better than wavelets in data compression and noise filtering. We propose to pursue the development of our MPC. Our objectives are: to develop high-density MPC to get a better representation of localized patterns and improve performance in data compression and noise filtering experiments; to develop two-dimensional MPC.

PART II (PSSA): The availability of high-resolution images and remotely sensed data creates the need for more realistic statistical models of the spatial distribution of various quantities, e.g. oil, water or ore. Models are required that can reproduce accurately both the rich statistical and morphological properties of such spatial distributions. These models are essential for resource assessment and risk management. We have been developing a new and very promising multipoint stochastic simulation approach called the Patchwork Stochastic Simulation Approach (PSSA). The PSSA is based on reference images that are decomposed into sub-images (patches) that are assembled to create new images. The art lies in the assembly procedure. We propose to pursue the development of our PSSA to obtain an accurate control of the image multipoint statistics and to introduce conditioning to pre-existing data in the simulations.

"The functional integrity of the intestinal epithelium in the developing and adult digestive tract relies on a tight control of proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, as well as morphogenesis of various epithelial cell populations.  These events are dictated by a concerted interplay between growth factors signals produced by epithelial and surrounding mesenchymal cells. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pleiotropic factor of mesenchymal cell origin, which is well known to promote and maintain tissue organization of various vital organs.  HGF accomplishes its functions through the specific activation of the Met receptor present at the cell surface of epithelial cells.  Biological processes regulated by the Met/HGF receptor axis include epithelial cells proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, as well as morphogenesis. Several lines of evidence suggest that the Met/HGF receptor axis may play key functions in the development and renewal of the intestinal epithelium.  However, because of the early embryonic death of HGF or Met receptor-deficient mice, little is known about the specific role of HGF and the Met/HGF receptor in the regulation of these events  The overall objective of my research program is to define the function of HGF and the Met receptor in the formation and renewal of the intestinal epithelium.  For this we will exploit various cellular and molecular biological approaches applied to various epithelial models to define mechanistically the intracellular signaling pathways downstream of the Met receptor that are implicated in biological processes fundamental to the developmental morphogenesis and the renewal of the intestinal epithelium.

"According to the Canadian Food Inspection agency, there are 11 millions cases of food borne illnesses every year. Spinach and carrot juice made the headlines this fall for that reason. To improve the control of microorganims in our food supply, we must understand the efficacy of antimicrobial systems and the microbial physiological response to them at the molecular level. 



Microorganisms respond to sublethal treatments and stresses by inducing the synthesis of a subset of proteins referred to as stress proteins. Several stress proteins have been identified for various stresses and some are even induced by more than one stress. Consumer's demands for convenient, minimally processed, safer foods with extended shelf life, have been best achieved through the application of multiple antimicrobial systems referred to as the ""hurdle technology"". However, our research on ""Adaptation of Lactobacillus alimentarius to environmental stresses"" revealed that survival level is different when the antimicrobial systems are applied in different orders. Best results are obtained when the ""hurdles"" are applied simultaneously (Lemay et al., 2000. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 55:249-253). These results suggest that pre-induction of stress proteins, or the general stress response (ex. RpoS), contributes to a better resistance and adaptation of microorganisms. Our attempt is to demonstrate that, depending on their specific function in the cell, certain stress proteins may provide cross protection to stresses that do not necessary induce their production. Because not all the antimicrobial systems are used simultaneously in food processing, it is important to study cross protection and microbial adaptation between antimicrobial systems. Ultimately, optimal combinations of antimicrobial systems will be determined.



In line with NSERC vision to serve all Canadians, this research will have a positive impact on socio-economic aspects of our agri-food industry and in public health through a reduction of food borne outbreaks.

The set of symmetries of a relational  structure is the group 

of automorphisms of the structure which acts on the base set 

of the  structure. A group acting on a set induces relations

on the set via the orbits of n-tuples. It turns then out that 

various properties of certain relational structures are determined 

by permutation group properties. In various settings, the symmetries of 

of a structure determine properties of the structure and hence 

can be viewed as properties of the set of symmetries themselves.



In this context, the proposed research will study in particular 

partition properties of structures, that is Ramsey properties and 

explore further the application of results in this area to properties of

metric spaces and possibly also Banach spaces, for example oscillation

stability. 



The properties of relational structures referred to above relate to

the category of embeddings of relational structures. Homomorphism

categories of structures lead to a different but not entirely unrelated 

set of problems for relational structures which in the case of finite 

structures are of interest with respect to optimization results. To describe

the homomorphism category of  given types of relational structures constitutes 

then the second part of the research proposal.

"Biological diversity is essential for healthy ecosystems and is a key component of a nation's wealth.

My major research focus is the elucidation of algal relationships emphasizing two ecologically and economically important groups - red (primary) and brown (secondary) seaweeds. Molecular tools are powerful for deriving both contemporary floristic checklists and assessing relationships. They are more objective and, thus, more indicative of relatedness, than are anatomical expressions that may be influenced by convergent evolution or the environment in the form of plasticity. Specific objectives: To: 1) use molecular tools (DNA barcoding) to establish the first comprehensive list of red and brown algae for Canadian waters; 2) use molecular systematic tools to elucidate the evolutionary relationships within and among orders of these two major lineages with wide representation of the Canadian flora; 3) assess the evolution of red algal characteristics (e.g., vegetative and reproductive anatomy, life history pattern) in light of phylogenetic hypotheses; 4) establish natural classification systems based on these phylogenies; and, 5) maintain a long-term seasonal assessment of macroalgal biodiversity along the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick to document fluctuations in species richness and abundance.  Novel expected findings: The results will provide an invaluable resource to systematists and conservationists as we attempt to appreciate algal diversity and relationships, and for industry in the search for novel products. Further, we will establish a long-term database for the region, which will better enable us to discern natural fluctuations from anthropogenic perturbations.

"We seek to acquire a laser diode thermal desorption (LDTD) interface that we have successfully used to bypass liquid chromatography for the analysis of many emerging organic contaminants. This method allows the volatilization of analytes directly into an ionization chamber (APCI) and quantification in a tandem mass spectrometer with a sample turnover below 30 sec. That approach permits some large resources savings, but has certain limitations, mainly a somewhat restricted number of analytes amenable to the LDTD method and lower performance for detection limits. We have so far adapted it to the analysis of some pharmaceuticals, steroid hormones and parabens in water, but we also have excellent results with solids such as contaminated soils, aquatic sediments and sewage sludge. We have also modified this LDTD interface to analyze volatile organic compounds in air, we have thus been able to use it for the online monitoring of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) and volatile methylsiloxanes.

"Our research activities are focused on the fate of trace contaminants in the environment. We have expanded from an initial focus on the biogeochemistry of trace elements to specifically concentrate this new program on emerging issues, such as nanoparticles, pharmaceuticals and cyanotoxins. We study this wide range of contaminants through our focus on chemical speciation and fractionation of those products to better quantify their bioavailability, their potential toxic effects and the resulting environmental risks.



Novel chemicals are developed daily and find their way into the environment. This proposal focuses on: pharmaceuticals, endocrine-disrupting chemicals and cyanotoxins using SPE-LC-MS/MS with a particular focus on particulate-bound compounds, degradation rates and byproducts and on the environmental fate of nanoparticles as they occur at low concentrations in real environmental matrices.



Our general objective is to improve our capacity to understand the fate of emerging contaminants in a variety of environmental or biological matrices. We focus on contaminants and problems for which there is little scientific literature available and/or for which we can significantly improve our understanding of the environmental problem. Because of the significant challenges in measuring many of those contaminants, initially efforts are focused on validating our analytical chemistry methods, especially with regards to the complexity of the real world matrices we have to deal with.

"Algebra is one of the oldest areas in mathematics. It encompasses a wide range of subjects from simple algebraic equations and polynomials, to linear and abstract algebra. The study of symmetries is related to a branch of algebra called group theory. For example, the set of symmetries of a physical or geometric object form what mathematicians call a group. The study of how groups act on other mathematical objects, such as sets and vector spaces, is called representation theory.



My research involves a relatively new direction in representation theory. This new approach uses geometry, rather than algebra alone, to study advanced topics in representation theory. The novel viewpoint that results allows one to use geometric techniques to examine representation theoretic topics in a new light and in some cases to prove algebraic results that mathematicians have been unable to prove using purely algebraic methods. Additionally, it also allows one to use algebra to study various geometric spaces that are of independent interest to mathematicians and theoretical physicists.



One of my aims is to further develop the field of geometric representation theory. I hope to both continue to extend geometric interpretations of algebraic results as well as examine the connection between different geometric approaches to representation theory, of which there are several. I also plan to use the tools of geometric representation theory to tackle various unsolved problems in mathematics and mathematical physics. In particular, I am studying a certain model in statistical mechanics that mathematicians do not currently understand at a satisfactory level. I expect that the new geometric viewpoint will help us to better comprehend this model.","Mathematical sciences","University of Ottawa",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Th�orie de lie","Math�matiques pures"

"Quality and reliability are becoming more and more important in many industrial, health care and everyday life situations. For example, imagine the anxiety of a person when their defibrillator-pace maker is recalled after three years when the installing surgeon said that the voltage and time interval settings had a life expectancy of 20 years.

    )	The ability of a manufacturer to design and produce a product which meets the customer's short and long term expectations is the key for success in today's market. Reliability and quality are two important expectations. Reliability typically refers to functionality, while quality refers to conformance to critical design specifications. In both cases, probability is a useful metric. The goal of the proposed research is to provide virtual, accelerated-life testing to perform the up-front selection of sizes, weights and material properties and their tolerances, to predict and finally improve, quality and reliability over the life of the product. 

    )	All products can be thought of as systems that comprise components. If the components degrade over time due to the environment and usage, then the product's performance gradually deteriorates. The ability to track performance over time leads to measures such as quality over time, mean-time to life expectancy and variances. The proposed research will examine such issues as: how to model degradation with uncertain rates, how to correlate degradation rates due to both environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) and operating conditions (applied forces) and how to make the product robust against the effects of degradation.

    )	The significance of the research is that it will provide a way to design a reliable and robust product to meet a life-time quality policy at the lowest costs (i.e. production cost and quality loss cost over time). The results of the research have wide-spread application in areas such as health care, electronics, mechatronics and micro-systems.

"Complex electronic systems are built with separate integrated circuits (ICs) affixed to printed circuit boards

(PCBs) that connect them to each other. This creates off-chip data flow bottlenecks, because the chips use

macroscopic rather than microscopic connections; this limits the number of interconnections and hence the

bandwidth. Macroscopic inter-chip connections increase power consumption and the chip package size. They

also make the circuit boards more complex and increasingly challenging to design, as inter-chip bandwidth

demand rises.

The global objective of the project is to reduce the cost and development time of these systems using a

high-density programmable system board that includes a wafer-scale integrated circuit (WaferIC). This

WaferIC consists of a very dense array of more than 2.5 million fine conducting pads that are connected

through a reconfigurable fault-tolerant interconnect network that can be set to connect any given pad to any

other. Thus ICs can be placed anywhere on the WaferIC surface, and any set of connections between the

pins/solder balls of those ICs can be dynamically configured. Hence, based on successful completion of this

research project, prototyping a high-end PCB will become simply a matter of placing chips and programming

the connections, in a matter of hours, instead of months.","Electrical and electronic machinery and equipment (including computer hardware)","�cole Polytechnique de Montr�al",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Micro�lectronique","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"
"Advanced Microsystems are designed using rich methodologies developed to deal with their complexity, and to accelerate the process of converging to correct and effective implementations that meet users' expectations and application-derived specifications. The long term goal is to elaborate methods enabling the development of integrated systems approaching the performance of custom designed dedicated hardware, with the flexibility and ease of development of software, using arrays of processors interconnected by networks on chip.



We will propose and validate methods for effective design of the digital core of high performance integrated systems based on application specific instruction-set processors. Leveraging techniques such as dynamic frequency scaling, autonomous time bases, context aware operation, and self-timed synchronization mechanisms, we will explore how to reduce the energy consumed by integrated systems. We will also propose methods and associated tools for mapping applications onto heterogeneous and homogeneous multiprocessor systems on chip. We will finally explore means through which high-performance can be reached over a broad class of applications, without developing a new application specific integrated circuit for each new product.



This research is based on extensive hardware system design experience, which will inspire metrics that can be computed on functional descriptions of an application by profiling techniques. These metrics will guide the synthesis of effective hardware implementations for applications such as video processing algorithms, visualization algorithms and distributed wireless sensor networks.

"Fungal diseases of plants are a major contributor to the world food crisis.  In Canada the loss to the wheat crop alone because of the leaf rust fungus can be $100 million annually.  The rust fungi can only be grown in the plant and are very difficult to work with.  In contrast, the related corn smut fungus, Ustilago maydis, can be easily grown and there are protocols for detailed investigation with this fungus.  So, while this fungus causes serious damage to corn crops and therefore must be understood, it also acts as a model to understand all rust and smut diseases. In my last NSERC grant we further developed the model aspect of the smut fungus through genomic analysis.  This provided better tools for investigation and the ability to transfer the knowledge we gain to other fungi. We are now in an excellent position to use these tools to investigate three areas 1) gene expression control through antisense RNA expression, 2) control of sexual reproduction and 3) plant hormone production by the fungus.  Fire and Mellow received a Nobel prize in 2006 for their discovery of antisense control of gene expression.  While the system they described is at work in most organisms, the corn smut fungus has a different way to control gene expression by antisense.  We will be figuring out what that is with the funds applied for.  Sexual reproduction by fungal pathogens shuffles virulence genes and can lead to more deadly diseases. Our goal in project 2 is to understand how sex is controlled and how interaction with the host plant leads to sexual reproduction by the smut fungus.  In project 3, I am collaborating with another Professor at Trent to determine how the smut fungus modifies the corn plant during infection.  We have evidence that the fungus does this using plant hormones, and we require the funds to figure out how.  We have the money for equipment from other funding sources, so the funds applied for here, are to support the students doing this work in the laboratory.  With the results from these three targeted areas we will provide information that can be used to develop new ways to fight fungal plant diseases.  Therefore, this research will provide great training for students and important advances for sustainable food production.

"The research program has three objectives:  1) to improve our understanding of moisture in fresh forages and crop biomass such as cereal straw and corn stover; 2) to improve instrumentation and techniques to estimate moisture rapidly and accurately, especially low-cost methods; and 3) to explore the combustion properties of low-value forages and crop biomass as potential sources of energy to replace propane and natural gas often used for artificial drying of crops and for heating of buildings.



The proposed scientific approach includes laboratory measurements of crop moisture content based mainly on electrical properties (capacitance, conductance).  Forages and crop biomass have highly variable levels of moisture content; it is important to estimate moisture content rapidly and non-destructively to take decisions with regards to drying, storage and the end-uses of these crops.  A methodical study of these crops and their response to electrical sensors and the standard oven-drying method will improve the precise estimation of moisture content at different stages of the crop, between the time it is cut and harvested, during field wilting or artificial drying, and at the end of the storage period.  Three-dimensional distribution of moisture content in bulky materials like forages and crop biomass will also be assessed, by probing with non-invasive methods.  A novel, low-cost method to estimate specific wet spots in a bulky product like hay will reduce the incidence of mold, heating and quality loss.  



The physical properties of low-grade forages and crop biomass will be assessed in terms of combustion heating value.  A systems analysis will be developed to consider appropriate furnaces, heat exchangers and areas where these low-grade crops are abundant and presently underused.  They could be used as the main source of energy for drying and heating in rural areas.

"The work concerns groups of jets or plumes in close proximity and how their interaction results in flow structures that are different from an isolated jet or plume. Three projects will be undertaken: (1) Previous work by the applicant has shown how turbulent vorticity transport (between the contrarotating vortices that form in a jet or plume in a crossflow) directly results in the decay of circulation, mostly occurring on the centre plane. That analysis approximated temporal rates of circulation decay using the streamwise spatial derivative of circulation and the crossflow velocity. In the proposed research a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent jet in a crossflow will be carried out, giving direct assessment of temporal rates of change of circulation, thereby providing validation and extension of the previously established model. (2) Previous studies by the applicant on single and twin jets, issuing from ground plane circular nozzles, show that penetration is enhanced for in-line jets and reduced when they are side-by-side, when compared to a single jet. Other work, on buoyant plumes issuing from stacks, does not show exactly the same trends. The proposed research will examine the differences in near field behaviour of jets/plumes issuing from ground plane nozzles compared to those from stacks, providing design information concerning the optimum source configurations for enhancing penetration and an explanation of the near-field effects on those processes. (3) For engineering applications thunderstorm downbursts (more frequent than tornados in Canada) are modelled using a circular momentum jet that impinges upon a ground plane. The applicant's collaboration with a US meteorologist has preovided a CFD model for a more realistic, density driven, downburst. The proposed research will extend this model by examining the interaction of two or more events in close proximity (since this often occurs in thunderstorms), with validation provided by experiments using the release of dense fluid packets into a larger reservoir. The work will be of use in assessing the effects of multiple downbursts on long structures, such as transmission lines, and will also aid the development of risk models for such events.

Suppose you are given a bag containing blue and yellow beads and are asked the following  questions: How many different necklaces can you make with exactly 5 blue beads and 5 yellow beads?  For this problem observe that the necklace ""bbbbbyyyyy""  is the same as ""bbyyyyybbb"" when the beads are rotated by 3 positions.  Thus, when you attempt to produce a list of such necklaces, it is not a trivial task to ensure that there are no duplicates.



This is an example of a problem encounted in the field of ""Combinatorial Generation"" which is a branch of theoretical computer science.  In this area, the primary research goal is to develop fast computer algorithms to automatically produce exhaustive lists of fundamental mathematical objects - with no duplication.  These objects, such as permutations, combinations, necklaces, and vertex orderings of graphs are often used to model important scientific problems.   As an example, one of the most famous of such algorithms is the Binary Reflected Gray Code.  This algorithm lists all binary numbers of length N so that each successive bit-string differs by exactly one bit from the previous bit-string.   This algorithm was patented and used in pulse code communications.



The primary goal of my research is to continue to develop efficient algorithms to produce exhaustive lists for specific objects.  When developing such algorithms, intense study of each object is required, and this often leads to new insights about the object itself.  The algorithms also enhance a toolbox of results that will be crucial for future researchers.

"The number of legally blind Americans exceeds 1 million with around 10% of them having no perception of light whatsoever. This project is intended to answer the fundamental questions of creating vision for blinds using direct electrical stimulation for large scale visual prostheses. Several research groups have opted to design visual prostheses. Electrical stimulation of the retina or of the optic nerve can be used to reverse the loss of sight induced by outer retinal degeneration caused by diseases the likes of retinitis pigmentosa or even by age-related macular degeneration. These techniques, however, are not helpful for the case of diseases affecting the inner or whole thickness retina or the optic nerve, nor as well for the case of eye loss. Such diseases, nonetheless, can be reversed by using intracortical visual prostheses. Matrices of electrodes implanted in the visual cortex are used to create a visual image consisting of an array of visual perceptions, or phosphenes. The starting point of this proposed project is a well-established preliminary design which includes ASICs that have already been fabricated and tested on conventional electronic test benches. The ongoing work tackles four different and complementary facets of the problem, namely 1) Modeling, stimulation techniques and parameters, 2) implant implementation and optimization, including electrode matrices fabrication and device encapsulation, 3) an external controller, including image acquisition and processing, and 4) in-vivo implantation in chronic animal and testing. We wish to provide sets of parameters for efficient, safe and effective chronic stimulation of the cortex. As the project involves actual implantation of devices, one important objective is to define reliable surgical techniques and optimal device physical characteristics and to acquire know-how regarding miniaturization and assembly. We also aim at maximizing the exploitation of the device by using advanced acquisition and processing techniques, which involve the design and integration of image sensors, processing algorithms and hardware on efficient and low power devices.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","�cole Polytechnique de Montr�al",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Technologie biom�dicale","G�nie biom�dical"
"Today, numerous severe and spread afflictions that remain not thoroughly understood are related to the central nervous system. Indeed, the complexity of the phenomena involved and the small scale of the afflicted areas, combined with a lack of dedicated tools, hinder investigations. Getting biological insight in situ of tissues and studying neurodynamics require to monitor and control physical and chemical activity at the cellular level. Our research program consists in building dense implantable electrochemical sensing microsystems intended for distributed monitoring and regulation of cortical neurodynamics. The envisioned devices will enable performing simultaneous electrochemical measurements from several sites in numerous areas of the cortex. These neuroengineering capabilities promise to enable multidisciplinary studies and should prompt investigations for new advanced rehabilitation approaches and diagnostic tools. We expect that these capabilities will enable gaining more knowledge and will bring new avenues to tackle neural diseases such as blindness, epilepsy and Parkinson. To do so, we plan to build wireless devices capable of interactions (sensing/actuating) with neural structures and fluids, and aim to build high data rate biotelemetry systems allowing for operation of several devices in ad hoc networks. Increasing implants reliability for long-term and safe operation is also among our goals.

"High channel count sensor and actuator devices are needed to tackle bulky wiring bundles introduced by the

growing number of functions in aircrafts. In new avionic systems, communications between devices across

different application domains are needed, which drastically increases information flow within the aircraft.

Wiring bundles and demand for a much higher communication bandwidth raise serious challenges requiring the

development of new avionic data buses, smart sensors, and network interfaces.

In responding to these technological challenges, this project aims at developing a new avionic communication

network allowing a reduction of the complexity of cabling by adopting a lower wire-count solution, using

state-of-the-art avionic data network technologies. Digital interfaces will be developed to connect legacy

position sensors and actuators to data buses. Emerging Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and photonic

technologies will be employed to develop new lightweight, contactless, and reliable position sensor in order to

provide enhanced performance while reducing the cost of deployment and maintenance. A multi-protocol/

multi-rate architecture based on Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) is chosen as the baseline

network architecture, which would achieve a solution for avionics data networks combining throughput,

architecture adaptability, and secure and safe digital data stream with reliable time determinism, bounded

latency, guaranteed bandwidth, and fault tolerance suitable for safety-critical applications. This project will also

address issues related to frequency selection and the effect of EMC and EMI for the development of

safety-critical wireless communication systems of the future.

As we recognize the imperative to develop new avionics technologies and to contribute to the effort of the

industrial partners to enhance their world-wide technological leading position and market competitiveness, it

can be expected that the successful completion of this project will not only provide a significant technological

contribution, but also showcase the capabilities of Canadian industry and universities in the related sectors.",Aerospace,"�cole Polytechnique de Montr�al","1 & 2","CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Dispositifs �lectroniques","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"

"The objective of this proposal is to understand and reduce the vibrations and that occur  during propulsion 

which cause pain/spasms in manual wheelchair users. We plan to study three aspects of wheelchair vibration 

over the next 5 years. 

In the first goal, we will work at exploring what areas on the wheelchair contribute to dampen vibration. More individuals are using rigid frame designed wheelchairs made from titanium or aluminium that are developed to be lighter, more durable and more efficient. The rigid frame versus the folding frame allows for more of the propulsion effort from the wheelchair user to be transmitted to the wheel and forward movement. IF there is vibration within this system, then this design, too, may transmit vibration more easily through the chair at a 

different frequency than with a folding frame. Using accelerometers mounted to the frame and foot rest and 

bite bar, we can measure the different effects wheelchair design has on vibration transmission. 



In the second goal we will explore the relationship between vibration during wheelchair propulsion and the 

muscle response in spinal cord injured subjects who experience spasms. Using electromyography techniques 

we will measure the neuromuscular response during various vibration frequencies and magnitudes recording 

what type of vibration elicits the greatest response as well as record what the individual is subjectively 

experience for pain. This will then give us an idea of what vibration frequency need to be dampened. 



Our third goal is to break down each component of the wheelchair to examine at what level vibration 

dampening is possible without compromising the integrity of the wheelchair frame. Knowing what vibration 

levels are most challenging for the individuals with SCI, we can develop dampening systems to target that 

range.

"Strongly correlated electron systems exhibit some of the most interesting physical properties for possible future applications in electronic devices, sustainable energy, biomedical devices, transportation and perhaps even quantum computing. Materials made of transition metal and rare earth compounds such as the oxides are examples often exhibiting extreme properties such as high temperature superconductivity, high thermoelectric power, high dielectric constants, collassal magneto resistance and many more. These materials are different from conventional semiconductors like Si or simple metals like Al in which the charge of the electrons moving in amongst atoms plays the important role in determining the applications. Transition metal oxides on the other hand often are electrical insulators and magnetic because of the strong repulsive interaction between the electrons. However chemical substitution can turn such magnetic insulators into high temperature superconductors ( Nobel Prize 1988 ) and cause other dramatic changes in their properties. The basic physics governing their behaviour remains one of the biggest intellectual challenges of modern scientific research. Here the spin and orbital degrees of freedom and their interplay with the charge degrees of freedom of electrons play essential roles. New experimental methods are needed which are sensitive to these degrees of freedom and applicable to nanometer scale structures such as in thin films, interfaces and heterostructures. 

Our research, based on strong international collaborations, is aimed at the preparation and study of new oxides and heterostructures thereof using an atom by atom build up approach with Molecular beam epitaxy methods. We are developing new x ray and synchrotron based experimental techniques including a large project at the Canadian light source to be able to study the charge, spin, and orbital structure of such systems with high spatial resolution. Thirdly we are developing a theoretical understanding of these experimental methods and are providing a theoretical guidance for the most interesting systems to study.

"Over the last few years advances in observational technology and technique have made it possible to reach back in time and observe directly galaxies at high redshift, z>2 - i.e., at a time when galaxies were young. However, primarily for reasons of observational economy, most of the detailed studies of distant galaxies have focused on relatively luminous objects.  We currently know very little about faint galaxies that in fact form the bulk of the population by sheer number and that indeed are responsible for forming most of the majority of stars and heavy chemical elements in the distant universe.  This program will address this deficiency in our knowledge.  



Over the next several years I will lead a program that will aim to understand the nature of distant star-forming galaxies by comparing faint and luminous high-redshift objects against each other. We will use existing as well as new data (to be acquired with space and ground-based telescopes) to measure the masses, ages, and other properties of very faint galaxies in the early, distant universe.  Then, by comparing faint against luminous galaxies located at the same epoch, we will be able to understand what makes them different from each other. Understanding these differences will give us important new insights into how galaxies in the distant universe form and evolve.

"Biogas is a renewable source of energy comprised mainly of methane and CO2, in addition to some impurities such as H2S and water vapour. Development of the biogas industry is growing worldwide at a fast rate. Upgrading biogas into a higher quality source of energy for heating, power generation, vehicle fuel and grid injection, may be achieved using different technologies such as adsorption, chemical absorption, water scrubbing and membrane separation. These methods afford biomethane with 90-99 % purity and different yields. All current biogas upgrading technologies are multi-stage, cumbersome processes. A common feature of these processes is the use of a separate H2S removal unit. 

At the University of Ottawa (UO), Sayari and co-workers developed a family of carbon dioxide adsorbents with unprecedented attributes and patents have been filed on this discovery. The UO's adsorbents exhibit high adsorption capacity for CO2, unparalleled high selectivity toward CO2 versus N2 and O2, excellent regeneration ability, very high rate of adsorption. They are also recyclable and moisture-tolerant, providing significant advantages in comparison to other CO2 adsorbents such as zeolites and activated carbons. 

Recent findings showed that the UO's adsorbents also exhibit infinitely high selectivity toward CO2 versus methane. Thus, the idea of developing a unique biogas upgrading technology based on a single-stage process with simultaneous/sequential removal of CO2, H2S and water vapour was born. 

The objective of this project is to build a dedicated setup for measurements of H2S uptake. The facility will be comprised of a TGA instrument and a H2S selective gas analyzer. This acquisition will play a critical role toward the development of a novel Canadian technology in clean and renewable energy that could be commercialized worldwide. It will also allow us to strengthen our leading role in adsorption/separation. It will be exclusively used by young research researchers as part of their multidisciplinary training.

"Closed circuit anesthesia delivery systems are a common sight in any operating room nowadays. These devices make possible the reuse of expensive anesthetics by the recirculation of breathing gases after the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) exhaled by the patient. The technology currently used for CO2 separation is based on a solid absorbent called soda lime that presents various shortcomings like potential to degrade anesthetics into toxic compounds and a CO2 removal capacity that is negatively affected by moisture. The objective of this research project is to develop a novel, safer approach for the removal of CO2 in anesthesia delivery systems. A new material, called TR1-PE-MCM-41, was developed by Sayari and co-workers at the University of Ottawa (UO) specifically for the separation of CO2 and has promising characteristics as a replacement of soda lime. This material does not react with the anesthetics, is tolerant to moisture and, unlike the current technology, has the potential of being reused over several cycles. The performance of this new material for anesthesia delivery applications will be investigated by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in materials science and engineering (Sayari's group, UO Faculty of Science), medical device development (Mussivand's group UO Heart Institute) and clinical anesthesia (Robblee's group, UO Heart Institute). The results of this project will represent a key step toward the commercialization of this technology in the medical field and in other closed circuit breathing system applications.","Medical equipment and apparatus","University of Ottawa",2,"CHRPJ ","Collaborative Health Research Projects","Science et technologie des mat�riaux","Science et technologie des mat�riaux"
"Periodic mesoporous materials (PMMs) are prepared using surfactants and polymers as supramolecular templates. They exhibit high surface area, and exquisitely ordered pore structure with adjustable sizes from 2 to ca. 10 nm in diameter. Since the discovery of the first periodic mesoporous silicas in early nineties, our group made significant contributions to the development of this field. One of our most important achievements was the discovery of an innovative method to expand in a controlled manner the pore size and volume of mesoporous silica from typically 3.5 nm and 0.8 cm3/g up to unprecedented 25 nm and 3.6 cm3/g without loss of surface area (> 1000 m2/g). One of the major thrusts of the proposed research is the rational design of mesoporous (more generally nanostructured) materials, their preparation, characterization and applications in such areas as catalysis, separation and chemical sensing. 



The key objective is to develop

 

1. novel strategies for the preparation and modification of functional PMMs. This will include framework modification by transition metals and organic species as well as surface functionalization via direct coprecipitation and by post-synthesis procedures.

 

2. applications in environmental protection (e.g., wastewater and air cleaning), catalysis (e.g., environmental, light hydrocarbon activation, biofuels, synthesis of high value added fine chemicals), separation (e.g., selective adsorption of CO2 and other acid gases; H2 purification and O2 enrichment for fuel cells applications) and advanced materials (e.g., sensors, polymer-silica nanocomposites).

"The concepts of physical organic chemistry and photochemistry are applied to the study of nanomaterials and to the controlled release of specific properties.

In the case of metallic nanomaterials we work on gold, silver, copper and cobalt, as well as alloys, and have devised new efficient, green and fast ways of making nanoparticles in a carefully controlled way.  These nanoparticles have long term stability, are largely unprotected, and can readily be modified for applications in sensors, in biology or for catalysis.  Other nanopaticles of interest include semiconductors, frequently referred as quantum dots, that have very special luminescent properties; for example the colour of emission can be readily tuned by adjusting the particle size. In the case of CdSe quantum dots their emission falls in the visible region.  We have examined their interaction with free radicals, in particular nitroxides and in the process developed a sensor for free radicals.

The controlled release of properties includes a wide range of materials; for example in the case of photocages, we aim at developing a material capable of releasing antiviral drugs for use in eye therapies, in particular in relation to corneal transplants. In another example we release antioxidant activity in a thermally activated process. Several other examples deal with fluorescence sensors, where emission is used to report on DNA properties or for ion detection.

"Two decades ago we pioneered the study of sequential two-photon processes, described as the photochemistry of reaction intermediates. We reviewed the topic in 1988. At the time we frequently talked about two-laser two-color photochemistry, since the laser used to make an intermediate was usually of a different wavelength than that used to irradiate it, frequently leading to products that could not be obtained with a single laser or with a lamp. We usually regarded the -sometimes unavoidable- occurrence of multiphoton processes taking place within a single high-energy laser pulse as a problem.

On other projects, we worked on the development of new photoacid generators (PAG) for use in resists for microlithography.  We also developed methods to measure acid generation in situ, or more accurately on wafer; these are now well established and widely used in industry. Much of this work was performed at a time when the features in computer chips were larger than the excitation wavelength employed in lithographic imaging. Little did we know that these two areas would 'blend' in the current decade to become the perceived solution to overcome physical limits to increase spatial resolution in tomorrow's computer chips.

When Gordon Moore predicted in 1965 that the number of transistors per chip would double every 2 years, the preferred lithographic wavelength was 365 nm and typical features were 10-20 micron.  That is, the feature was forty times larger than the wavelength of light that generated it.  Moore's law has been followed for about 40 years but is approaching a physics barrier.  Today 193 nm laser light is used and the usually quoted resolution limit is ~ 64 nm.  Industry has already improved on 64 nm by using double exposure and immersion lithography.  They aim at 35 nm features by 2009 and 22 nm shortly after, well below the usually quoted one half or one third of the wavelength. This project aims at obtaining spatial resolution as small as one ninth of the wavelength using two-photon techniques, and to use the new chemistry as a platform from which to explore the next generation lithography, widely expected to involve extreme UV light, essentially a form of soft x-rays.

"Enzymes are highly evolved proteins, exquisitely designed by nature for specific purposes.  By fully understanding their mechanism of action and structure, we can exploit them as efficient biosynthetic tools, modulate biochemical pathways to obtain desired end-products, or develop inhibitor that can control activity-associated disease states.  Two different enzymes from two yeasts will be investigated.  Processing glucosidase I (Glu I) is critical to cell function in higher eukaryotes and has potential as a therapeutic target for anti-viral , anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer drugs. Tyrosine/phenylalanine ammonia lyases (T/PAL) are enzymes with a wide range of specificty towards phenylalanine or tyrosine.  The basis for this specificity is not understood.  Activity with tyrosine is highly desirable, as the product, p-coumaric acid, has a high industrial demand.  A better understanding of the mechanism and structure of Glu I  and T/PAL is necessary to control or use these enzymes in health and commercial applications. In terms of basic research, both of these enzymes pose intriguing questions related to enzyme structure, function, and mechanism.  This project will carry out the following: (1) site directed mutagenesis of potential key amino acid residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis , followed by kinetic and structural evaluation of the mutants; (2) examining the functional domain structure of the enzymes by cloning and expression of truncated gene products; (3) crystallographic studies to further our understanding of the enzyme structure/function.  These experiments will clarify key aspects of the structure and mechanism of Glu I and T/PAL, and will allow us to exploit them through rational inhibitor synthesis (Glu I) and by designing enzymes to efficiently produce industrially important p-coumaric acid (T/PAL).

"Accurate and precise measurement of the physical properties of food materials is critical for good prediction of the performance of ingredients subject to specified food processing conditions.  Density is an important physical property that governs the functionality of many food materials, especially proteins.  These funds will be used to purchase a very high precision density meter that will be primarily used to acquire better thermodynamic data on the properties of food proteins and the nature of the interactions of proteins with small molecules in food systems.  Flavour compounds are examples of small molecules that bind to proteins, and in doing so the taste of the food product is altered.  By combining data acquired on the density meter with other high precision data acquired on protein properties, such as heat capacity and adiabatic compressibility, we will gain novel insights into how proteins behave and how we can use this knowledge to control protein functionality in a variety of foods.

"Processed foods are wonderfully complex materials where the microstructures created during the various heat, mass and momentum transfer events of food process operations determine the properties of the food.  Unravelling this complexity is the key to accurately predicting the quality of novel and conventional foods, and to developing successful nutrient loading strategies for the creation of healthy functional foods.  The research of this Discovery grant is focused on studying two important food materials and characterizing their elastic and time-dependent behaviour.  Computational techniques will be used to cope with the complexity that time-dependent behaviour adds to analyses of the indentation process of these materials.  [Indentation is a technique where a probe is inserted into the surface of a material and the mechanical behaviour of the material is assessed through measurement of force on the probe as it is displaced into the material.  It is an ideal method for examining the fragile structures of soft materials such as foods because it circumvents potentially destructive sample preparation procedures, yet it can be used to determine fundamental mechanical properties.]  By understanding how to back-extract fundamental mechanical properties from indentation tests, the research will enable indentation to be developed as a simple rapid tool for evaluations of the mechanical properties of biological materials.  In addition, a systematic evaluation of the mechanical behaviour of two important classes of food materials possessing a network structure can potentially uncover novel physical phenomena, and so lead to the development of new biological constitutive models.  Insights gained from these models on how food quality can be optimized during processing will allow processors to formulate healthier foods that retain the quality attributes of conventional foods, and thereby reduce the incidence of diet-related disease in Canada.",Agriculture,"University of Manitoba",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Transformation, conditionnement, conservation et stockage des aliments","Science et technologie de l'alimentation"

"This project focuses on natural trace gases produced by marine algae and bacteria which affect atmospheric chemistry and climate. The production of these gases in Canadian waters will be affected by global climate change, since global warming is already altering patterns of marine productivity and sea-ice cover, both of which are important controlling factors in the process of sea-to-air gas exchange.

Dimethylsulfide (DMS) is a marine biogenic gas and the main natural source of sulfur to the atmosphere. DMS is produced in the sea by the enzymatic transformation of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), an osmolyte and anti-oxidant compound found in various species of phytoplankton. Production of DMSP (and hence DMS) is closely linked to marine productivity, with richer, more productive regions typically being larger sources of DMS. Once it escapes into the air, DMS influences atmospheric chemistry, photochemistry and climate via the formation of sulfate aerosols, which are critical to the production of cloud condensation nuclei - microscopic dust particles which control the formation of clouds. Thus, DMS is a very important link between the biosphere and the earth's climate. Scientists wish to understand more about the production of DMS in the sea in order to improve our ability to predict the earth's climate system, particularly under global-warming scenarios.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the third most important natural greenhouse gas, after carbon dioxide and methane. N2O is produced primarily by microbial activity, since it is an important component in the natural cycling of nitrogen. About 35% of the total global natural source of N2O comes from the ocean. In recent decades, increased amounts of ammonia and nitrate (from fertilizer runoff), plus the feedback effects of global warming, have increased global N2O production, and may have a measurable effect on climate. Greater knowledge of N2O distribution and production in ocean waters is needed to better understand this important link between the atmosphere and biosphere.

"The research tools and instruments requested in this proposal will be used to make measurements for acoustic analyses and to verify computer models in the Computational Acoustic Modeling Laboratory (CAML) in the Schulich School of Music of McGill University.  The overall goal of this research is to use novel measurement, digital signal processing, and computer-based modeling techniques to improve our understanding of the acoustical, fluid-dynamic, and mechanical principles governing music instruments.  Scientific methods and tools will be developed in the course of this research program to: 1. assess the perceptually important features of high-quality instruments; 2. suggest possible improvements or simplifications to instrument designs; 3. improve virtual sound synthesis; and 4. aid in music pedagogy.  The focus here is largely on music instruments, though these results will also have a wide range of potential technological, multimedia, and acoustical engineering applications. 



This equipment will support the training of highly qualified personnel, providing valuable experience with state-of-the-art measurement systems. Results of this work will improve current efforts in the design / analysis / evaluation of music instruments.  For example, we are working to develop tools that allow music instrument manufacturers to quickly test and experiment with design changes to help improve instrument characteristics such as response and intonation.  Other current or intended applications of this research include physics-based algorithms for sound synthesizers that simulate the complex acoustic phenomena of real instruments and respond to player gestures in more natural, intuitive ways and systems to inform teachers and students about proper or more efficient ways of playing their instruments.  Finally, some of these results are expected to have direct application in commercial acoustical engineering contexts, such as methods to predict aeroacoustic sounds in ventilation, exhaust, or wind turbine systems.

"Habitat selection may be the most studied feature of animal ecology; it also represents information crucial to the recovery of species declining due to habitat loss.  Conclusions about habitat selection, however, are often sensitive to the scale -- the extent or resolution of our observations in space and time.  Scale represents an impediment to drawing general conclusions across different study areas, populations, or species.  This research will combine modelling and field studies of the habitat selection of northern mammals with two broad goals: (1) to develop and test a new ""geostatistical model"", a tool for revealing the scales at which animals respond to their environment and (2) to determine the habitat factors that affect imperiled caribou populations.  Deleterious changes to caribou habitat are hypothesized to be caused by logging in the boreal forest (for threatened woodland caribou) and severe snow conditions in the High Arctic (for endangered Peary caribou).



The geostatistical model will be developed using artificial data, then tested using field observations of mammals ranging in size from flying squirrels to black bears.  The intent is to develop greater predictive power of how animals perceive and respond to their surroundings.  Such information is crucial to assessing the impact of landscape changes on wildlife.



The habitat investigations of caribou will take place in southeastern Manitoba and Axel Heiberg Island in Nunavut.  At both these study locations, we will search for consistency in the habitat selection by caribou across scales, an indicator of critical habitat factors.  Understanding these mechanisms is crucial to halting the decline of these imperiled populations.

"For over 25 years, I have been working on applying heuristic search and knowledge techniques towards building high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) systems. I often use game-playing and puzzle-solving programs as my experimental test domains. This has led to success in numerous domains (chess, checkers, poker, sliding tile puzzles, Rubik's Cube - all yielding valuable insights). However, each program is ""one of a kind"", with limited carryover from domain to domain. Although some of the algorithms apply to classes of applications, each high-performance AI system represents a complete re-implementation.

   Humans are very good at transferring their experience in one domain (a game/puzzle in this case) to another. The state of the art in computing science is that the program designer transfers their experience from building a program for one domain to that of building a program for another domain. Ideally, the human should be factored out of this process.

   There has been movement in the AI community to build general systems that can handle a broad class of applications. In this particular case, can we build a program capable of taking any game and, based solely on the rules and past experience, build a new game-playing program? Such a program would be a step towards the realization of ""human level"" AI. 

   This project will investigate the research issues around building a high-performance (high level of demonstrated skill) general game-playing program. The intent is to have a program that is a) capable of learning to play a broad spectrum of games and b) is scalable in its ability to learn (more learning time equates to better performance).

"Catalytic methods afford energy efficient routes for the synthesis of complex molecules. Amines are critical building blocks for the assembly of a broad range of target compounds including alkaloid natural products, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Often the required amine building blocks are chiral, meaning they have non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), and these enantiomers can have different properties when reacted with targeted biological receptors in human health treatments. Thus, the selective synthesis of enantiomeric amines and N-containing cyclic compounds (N-heterocycles) is an important aspect of daily production for the pharmaceutical industry. New methods to achieve the efficient syntheses of these small molecule building blocks can result in reduced waste production and cost savings during manufacture. The Schafer group has recently discovered a new family of catalysts for the efficient synthesis of chiral amines from simple amines and alkene feedstocks, in a 100% atom-economic reaction (there are no by-products in this reaction). This new reaction, the alpha-alkylation of amines, assembles the desired chiral amine products in only one step, with no by-products, by using a synthetic strategy that is complementary to traditional step-wise routes. A focused effort to realize the full potential of this new synthetic transformation and to extend academic achievements to small molecules of relevance to the pharmaceutical industry is supported by Boehringer Ingelheim Canada Ltd. This collaboration will exploit this emerging technology in the competitive manufacturing of required amine small molecules for the pharmaceutical industry. Using this catalytic

approach, traditional multi-step syntheses can be reduced to one atom-economic, catalytic step. The newly developed catalysts take advantage of the low toxicity of tantalum, a metal frequently used in medical implants. Thus, this proposal also addresses green manufacturing approaches for the environmentally friendly synthesis of these critical building blocks for application in the pharmaceutical industry.","Manufacturing processes and products","University of British Columbia",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","M�thodologie en synth�se","Chimie organique"

"Catalytic methods afford energy efficient routes for the synthesis of complex molecules. Recent developments from a pharmaceutical company in Vancouver, British Columbia, Neuromed, have shown that a family of nitrogen containing cyclic compounds, piperazines, can be used for a novel approach toward the treatment of chronic pain. Chronic pain affects the lives of millions of Canadians and costs the country billions in reduced productivity and increased medical costs. Consequently, new orally available treatments that avoid addictive and sedative side-effects that are common with drugs such as Morphine, are highly sought after. This proposal addresses an alternative, catalytic synthetic approach for the rapid and facile synthesis of this class of piperazine products. The catalysts to be employed for this reaction build carbon-nitrogen bonds with no by-products and are a new class of catalysts that take advantage of the low cost and low toxicity of zirconium metal. The proposed synthetic strategy reduces the number of synthetic steps, which in turn reduces waste-streams while accessing a broad range of piperazines which may display desirable biological activity. Neuromed pharmaceuticals will be involved in screening catalytically prepared compounds for favourable activity. Overall, the impact of this new synthetic approach will improve manufacturing efficiency and flexbility to enhance productivity while reducing energy consumption and environmental impacts in the synthesis of this important class of compounds.","Human pharmaceuticals","University of British Columbia",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Catalyse,"Chimie inorganique"
"Early transition metals, such as titanium and zirconium, and lanthanide metals have been used successfully for metal-mediated organic synthesis.  As catalysts, these metals are able to promote reactions that normally cannot occur.  Catalysis is very important for industrial applications, as it promotes chemical tranformations in a cost effective, energy efficient manner while minimizing chemical waste.  Certainly catalysis is key to the development of environmentally friendly green chemistry and sustainable methods for chemical production.  Early transition and lanthanide metals are particularly attractive for large scale applications, due to the fact that they are of low cost and low toxicity.  The easily prepared, inexpensive catalytic complexes developed in our research group show promise for a broad range of important catalytic transformations in the pharmaceutical, polymer and fine chemical industries.

  

Using the class of metals presented above, we have developed a family of complexes (amidate complexes) that display unprecedented and highly desirable catalytic activity in selective C-N bond formation for intramolecular reactions (both reactive partners are contained in one starting material).  We propose to continue our exploration of these complexes for C-N bond formation, to achieve a long-standing goal in chemical synthesis, the addition of amines (N-H bonds) to simple alkenes (C=C bonds) in an intermolecular fashion (reactive partners are two separate molecules).    

In addition to selective C-N bond formation we will be exploring the potential application of this new family of complexes in C-C coupling reactions, as well as polymerization reactions.  Recent results demonstrate the usefulness of these complexes in the catalytic preparation of biodegradable, compostable polymers. 

 

The funds requested will support our on-going efforts to fully explore and develop these new catalytic systems.

"The central goal of community ecology is to explain the substantial degree to which natural communities vary in composition.  Plant communities, for example, vary in the number of species they host, how community resources are divided among resident species, and in the morphology of constituent species.  While considerable effort has gone into understanding the mechanisms that drive this variation, many questions are still unresolved, and many competing theories are still vigorously debated.  For example, it is clear that competition plays an important role in plant communities; however, current models of competition suggest that competition will result in the exclusion of all but the most competitive species.  Given that virtually all natural communities contain more than one species, it stands to reason that either the impact of competition is mitigated by other processes that promote diversity, such as dispersal, or that the competitive process is more complicated than we know, and tends not to result in the loss of all but the most competitive species.  My students and I will examine these possibilities by developing more realistic models of multi-species competition, testing these models with manipulative field experiments, and by using null modeling techniques to identify and quantify the impacts of competition, dispersal, and herbivory in natural communities spanning important environmental gradients.  This work will contribute to the growing body of literature concerning how these important mechanisms interact to  shape natural communities.  Additionally, understanding the relative impact of different mechanisms that may augment (e.g., dispersal), or reduce diversity (e.g., competition) will greatly inform conservation and restoration initiatives, and aid in the management of invasive species.

"Transition metal catalysis is of extreme importance in chemical industry and production: 70%-80% of all chemical processes are performed under catalytic conditions, most of them involving transition metals... and this percentage is rising. The challenge of more environmentally conscious chemical production, ""green chemistry"", also furthers the interest in catalytic reactions. They require in general less energy, are more selective, more efficient and produce thus less waste. Our group is interested in new methodologies for transition metal assisted transformations, spanning the range from catalytic reactions for pharmaceutical applications to mass market polymerizations of oil-derived monomers. 



The number of ""chiral"" drugs, which contain only one of two possible enantiomers, is consistently rising. Since enantiomers have the same physical properties and cannot be separated by any physical means, the synthesis of enantiopure compounds relies on the use of chiral starting materials or auxiliaries. Since the only source of these chiral materials is nature (""chiral pool""), they are of relatively low availability and high-priced. A different approach is taken by enantioselective catalysis, where reactions are performed using a chiral catalyst. In this case the chiral information of the catalyst is multiplied, since each catalyst molecule participates in the formation of several (up to several thousands) of product molecules. 



In this project we will investigate new chiral ligands, available from simple starting materials, for copper-catalyzed organic transformations. Increasing the efficiency of chiral catalysis and thus the purity of the obtained products eliminates subsequent separations and waste of starting materials, which will reduce the high price of enantiopure chemicals, particularly important in pharmaceutical industry.

"Since the first recombinant product in 1982, the biopharma industry has experienced an unprecedented growth in Canada with sales approaching $10billion annually. The conventional platforms expressing many biopharmaceuticals (animal cell lines and Escherichia coli) have some drawbacks. To alleviate these, the engineering assessment and optimization of fed-batch cultures of two alternate, emerging recombinant hosts, namely Pichia pastoris (a eukaryote) and Streptomyces lividans (a prokaryote) expressing human interleukin-3 (huIl-3) are proposed as model systems for study. The proposed research is built upon the applicant's experience with recombinant protein bioprocesses. The objective is to develop a model-based optimization strategy for manipulating the nutrient feed and operating conditions in order to maximize the recombinant protein productivity and the concentration. A structured experimental approach and data analysis will be required to fully optimize the process. As a first step a stoichiometry-based metabolic flux model will be constructed to detail catabolic pathways, biosynthesis, and gene regulation.  The full flux model will be simplified and fine-tuned by statistical methods. Potential bottlenecks affecting optimum expression will be identified. The metabolic flux model will be applied, in turn, to establish a balanced medium to reduce metabolic stress that may lead to product degradation.. Control routines will be developed and optimized so as to produce robust process trajectories in batch and fed-batch culture. An important aspect of the experimental work is to identify probable mass transfer limitations in high density culture and apply corrective measures if necessary. The resulting data will then be used as the basis for optimization of the bioprocesses using both in situ and ex-situ instrumentation.

Primary objectives of his research are to 1) investigate biological and environmental factors that govern these shifts, 2) assess the ecological impact of invasive species on ecosystem structure and dynamics, and 3) develop predictive mathematical models that aid in conserving natural resources and native biodiversity. Metaxas' research evaluates factors that regulate population dynamics of bottom-dwelling invertebrates, particularly the supply of planktonic larvae and recruitment of new individuals. Primary objectives of her research are to measure effects of physical and biological habitat characteristics on 1) larval behaviour, 2) spatial and temporal patterns of larval abundance, settlement and recruitment of invasive species, 3) interactions between early life history stages of native and invasive species, and 4) larval dispersal and connections among spatially distinct populations. We request funds to purchase a 4WD truck with the capability to 1) trailer our 7.2 m, 4 t research vessel throughout the year to various field sites separated by 100s of km; 2) launch and retrieve this vessel on steeply graded slipways or rough terrain; 3) provide secure and reliable transport for 5 field personnel, sensitive and expensive oceanographic equipment, and marine organisms. Leasing or renting a vehicle is not possible since diving safety regulations require that we secure scuba tanks (we carry up to 18 tanks at a time) in a metal box mounted to the frame. This requires structural modification of the vehicle and coating the inner floor panel to protect against seawater corrosion. Because our research is field based and involves diving from our boat or from shore, a vehicle is our most fundamental and essential item of research equipment.","Oceans, seas and estuaries","Dalhousie University",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","�cologie aquatique et limnologie","�volution et �cologie"
"As ecologists and students of the ocean, we have become increasingly aware that coastal ecosystems have been profoundly altered, relative to their naturally evolved state, by the activity of humans. Among the most urgent concerns is the introduction of new species into marine communities, that then expand rapidly to replace native species. These human-mediated biological invasions can result in pronounced changes in habitat and ecosystem structure and function, often with dire ecologic and economic consequences. The community of seaweeds, invertebrates and fish that inhabit the rocky seabed of Atlantic Canada provides a striking example of a heavily impacted ecosystem. Historically, this community has alternated between two ecological states dependent on the abundance of a key herbivore, the sea urchin: kelp beds where urchins are rare and barrens where urchins dominate the seascape and seaweeds are absent. Cyclical alternations between these states are driven by sporadic outbreaks of a disease that kills urchins. Amid this backdrop of perturbation and instability, synergistic interactions between recently introduced species have shifted the ecosystem towards a novel community state dominated by an invasive Asian seaweed. The objective of our research is to understand the biological and environmental processes that regulate transitions between ecosystem states or determine their persistence. In particular, we will investigate the effects of invasive species on ecosystem structure and function using a range of experimental and observational approaches to examine species interactions, construct food webs, and develop predictive mathematical models that are needed for intelligent management of this increasingly perturbed ecosystem.

"The goals of the proposed research are to examine (1) how music lessons affect cognitive development, and (2) how music cognition changes over development. The first series of studies will examine how training in music is associated with cognitive development. We know that music lessons are predictive of small but very general increases in intellectual ability. The association appears to be causal, with longer duration of lessons predicting larger benefits. Such associations are evident whether the outcome measures involve verbal, mathematical, or spatial abilities. They are also evident across the various subtests and indexes that comprise standardized IQ tests. These findings do not exclude the possibility, however, that music lessons affect some underlying processing mechanisms (e.g., executive functioning, working memory) more than others, and that these mechanisms have broad effects on intellectual functioning. To examine this hypothesis, children and adults will be tested with correlational methods to document pre-existing associations. A separate longitudinal experiment with children will allow for inferences of causation. Testing will involve a battery of cognitive and perceptual tests to determine whether performance on one or more tests varies as a function of musical training.



Music is a particularly interesting domain of study for cognitive scientists because a musical tune is defined by relational information. As such, listeners can recognize a familiar tune whether it is played quickly at a high pitch, or slowly at a low pitch. But listeners also remember fine-grained absolute information about musical timbre (sound quality), pitch, and tempo. Another series of experiments will examine children's and adults' mental representations of melodies and short tone sequences. The overarching goal is to examine how sensitivity to absolute and relative features of music changes over development. Other goals are to determine how different absolute features interact, how different relative features interact, and how absolute features interact with relative features.

"In my lab, we are interested in understanding what changes in the brain are associated with the learning and memory deficits found in individuals with diseases such as schizophrenia or Alzheimer's dementia. We use animals, i.e., rats and mice, to study these disease processes. Rather than using pictures and words to learn about the world they use odour cues. Nonetheless, they are as good at remembering odours as we are at remembering images.  Moreover, the parts of their brains that are associated with the processing of information are comparable to those of humans. We use ""designer"" rats and mice in our studies. These are animals that have been genetically or pharmacologically modified to have brains that model those of humans with schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. We have already shown that some strains of mice are able to remember information better than others and that most mice remember how to solve the same simple task at least nine months after they first learned it. We are currently assessing the ability of male and female mice of different strains and ages to learn more difficult memory problems. Ultimately, the results of this work may be used to help overcome the cognitive problems encountered by humans with these disorders as well as provide a better understanding of how the brain works.

"Genomic selection involves a dense marker map of the genome and the application of a statistical model to simultaneously estimate the effects of every marker or interval between markers. The sequencing of the bovine genome has resulted in the detection of many thousands of genetic markers. Recently, methods have been developed to predict total genetic value of animals using whole-genome dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker maps. Selection based on these predicted genomic values is expected to have an enormous impact on breeding programs, but further development is needed to successfully apply this technology to livestock. The estimates of the effects of every marker or interval between markers can also be used to determine the location of potential genes affecting a trait. While simulations demonstrate genomic selection has huge potential to increase rates of genetic gain, results with real data have shown lower response than the prospects. Several key questions remain regarding practical implementation and they should be further investigated, such as density of markers and data structure required for optimum estimation of the effects of markers or chromosome segments, and how the breeding programs should be altered to maximize the gains from genomic selection. This proposal will increase the knowledge about the factors that influence the accuracy of the estimation process and the implementation of genome selection, leading to optimal breeding strategies for this new technology. The overall objectives of the proposal are enhancing methods of genomic selection in dairy cattle, increasing the accuracy of predictions of genomic breeding values, and optimizing dairy cattle breeding strategies through genomic selection.","Animal production and animal primary products","University of Guelph",3,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","G�n�tique","G�n�tique"

"Genomic selection involves the use of dense marker maps of the genome and the application of statistical models to simultaneously estimate the effects of small chromosome segments linked to the markers, The estimates can be used to evaluate the genetic merit of an animal through agenomic estimated breeding value. Genomic selection methods have been developed and implemented in Canada for Holstein cattle in a collaboration effort between Canadian and American researchers. The proposal is to extend the work carried out for Holsteins by developing and implementing genomic selection in coloured dairy breeds in Canada. The proposed study includes the development of aresource population of genotyped animals for estimating marker effects. the determination of the appropriate set of marker to be used for each breed and implementation of specific methods for each breed when needed. Validation studies will be carried out to assess the gains in

reliability due to use of genomic selection in coloured breeds. The proposal will develop the foundation to implement genomic selection in the coloured breeds and will indicate the potential increase in reiiability of proofs by adopting this technology. The key feature is that animals can be genotyped for a large number of markers at birth, and these markers can provide an accurate estimate of genetic merit before the animal producing a record or any progeny. Thus generation intervals can be greatly shortened, which shall increase the possible rate of genetic change in the coloured dairy breeds in Canada.","Animal management (animal diseases, breeding)","University of Guelph","1 & 2","CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Production et reproduction animales","Biologie animale"

"When developing, designing or testing innovative ideas for new structures, it is often less expensive and more convenient  to 'build' a model instead of testing the actual structure itself.  There are basically two types of models: physical (usually built to scale) and theoretical.  Theoretical models describe the structure under consideration using the language of mathematics, that is, physical characteristics of the structure are translated into mathematics, analyzed and then translated back into real physical information.  A theoretical model can thus be used to predict and analyze the behaviour of a real physical stucture. The information obtained then allows engineers to design and develop the most efficient and cost-effective structure for a particular purpose. This procedure is particularly effective when designing and manufacturing new advanced materials used in applications ranging from biomedical to nanotechnology.



In this research, the applicant will continue to develop and extent his expertise in analytical techniques to study existing and new theoretical models, in particular, models describing the mechanical behavior of advanced materials, for example, composite materials made from different elastic (flexible) solids. In particular, the applicant will be concerned with analyzing the mechanical response of a composite to the layer used to join two or more materials together. For example, in the manufacture of a fibre-reinforced composite, the layer can be a soft (glue) layer placed between the fibre and the surrounding material. Of interest here, is the analysis of damage due to debonding, sliding or cracking between the materials and how these impact the overall mechanical properties of the composite. The results of this work will be significant in predicting the response of advanced materials manufactured in this way.

"Phenolic compounds are quality determining compounds in plant-derived foods and are widely used as functional food ingredients, owing to their supposed beneficial effects on human health. For this purpose they are extracted from various sources such as tea leaves, grape skins and seeds, apples, and even medicinal plants. Being deprived of their natural protecting matrices, the phenolics are exposed to oxygen during processing and may therefore be oxidized to instable, reactive intermediates. These so-called quinones can interact with a number of food constituents, in particular with proteins. The technological and biochemical consequences of such reactions are manifold, e.g. crosslinking of proteins, changes in enzyme activities, reduced bioavailability of both amino acids and phenolics, and modifications of the immunological properties of food proteins. While it is the primary aim of this project to characterize the products formed by the reaction of phenolic compounds and proteins using highly sophisticated analytical techniques, a better understanding of the stability of phenolic compounds and their interactions with other food constituents would allow conclusions on the optimization of processes for the production of (functional) foods and would also, to a certain extent, allow the estimation of potential adverse effects. In view of the growing importance of functional foods within the overall food market, investigations into the reactivity of their bioactive constituents are essential. Knowledge of the alterations of proteins by reaction with phenolics may also lead to the production of hypoallergenic food. Thus, it is anticipated that the results of the proposed investigations will stimulate cross-disciplinary research, in particular in the fields of food chemistry and food technology, nutritional science, toxicology, and immunology.

"Population growth in Canada is increasing the pressure on freshwater systems for two essential but diametrically opposed services: the provision of drinking water and the assimilation of wastes. In many cities, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) discharge effluent directly into rivers. WWTP effluent is the largest human impact by volume on freshwaters in Canada. We will focus on the largest Canadian watershed feeding Lake Erie, the Grand River, where several agencies and regulators require information for science-based management. The Grand River watershed is home to 950,000 people. Projected population increase is over 40% within 20 years. Currently, more than 500,000 people rely on the Grand River for drinking water while there are 26 WWTPs along the river. Non point source nutrient loads are also extremely high, as agriculture (including large livestock operations) is the dominant land use. To accommodate this new growth, billion dollar decisions for wastewater and drinking water treatment and agricultural land management have been taken. Two major wastewater treatment plants will be modified to change the form of nitrogen (N) released to the river. Further investment may be needed in the future to control phosphorous (P) load. This research project capitalizes on a unique opportunity to study the river before and after this major alteration. A comprehensive approach to understanding and modelling the P, N and oxygen (O2) cycles is planned. We will use year round field sampling, laboratory experiments and new natural isotopic techniques developed by our research group to understand the important processes of nutrient cycling and to separate agricultural from WWTP contributions to low O�2 at night and high levels of N2O, nitrate, P and ammonia in rivers.",Environment,"University of Waterloo",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","G�ochimie environnementale","G�ochimie et g�ochronologie"
"Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a critical role in aquatic systems.  DOM frequently controls light penetration, temperature, mobility and toxicity of trace metals and organic contaminants, and the  acid-base balance particularly in acid sensitive waters. DOM is also an important energy source for bacterial metabolism.  DOM in drinking water supplies increases the need for disinfection, and chlorination results in carcinogenic compounds.  Unfortunately, DOM is a complex mixture of thousands of compounds that changes spatially and temporally, even from one dip sample to the next.  Recent work has shown that  measurements of DOC (dissolved organic carbon) concentrations alone do not adequately reflect the important functions of DOM.  Measures of DOM quality are needed.  In addition, the ultimate fate of DOM governs the loss of greenhouse gases (CO2) to the atmosphere from freshwater systems.  DOM can be either converted to CO2 within the lake or stored in the lake  sediments. The partitioning of carbon between atmosphere and sediments is likely also a function of DOM quality. In the past 20 years our work on carbon cycling has focused on the production and cycling of DOM using isotopic approaches.  In parallel, we have also been developing new isotopic techniques for nitrogen cycling in forested and agricultural catchments. This proposal continues the development of innovative approaches to carbon and nitrogen cycling.  In the next phase we will specifically examine the link between DOM quality and fate in boreal systems.   We will use whole lake balances and stream studies of carbon and carbon isotopes in companion with incubations and new measures of DOM quality  to address a) DOC quality and cycling in boreal lakes, rivers and streams, b) differences in DOM quality between temperate and boreal DOM, and c) the  balance between CO2 production and carbon storage in lakes.

"Ku is an abundant, ubiquitous factor that has been remarkably conserved throughout evolution as it has been identified in all organisms from bacteria to man. Ku is a complex of two proteins that plays an essential role in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks, a form of DNA damage in which both strands of the double helix break, leading to chromosome rearrangements and, ultimately, genomic instability. 

While it is understood that Ku is essential for the proper repair of DNA, its mode of action is still unclear. It is known that Ku interacts with a number of factors that play roles in the repair of DNA, however, the details and the outcome of these interactions are poorly understood. 

Using the crystal structure of Ku that was recently made available, we can predict regions of the protein that are accessible to contact other proteins. In this project, I propose to make mutations in several of these accessible regions and to test if they alter Ku DNA repair functions. The identification of discrete regions of Ku that are important for its function in DNA repair will allow us to identify the proteins that interact with Ku and elucidate how they function together in the repair of DNA. 

Thus, we expect to identify specific motifs in Ku that regulate its activity in DNA repair mechanisms. In the long-term, these analyses will enhance our understanding of the functions of Ku in the mechanisms that are set in place to deal with double-stranded DNA breaks.

"The proposed research is a critical step in our long-term research program to provide new insight and quantification of the effects of climate change on the groundwater and surface water of Canada's subarctic regions. The overall long-term focus is on quantifying the hydrologic, geotechnical, and biogeochemical response of wetland-dominated discontinuous permafrost to atmospheric temperature and solar variations.  Specifically, for this CRD project, large-scale experiments on peat samples from the central Mackenzie River basin will be coupled with on-going field studies to better elucidate active layer moisture transport processes.

          Central to the research is a Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI) funded climate chamber, at the University of Western Ontario Biotron facility, which can reproduce the Canadian subarctic solar and atmospheric environment and house soil monoliths up to 1.5 m in diameter and 4 m in height.  No other similar facility exists in Canada, U.S., or perhaps the world.  Undisturbed peat cores 60 cm in diameter and ~ 75 cm deep, inclusive of vegetation, were taken in August 2007 at our field site near Fort Simpson NWT.  Once the chamber and soil monolith operational parameters have been verified to field conditions, a key component of this CRD project, a wide range of climate forcing experiments (varying solar energy, air temperatures, precipitation, CO2) will be performed.  Of particular interest is to quantify the moisture dynamics at the active-layer / permafrost transition zone and develop numerical models for estimating the position of this interface and the water table during seasonal ground thawing.  These dynamics need to be understood in order to estimate the volume and timing of runoff from wetland-dominated basins in discontinuous permafrost zones.  The experiments will answer critical questions, not addressable by field data alone, on how Canada's subarctic ecosystems will respond to climate change.  Furthermore, validating the climate chamber as a tool to study cold region ecohydrological processes will allow the facility and BioChambers Inc. to be recognized nationally / internationally and stimulate further research and development.

"The objective of my research program is to develop new methods of quantifying and remediating thermal impacts from below-water-table aggregate and rock extraction on cool-water streams.  The focus will be on remedial methods that utilize the aquifer thermal energy generated from the water filled extraction pits for heating and cooling local buildings and neighbourhoods.  In this way not only will cool-water ecosystems and fisheries be protected adjacent to extraction sites but the remedial systems will provide a sustainable energy source.  Currently, we are nearing completion of an unprecedented 10 year field and numerical modelling assessment to quantify the persistence of thermal plumes emanating from an aggregate pit through an unconfined, glacial outwash aquifer.  Our results show that alternating warm and cool plumes persist in the aquifer for 11 months, migrate up to 250 m down gradient, and if sufficient separation distances are not provided, temperature changes of even 2 to 3 degrees C in the hyporheic zone may adversely affect the macroinvertebrate community and incumbent brook trout populations.      )	    )	

     The approach will be to continue the development, verification and field validation of our finite-element numerical model to properly represent groundwater - surface water interactions.  A set of simplified and cost effective numerical / analytical tools for guiding investigations of pit-aquifer-stream operational and risk assessments will be developed and tested at our field site.  Our field validated numerical model will then be used to design and test various shallow aquifer thermal energy extraction and utilization techniques.  Given the seasonal cool and warm water plumes emanating from the pits, proper placement of the system could yield both increased thermal heating in the winter and increased thermal cooling in the summer, over conventional low-temperature geothermal systems where groundwater is close to the mean annual air temperature.  Where utilizing the thermal energy is not cost effective, alternative remedial measures that increase the travel time / distance to cool-water streams, or passive techniques that reduce thermal plume peaks, will be developed.

"The financial wealth of many countries is tied to their resources and manufacturing industries. In Canada, the processing of mining materials and waste disposal are key sources of the release of heavy metals into the environment. Accumulations of these elements in air, water and soils have a severe impact on the health of the environment. Therefore, understanding the fate of a heavy metal in the environment is critical to predict the presence of contaminants in air, water and soil. Predictive understanding requires knowledge regarding the interaction of a specific element-bearing material with the environment and once the element is released, its interaction with geological and barrier materials. My research focuses on the characterization of the release and uptake of heavy metals by minerals and coatings on rocks and minerals. In my ongoing research, I examine the release of Uranium via the dissolution of secondary uranium minerals, a scenario that would likely occur when nuclear waste comes in contact with Oxygen-rich solutions. A short-term goal of this part of my research is a general understanding between the dissolution properties of a secondary uranium mineral (features and kinetic) and its structure and the crystal-chemical properties of the elements in solution. The major part of my future research will be the characterization of the uptake of heavy metals by coatings and alteration phases. The uptake of heavy metals by minerals was dominantly studied using non-altered surfaces. However, mineral surfaces exposed to the atmosphere can be altered or covered by coatings and their interaction with heavy metal thus depends on the composition and structural features of alteration layers or alteration phases in proximity to the ""parent"" minerals. These examinations will include laboratory experiments on the uptake of heavy metals by alteration layers on silicate minerals. Furthermore, coatings and alteration phases will be studied in mine tailings and acidic soils around Sudbury and in the U-deposits of Elliot Lake and Pena Blanca, Mexico. The results from the studies at the U-deposits will give a better understanding on the mobilization of Uranium in mine tailings or nuclear waste repositories that are hosted in silica-rich lithologies.

"This research program uses techniques from various areas of statistics and probability, combined in an innovative way to offer novel formulations with solutions, or to obtain better solutions to specified practical problems. 



(a) Generalized estimating equations(GEEs) provide a semi-parametric approach to longitudinal data analysis. We study the strong consistency, asymptotic normality and aymptotic first-order efficiency of a sequence of GEE estimators. A class of martingale transforms is required and so the full power of martingale theory becomes available, which would result in simpler conditions and proofs. Random covariates will also be considered, which is of interest in control theory, and missing data, of interest in data analysis.   

 

(b) We address the simultaneous and sequential selection of samples for designs commonly use in business surveys. Maximization of the expected overlap of samples reduces the costs of surveys and the variability of estimators over time; minimization decreases response burden. We will study the complex case of strata jumpers and the difficult combinatorial problem of minimizing the overlap for several surveys. 



(c) A product probability space was recently defined, which accomodates design and model-based inference. The porposed project would complete this definition to include Bayesian inference. A complete  description of conditioning in this product space will also be given and one would be able to provide precise definitions of concepts like informative or noninformative sampling.

"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT) are imaging modalities to investigate diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease). The biggest advantage for patients suffering from these diseases is that the actual investigation using these machines is completely non-invasive, involving no pain or discomfort. One drawback however is the use of radioactive substances serving as imaging agents to visualize the cancer or the receptor system involved in brain diseases. In the case of brain diseases only a small fraction of the injected imaging agent reaches the brain (<1%) and the rest of the radioactivity is found in other organs such as liver and kidney contributing to an unwanted radiation burden for the patient. The transport of the imaging agent into the brain is based on a very inefficient process called ""passive diffusion"" where no active transport is involved. We intend to develop a new generation of compounds for brain imaging based on the idea of coupling the imaging agent with a ""molecular shuttle"" responsible for active transport of this conjugate into the brain. A greater fraction of the imaging agent would enter the brain meaning that the overall dose of the compound could be decreased. This would ultimately reduce the radiation burden for the patient making these imaging methods better and also less expensive.","Human pharmaceuticals","McGill University",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Mat�riaux radioactifs","G�nie nucl�aire"

"Canada is a major producer of agriculture based biomass such as corn sugar and seed oils (e.g. canola, corn or soy bean oil) as well as lignins from pulp and paper processing.



Our fundamental research is aimed at the molecular level design and development of new man-made transition metal catalysts that will open new pathways to the production of high value-added non-food products from these locally grown agricultural and forestry commodities. 



The transition metal complex based catalysts to be synthesized and developed achieve this by reducing the oxygen content of the sugar alcohol (e.g. sorbitol and glycerol) and lignin starting materials through a combination of dehydration (loss of water) followed by hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis (addition of hydrogen) reactions that transform them into chemicals that can directly be used in the petrochemical industry for the manufacture of everyday polymers such as Lycra(TM) or Corterra(TM) and Sorona(TM) or phenol based resins.

"Widespread wireless packet and ad hoc networking applications are seen as the next revolution in data communications. Such applications require advanced wireless enabling technologies at the device, system, and computer engineering levels, in particular for ad hoc networks that are to operate without a preestablished infrastructure.



It is well known that the information carrying capacity of such highly flexible and largely uncoordinated wireless networks is strictly limited and grows with a rate less than the number of nodes. In order to make such networks efficient, the most appropriate and advanced signal processing methods need to be applied to the physical layer of these networks. 



Additionally, experiments with known wireless packet protocols such as 802.11 and 802.16 have shown that current accessing methods are inadequate for large uncoordinated ad-hoc networks. New protocol strategies need to be developed which make maxium use of the physical layer capabilities of the individual nodes.



This project addresses these issues from two angles: i) designing and verifying novel signal processing methods, in particular joint detection and interference cancellation methods. These are designed to approach the theoretical maximum information flow at any given node. ii) The design and implementation of novel protocols which are based on traffic and signal statistics to maintain high link throughputs and reliability with a minimum of control messages, thus allowing the network configuration to change dynamically without compromising network performance. An important component is the efficient integration of these two research objectives to demonstrate overall network efficiency.

"A key issue in quantum gravity is to understand how a correct high energy theory that includes gravity, such as string theory, produces classical relativity in its low energy limit. Recent striking results relating black hole entropy derived by classical thermodynamics to that derived from a microcanonical ensemble in string theory hint at a deep connection between these theories, but its detailed nature still eludes us. How is it that our isotropic universe of 4 spacetime dimensions emerged from an initial state of a quantum theory, in particular, one likely formulated in more than 4 dimensions?

     My research seeks to provide general tools and insights key in the search for answers to this issue. One goal is to elucidate the general properties of the dynamics of topological structures. This issue is basic to our understanding of our universe at both the highest energy scales as described by string theory or other fundamental theory and the lowest as described by classical relativity. A second goal is to understand how the diffeomorphism group, the symmetry group of the low energy theory, arises from the structure of quantum gravity at the highest energy scales. A third goal is use gravitational thermodynamics as a tool for further understanding the essential structures needed in the high energy theory. In summary, the interplay between topology, symmetry and dynamics at both high and low energy scales may provide a key guiding principle in the correct formulation of a unifying theory. 

     It is clear that progress in understanding these three aspects of the structure of solutions of the Einstein equations will contribute to this endeavor. The general topological aspects and symmetries of this structure have already proven to provide a useful tool in understanding relationship of the low energy theory to high energy behavior of quantum gravity, perhaps because they are least sensitive to the detailed properties of the dynamics. I anticipate that further study of this issues will yield even more insight into the fundamental laws of our universe.

"It is one of the major challenges for modern Neuroscience to find out how behaviour is generated and modulated in the mammalian brain. Mammalian brains are complex structures mediating complex behavioural tasks. In order to be able to connect cellular and molecular processes within the brain to a specific behavioural task we use a well established simple model - the startle response. Startle responses are mediated by a short primary pathway, they can easily be quantified and they are modulated by sensory gating mechanisms, emotions and different learning processes. This turns startle into a perfect model for studying underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms.

One prominent intrinsic startle modulation is habituation to the repeated presentation of a startle stimulus. Habituation is considered to be one of the most essential learning tasks and we all perform habituation learning throughout our daily life without noticing it. We have combined in vitro electrophysiology with behavioural experiments to unravel the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. After refining the knowledge about the primary startle pathway, we were able to identify the cellular mechanism presumably underlying habituation of startle responses in rodents: secondary sensory neurons within the primary startle pathway are subject to synaptic depression upon repeated activation. Based on this, the goal of our future study is to demonstrate that synaptic depression and short term habituation are closely related. We further want to elucidate the molecular processes that lead to synaptic depression and eventually to habituation. In addition, we aim to identify different neurotransmitter receptors and pathways that are able to interfere with the startle pathway and are therefore candidates to mediate sensory gating and emotional effects on startle. Our work will provide the first comprehensive description of a mammalian learning process and will help to significantly advance the basic knowledge about how human and animal brains generate behaviour and behavioural plasticity.

"The objective of this research is to understand the impact of deciduous species on nutrient availability, nutrient cycling, soil properties and site productivity of conifer forests. Specifically, the research will focus on the impact of bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) and black cottonwood (Populus balsamifera ssp. Trichocarpa) growing in conifer forest in the Pacific Northwest. The research will involve a comparison of soil properties and nutrient dynamics in plots located under deciduous trees (bigleaf maple or black cottonwood) with those in the surrounding conifer forest.  Paired deciduous/conifer plots will be selected for each species.  Throughfall and stemflow, and the role of epiphytes will be studied for bigleaf maple plots. Litter fall rates, nutrient inputs in litterfall, litter decay, and properties of forest floor and mineral soil will be investigated for black cottonwood plots.  Three to four graduate students and 2 undergraduate students will be involved in this research program. They will obtain considerable experience in carrying out field and laboratory work.



This research is potentially of great theoretical and practical significance. It builds upon my past investigations of soil properties and nutrient dynamics associated with bigleaf and vine maple (Acer circinatum) in B.C.  The proposed study will investigate nutrient inputs in throughfall and stemflow as well as the role of epiphytes associated with bigleaf maple in the nutrient cycle of conifer forest.  Furthermore, I propose to carry out the first detailed investigation of soil properties and nutrient dynamics beneath black cottonwood growing in conifer forest. The results of this research have implications for forest management and conservation. If results show that soil properties are 'improved' under bigleaf maple and/or under black cottonwood this may imply that management that includes a component of bigleaf maple and/or black cottonwood within conifer forest is beneficial for forest productivity and ecosystem health.

"Articular cartilage is the tissue at the ends of long bones that bears load and slides relative to an apposing tissue surface in a fluid filled cavity. Such tissue-tissue interfaces in the body are called biointerfaces. The nearly frictionless articulation of cartilage in knee joints is due to the remarkable lubrication properties of cartilage and the surrounding synovial fluid. Boundary lubrication is an essential mechanism of articular cartilage lubrication where surface-to-surface contact of apposing cartilage surfaces occurs, and surface bound molecules enhance lubrication. This mode of lubrication is particularly important for the protection and maintenance of articular cartilage, and is thought to be due to interactions of molecules in synovial fluid with the articular surface. Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), classically referred to as 'lubricin', and hyaluronan are two such molecules in synovial fluid that are also present at the surface of articular cartilage. PRG4 and hyaluronan, both alone and in combination, provide boundary lubrication of articular cartilage. The physical properties of molecules like PRG4 are generally determined by their ability to form aggregate structures called multimers. Indeed, PRG4 has recently been shown to exist in normal synovial fluid as multimers. The goal is this work is therefore to determine if the aggregation of PRG4 that occurs in normal synovial fluid affects its ability to interact with hyaluronan, to adhere to the surface of articular cartilage, and thereby function as an effective boundary lubricant. The planned experiments will use a unique combination of novel biochemical and biomechanical methods to first purify PRG4 molecules from synovial fluid, then assess their ability to interact with hyaluronan and the articular surface, and finally to provide boundary lubricating function. This work will result in significant advances in basic science by contributing to the understanding of a fundamental cartilage lubrication mechanism relevant to knee joint integrity (and potentially other biointerfaces), and orthopeadic bioengineering by providing the basis for potential development of new synovial fluid therapeutics in Canada for the treatment of injured joints or maintenance of healthy joints.

"Rocks are complex and intriguing materials. In the earth, their physical properties vary with mineral composition, fluid content, tectonic straining, and temperature. Geophysicists probe the earth remotely with seismic and electromagnetic waves; but informed assessments of the field observations require knowledge of the relation between rock properties and in situ conditions. Rock physicists strive to learn more about these relationships and to apply them to field data. The Experimental Geophysics Group led by Dr. Schmitt studies these properties in the laboratory and, uniquely, by field measurements. This research uses tools that range from tiny ultrasonic transducers to large truck mounted seismic energy sources.  One problem is that the values of, say,  a seismic wave speed given by these varied measurements can be quite different.  For example, a seismic wave speed at seismic frequencies will often be substantially less than that obtained using ultrasonic waves. We will address this problem two ways. First, we will constrain this seismic dispersion in the laboratory using 'forced oscillation' methods that will partly employ a new instrument being constructed in our laboratory.  Second, we will continue to make fundamental measurements of the behaviour of seismic waves as they travel through a liquid-saturated porous medium in order to test the limits of existing theories.  A third component of the research  studies the factors controlling the propagation of radar waves that are used to probe near earth structure.  This work will be integrated as much as possible with parallel field geophysical studies related to scientific drilling, near-surface hazard characterization, and time-lapse monitoring.  Students working in the Experimental Geophysics Group are exposed to a wide range of geoscience problems and all are expected to broaden their exposure by participation in field projects; in the last few years these have ranged over 4 continents and both polar regions.

"We are particularly interested in exploiting the potential of interlocked molecules such as rotaxanes and pseudorotaxanes in both chemistry and biology.



The supramolecular strategy of the catalyst assembly involves the assembly of a catalytic site-containing thread designed to accommodate wheels by forming a pseudorotaxane system. This supramolecular strategy enables modification of steric and electronic functionalities on the backbone of the ligand and template molecule. The possibility of turning single catalyst into many variants by changing the wheels without synthetic effort may be useful for the screening of many catalyst in a short time. 



We are investigating the catalytic properties of biohybrid threaded systems for the modification of polymeric threads, in which the rotaxane's wheel is constituted by a toroidal protein. Since folate-containing polymers are labile and contain stereocentres, they could benefit from the gentle conditions and high efficacy of this enzymatic synthesis.



We are involved in the design of new umbrella-rotaxanes for the passive transport of polar, biologically active agents (which represent the rotaxane's wheel) across lipid membranes.

"Sensory systems are designed to extract information relevant to the perceiver's survival from a background that is often complex and noisy. Consider the task facing a person who is attempting to listen to a companion when they are walking together down a busy  and noisy street.  The companion's speech is but one component of the auditory scene.  To perceive, understand, and respond to the speech signal, the listener must not only ""pull out"" the words and sentences from the background noise, she or he must determine their meaning, relate the information obtained to past experience and world knowledge, and then formulate an appropriate response.  All this must be done while also using the visual information to guide one's path while walking so as to avoid obstacles, some of them potentially lethal.  To accomplish this feat, the perceptual systems employ a number of signal-processing strategies to reduce background noise.  First, the auditory system identifies and locates sources of sound and then links them to the appropriate visual object.  Once the system has focussed in on one of these sources (the companion's voice) it filters out most of the high frequencies in the auditory scene, such as those produced by a streetcar or horn and suppresses information coming from irrelevant sources (other voices).  It also ""boosts"" the gain on the companion's signal.  One part of this proposal studies how the auditory system identifies and locates sound sources.  Another part focusses on how the auditory system enhances one source relative to others.

    We also know that the ability of the auditory system to accomplish these tasks diminishes with age.  A third part of this research attempts to characterize the nature of these age-related changes in hearing so that we can develop strategies and assistive devices to compensate for them.

"The long-term research objective is to develop reliable,  theoretically sound means for scaling from field measurements and experiments (typically at a small spatial and temporal scales) to questions of human impact on the environment, which typically occurs at far larger scales.  Reliable calculations at large spatial scales are required throughout applied ecology, including habitat-based research in conservation biology, estimating rates of change in biodiversity,  anticipating the impacts of climate change, management of fisheries, and science-based assessment of point-source and regional environmental impacts. 

       The primary objective of this proposal is to show that the science base for applied ecology can be improved by developing  and testing spatial scaling functions based on a generalised scaling relation (Schneider 2001).  Scaling functions will be developed in collaboration with two doctoral students (fishery bycatch, marine contaminants).    For the problem of fishery bycatch, the research hypothesis will be that the exponent that scales catch to effort will decrease in fisheries where intervention reduces catch. The resulting knowledge of variation in exponent will improve estimates of total bycatch.  For the problem of contaminants, the research hypothesis will be that risk scales exponentially with contaminant body burden, which in turn scales allometrically with body size.  The resulting knowledge will improve the efficiency of monitoring activities.

     A third objective of this proposal is to discover the mechanisms responsible for spatial structure of eelgrass habitat, which is known to govern the density and feeding success of newly recruited cod.

     Process based scaling functions are more reliable than empirical function and thus improve the science base of applied ecology.

"The American lobster (Homarus americanus) fishery has a landed value of $ 550 million/year in Atlantic

Canada, and has long been a mainstay of inshore fishers. In Newfoundland, the industry has undertaken a

number of measures aimed at sustainable harvest, notably the adoption of a maximum size limit in 4 fishing

areas and locally-supported closed areas within one of these areas and three other fishing areas. We propose to

use reproductive value to evaluate the efficacy of these measures. Reproductive value is an established concept

in population biology but has not been applied to fisheries, due largely to data demands. It is thus more suited

to evaluation of risks and policy than to ongoing assessment. Reproductive value combines the mortality and

fecundity schedule to quantify the value of the individual to the population. It thus differs from standard

assessment methods, such as yield per recruit, which focus on biomass and economic value. The goals of this

research will be: (1) Calculate stage- age- and size specific reproductive value of lobsters in Newfoundland; (2)

Identify major sources of variation, notably geographic variation in fecundity at size, molt schedules, and

mortality schedules; and (3) Identify the upper and lower size limits that maximize reproductive value relative

to landed value; (4) Estimate the spatial scale at which small closed areas increase reproductive value of lobster

populations; (5) Promote stewardship on the science basis of reproductive value relative to economic value.",Environment,"Memorial University of Newfoundland","2 & 3","STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","�cologie aquatique et limnologie","�volution et �cologie"
"The objectives of this program are to develop robust computational methods for fluid flow and heat transfer that are accurate, economical, and span the entire range of flow regimes, and to apply these methods in the design cycle for applications including the microfluidic 'lab-on-a-chip'. While the accuracy is in place, at least for moderate Mach numbers, the economy, entire range, and design application issues require attention. In contrast to direct sparse solvers used to date, iterative, conjugate gradient, multigrid and multiblock methods will be examined for application to the all-speed algorithm. To further extend the Mach range into the hypersonic range will require more advanced techniques. These will include the consideration of different linearizations of density and their influence on convergence and stability.



A study will be conducted on the application to design applications including high temperature difference convection, porous media , turbulent flows. microfluidic flows, and 'lab-on-a-chip'. Application to microfluidics offersa great potential for the design of micro reactors and the injection and separation of DNA samples. It is expected that the algorithm can be used to examine the injection process, and to change it dynamically, to produce optimal sample configurations, so that maximal resolution of the DNA components, for example, can be realized.



In summary, the proposed research program is directed at making the transition from a highly promising algorithm that offers all-speed performance, under constrained conditions, to a fully integrated algorithm that will meet the robustness, economics, all flow regime, and design requirements for an all purpose engineering design tool.

To this end, I will investigate automated software engineering and computer science techniques to facilitate software change, either when the software is being designed or when the system is running.



The research addresses software evolution issues of large-scale software systems, but will focus on next generation interactive systems in particular. The interactive systems to be investigated are characterized by their use of aspects such as: novel interaction techniques; 3D graphics; interactive simulation; end user languages; and the utilization of large high resolution display spaces.

"Free-space optical (FSO) communication refers to the transmission of information via modulated visible or infrared (IR) optical band emissions through the atmosphere. FSO is particularly interesting for last-mile broadband connectivity as it can virtually extend the high speed fiber backbone network to the subscriber's premises at comparatively low cost. There is a large demand for this type of connectivity since, for example, approximately 75% of commercial buildings in the US are within 1 km of a major fiber trunk, but only 5% of these are connected to that trunk. However, FSO is also favorably applied as fiber back up, in meteropolitan area networks, and in space communications. When compared to more conventional RF wireless links, FSO enables significantly higher data rates, is not affected by co- or adjacent-channel interference, and offers inherent security due to the high directivity of the light beam. Furthermore, FSO systems are lightweight and rapidly deployable, do not require expensive spectrum licensing, and are inexpensive compared to fiber or RF systems. Despite these advantages and a growing interest in this technology from both industry and academia, widespread deployment of FSO faces three primary challenges: (1) For reliable communication the FSO transmitter has to directly illuminate the FSO receiver. Misalignment between transmitter and receiver leads to large fluctuations in the received signal intensity. (2) Atmospheric turbulence causes fading in FSO links. This leads to signal intensity fluctuations in both space and time. (3) Adverse weather conditions such as fog, heavy rain, and heavy snow can severely attenuate FSO links. The overall goal of the proposed research project is to develop new intelligent signal processing techniques that can overcome these challenges and facilitate the widespread deployment of FSO technology. This requires fundamental research on (a) the modeling of urban FSO channels, (b) coding and modulation for FSO systems, (c) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) FSO systems, and (d) signal design for hybrid FSO-RF systems.","Communications technologies (satellites, radar, etc.)","University of British Columbia",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Syst�mes de t�l�communications sans fil","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique"

The smallest contractile units of muscles have two filament systems, the thick and thin filaments that slide past each other to generate contractile force. A mutation in Lasp results in shorter thin filaments, and therefore impaired muscle function, as the contractile force that can be generated with shorter thin filaments is smaller. We will investigate how Lasp regulates thin filament length with genetic, biochemical, and advanced imaging methods, such as live imaging of thin filament turnover. These basic cell biological studies will shed light on important aspects of muscle function in development and disease.","Advancement of knowledge","McGill University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Cytosquelette,"Biologie cellulaire"
"Our lab studies the evolution of modifiers of the mating system, and more generally, genes that bias their own transmission. We propose to conduct studies of the evolution and loss of self-incompatibility (SI) in the plant genus Leavenworthia.   This research will investigate mating system evolution from the level of the population on down to the gene sequence, and will focus on variation at the S-locus. Considerable progress has been made in the past 10 years by researchers who have cloned and sequenced this locus in the related genus Arabidopsis. We will capitalize upon this knowledge to extend the study of evolution and loss of SI to a plant group whose ecology has been well characterized.  We have already made significant progress on a number of components of this project, starting with the use of PCR primers that target a number of conserved regions of the S-locus as the means to clone and sequence the gene.  Our goals include: (1) confirmation that amplified products correspond to the S-locus; (2) development and testing of new and existing theory for allele genealogy and the dynamics of mutations at the S-locus that lead to self-compatibility; (3) examination of the effect of population size variation on mate availability and fecundity in SI populations; (4) tests for a selective sweep at the S-locus in self-compatible populations of Leavenworthia species; (5) using ancient S-locus polymorphism data to assist in reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the mating system in Leavenworthia species; (6) tests for the sheltering from selection of deleterious mutations in the S-locus region.  Collectively, this research will extend our understanding of the evolution of self-fertilization in plants.  Also proposed is the completion of a project to investigate the early stages of transposable element (TE) sequence evolution accompanying the ""invasion"" of a new genome by a heterologous TE (TE from another species) into experimental populations of yeast.  The two projects are conceptually related in that both are concerned with the evolution of genes that have the ability to bias their own transmission, a topic that our lab has explored for more than 20 years.

"Sustainability of agricultural production on the Canadian prairies requires that the nutrients that are applied to soils are effectively recycled rather than lost to the environment.  Fertilizers also represent a significant input cost to farmers and greater efficiency in their use contributes to better economic returns.



Cropping systems on the prairies today are moving towards reduced or zero-tillage, more land is receiving application of animal manures, and land is being converted from production of annual crops into forages.  The forms and transformations of phosphorus in the new systems is not well documented.  Producers have reported less need for nitrogen fertilizer and some are now reporting less requirement for added phosphorus.  To make better fertilization and land use decisions it is necessary to understand the phosphorus cycle in these conservation - oriented cropping systems.

"The technology is now available to modify sounds in realtime on their way through the human ear using sophisticated miniaturized signal processing devices that can be worn inside the ear canal. The central idea of the proposed line of research is to use such ""digital ear plugs"" to selectively manipulate different aspects of the acoustic information in humans, and to use advanced human brain imaging and behavioral testing to study changes in the layout of auditory cortical fields. Digital ear plugs are made of silicone plugs that are molded to a person's ear canal to create a perfect acoustic seal that blocks the natural sound path. In the plug is a powerful miniature signal processor connected to a miniature microphone on the outer surface of the plug and a miniature loudspeaker on the inner side of the plug that points towards the eardrum. The natural path of the sound through the ear can thus be replaced by an electronic path that is under complete experimental control. Intra-ear realtime sound manipulation is a conceptually simple and powerful technique to induce ecologically valid and controlled changes in the sensory input to the human ear. Our goal is to gain a deeper theoretical understanding of the principles that govern how sensory experience shapes cortical function in humans, and how these processes are influenced by motivation and attention. We will use auditory spatial processing as an experimental model. Our ability to localize a sound source relies on complex neural computations that translate tiny acoustic cues into representations of an external location. The visual system plays an important role in teaching the auditory system how to translate the cues. Visually guided auditory plasticity is highly quantifiable and demonstrates mechanisms and principles of learning and plastic change that may be used widely throughout the central nervous system.

Two main projects are of particular interest:  The first concerns the effects of flow and confinement of grafted, dense polymers in micro and nano-channels.  Polymers in such channels can act as pressure-activated switches that restrict flow at low pressure differentials but untangle and order when the pressures between input and output ends of a channel differ signicantly.  The details dynamics in such systems are not well understood.  



A second project concerns the explicit role of water in the dynamics of structural transitions in biological systems.  In many studies of structure of biopolymers, the effect of a water solvent on the biomolecules has been described in a simplified manner in which the solvent changes the way in which different parts of the molecule interact with one another and dynamical effects in which water molecules stabilize intermediate structures during conformational changes are ignored.  The validity of such an approach will be examined using simplified dynamical models of solvated biomolecules.  These studies are designed to identify which aspects of aqueous solutions are essential in simple models of protein folding.

"There are several applications that take advantage of the light-emitting properties of nanoscale systems, with diodes and lasers, single-photon sources, and bio-labels being notable examples. Additionally, however, a growing and very important area of application for these same materials is in the field of renewable energy and the harvesting of solar photons. For this application, rather complex blends of 'soft materials' are fabricated to serve the purposes of capturing incident light and converting that energy ultimately to electrical energy. Researchers believe that nanoscale systems are well-suited for this purpose because they are highly tunable and are easily processible. The challenge is to learn how to control and direct the evolution of the special quantum states that store the energy of the captured light. These states live for, at most, only nanoseconds before they disintegrate to heat, and during their brief lifetime they evolve in highly complicated ways. By learning to control these ultrafast processes occurring on the length scale of molecules, we will be able design means of

optimizing the harvesting of light and its conversion into electrical energy. Examination of the challenges to developing an efficient, yet affordable, organic solar cell technology raises some fascinating questions that address road blocks for future progress, and these concepts are the subject of this research.","Physical sciences","University of Toronto",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Photochimie et photophysique","Chimie physique"

"Glaciers are an important seasonal source of freshwater in many places around the world, including the Canadian West. Continental-scale ice sheets such as those in Greenland and Antarctica play an important role in regulating global sea levels. Both types of ice masses are sensitive to their ambient climate through snowfall and melting, and their response to a change in climate depends crucially on how the ice in them flows. Sliding of ice over bedrock or sediments is often a major component in the overall flow of a glacier or ice sheet, and sliding speeds can vary dramatically according to the input of lubricating meltwater to the bed. Computer simulations of glacier and ice sheet dynamics therefore require an accurate representation of sliding. However, due to the inaccessibility of most glacier beds, direct studies of glacier sliding have been limited and many simulations rely on purely theoretical models of sliding. The proposed research aims to provide better observational constraints on models of sliding. Specifically, I will use Global Positioning System and satellite-based radar technology to measure spatial and temporal variations in the sliding speed of a glacier in the Yukon Territory. Using a mathematical tool known as an inverse model, friction at the bed will be calculated from these measurements, and will be correlated to direct measurements of water pressure at the base of the glacier obtained through in-situ instrumentation. The aim of the research is to establish quantitative links between friction at the glacier bed, sliding velocity and the pressure of lubricating basal water.

"The ice sheets of Greenland and West Antarctica contain sufficient fresh water to raise global sea levels by about 13 metres. At present, there are no reliable predictions of how fast these ice sheets may shrink under projected climate change, and the future rate of sea level rise cannot be forecast accurately. Better predictions of ice sheet behaviour will require a number of physical processes to be represented more accurately in numerical models. Ice sheets do not flow evenly, but contain channels of fast flow known as ice streams. How these ice streams form, evolve and ultimately shut down again is only partially understood, and much of the physics involved is not represented in currebt ice sheet models. Similarly, the physics that controls the evolution of the edges of ice sheets (and hence their horizontal extent) is only partially understood. In particular, the edges of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are defined in many places by the location where ice begins to float and forms an ice shelf. The rate at which ice flows through these junctions between ice sheets and ice shelves cannot be predicted accurately by present models, hampering efforts to estimate future sea level changes. The proposed research program will target these weaknesses in current ice sheet models by addressing the fundamental physics involved in ice stream flow and in the evolution of the margins of ice sheets. The research program will take a two-pronged approach, using sophisticated modern mathematical methods in conjunction with data from a new field program to derive improved representation of ice sheet physics for use in numerical simulations.

"Discontinuous Galerkin methods are specialized numerical methods for the computer simulation of complex phenomena in the sciences and engineering. Although the first discontinuous Galerkin method was devised back in 1973, these methods experienced a significant development during the nineties which brought them to the mainstream of computational fluid dynamics. In recent years, these methods are being applied to many other problems of engineering interest including electro-magnetics and structural mechanics. The recent success of discontinuous Galerkin methods can be attributed to their flexibility and versatility. These methods can deal robustly with partial differential equations of almost any kind, as well as with equations whose type changes within the computational domain. They are ideally suited for multi-physics applications and for problems with highly varying material properties in complex geometries. Moreover, discontinuous Galerkin methods can easily handle irregularly refined meshes and variable approximation degrees; a property referred to as hp-adaptivity.



The long-term objectives of this proposal are the development, analysis and implementation of discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods for the improved simulation of problems in computational fluid mechanics and electro-magnetics. In particular, we plan to address some of the most relevant issues of the current development of discontinuous Galerkin methods: the design of new methods that have fewer globally coupled degrees of freedom, the development of exactly divergence-free methods, the analysis of new and robustly convergent adaptive algorithms, and the devising of new solvers and implementation techniques. We further plan to develop a flexible simulation code for problems in incompressible fluid flow and electro-magnetics, which incorporates modern developments in computational mathematics, such as hp-adaptivity, efficient iterative solvers, and high-order time-stepping.

"This project will bring together two research groups with complementary expertise led by Dr. John Schrader, a medically-trained, internationally recognized immunologist, and Dr. Carl Hansen a physicist and engineer who is a leader in innovation in the new science of microfluidics. Together these interdisciplinary teams will develop a novel and innovative device that will address a pivotal problem in basic and applied medical research - the rapid and inexpensive generation of high-value monoclonal antibodies.   Monoclonal antibodies are counterparts of the antibodies in our blood that protect us from infections by binding to viruses or toxins and are responsible for immunity to diseases we have encountered before. Antibodies have the unique property thai they come in millions of different shapes. A ""monoclonal antibody "" is a pure preparation of one antibody with its one particular shape and different monoclonal antibodies can be selected to fight a virus or target a cancer. Monoclonal antibodies are the fastest growing class of new therapeutic agents and are providing breakthrough treatments e.g for cancers of the breast, colon, lymphatic tissues and others (Herceptin, Erbitux, Rituximab, Avastin) and arthritis and Crohn's disease (Remicade, Humira). The ability to find a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to virtually any substance is also of enormous medical and commercial importance in the diagnosis of disease and in biomedical research. Despite this enormous potential, the discovery and production of high-quality antibodies by conventional means is a major bottleneck. Current techniques are expensive, require months or years of development, and are not compatible with the production of antibodies that can be easily used in humans. This project will merge state-of-the-art techniques in microengineering, immunology, and biophotonics to enable a postage stamp-size device to make sensitive measurements on the antibodies made by thousands of single cells and copy the genetic recipes for antibodies with useful characteristics, so that they can be made in unlimited quantities as human or rabbit monoclonal antibodies for use as therapies or as reagents.

"Biofilms are defined as microbial communities adhering and growing on a solid surface while embedding themselves in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Compared to planktonic cells, bacteria growing in a biofilm demonstrate increased resistance to desiccation, sanitizers and other antimicrobial agents. In the food industry, biofilms are an increasing concern as they may provide niches in processing environments where pathogens and spoilage organisms can survive for extended periods of time. It has also been demonstrated that biofilm-associated bacteria can detach from food contact surfaces resulting in food contamination. This research will investigate the mechanisms of biofilm formation of the foodborne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter jejuni. 



In the next five years, the research will concentrate on the following short term goals:

i. to characterize biofilm structures, spatial cell distribution, viability and culturability of single- and mixed species biofilms grown with L. monocytogenes and Pseudomonas spp.,

ii. to evaluate at the genome- and proteome-level the growth-inhibiting and growth-enhancing effects of Pseudomonas secreted substances on Listeria monocytogenes,

iii. to determine the effect of Campylobacter jejuni biofilm growth on strains' ability to survive in aerobic environments and to invade cell cultures, and 

iv. to investigate the effects of reactive oxygen species on Campylobacter jejuni grown in biofilms.



The knowledge gained from the work proposed here will provide the basis to develop effective intervention strategies to minimize and eliminate biofilm growth in food production environments.

"My research program falls into the general area of computational and quantum chemistry. The growing relevance of this field has been recognized with the 1998 Nobel Prize in Chemistry that has been awarded to W. Kohn and the late J. Pople, two outstanding pioneers of the field. Within this framework, the principal, long-term goals of my research are twofold. 

First, computational quantum chemistry has reached a point where it can be used by chemists as one of several standard, ""black-box"" approaches for solving certain problems. This is the case for instance for organic chemistry of small and medium-sized molecules. Yet, the same kind of maturity has not been reached in other areas. My first goal, then, is to develop computational quantum chemistry methods into valuable and reliable research tools for areas where they have not yet reached their full potential. One such area concerns modeling of extended systems (solids, surfaces, etc.), where my group will develop extensive new quantum-chemical methods for the simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) parameters. Another area comprises the chemistry of the heaviest parts of the periodic table, the actinide elements. These elements present unique challenges to the researcher. Here, I will build on a range of existing local and international collaborations to develop new methods (chiefly concerning relativistic effects) and to apply and test methods that have not been used in this connection. 

As the second principal research goal, I aim at developing a solid understanding of the chemistry of the actinide elements (uranium, neptunium, plutonium, among others) from theory and computations alone, so as to avoid difficult and dangerous experiments with radioactive materials as much as possible. In this field, which can be described as ""theoretical actinide molecular science"", I will focus on modelling molecules in aqueous solution as well as selective extraction agents and related complexes. These are systems that are relevant to the nuclear waste problem at contaminated sites (for instance, uranium mine tailings in Canada's North).

"The well-established paradigm of drug discovery involves targeting a specific protein with a specific compound to alter its function.  Most often, these proteins are enzymes or receptors that can be linked in some fashion to disease processes.  But as we unravel biological matter at the molecular level, we begin to see that a great many protein functions are integrated in very complex molecular machines.  Our research program begins with this idea:  if we can develop new technologies for understanding the assembly and function of these machines at a high resolution, a new therapeutic paradigm more sophisticated than the ""one-protein, one-drug"" approach could be developed.  Our research addresses the development, testing and evolution of technology for such purposes.  Our goals involve the development of mass spectrometry for the analysis of protein structure, assembly and dynamics, but we realize that this powerful technology will be insufficient for generating the degree of resolution we need to understand function.  Computational methods will be developed to enhance the value of the data generated by mass spectrometry.  With the successful development and maturation of this ""merged"" approach, we hope initiate new projects in therapeutics development focused on cancer treatment.

"Cretaceous sedimentary basins in Western and Arctic Canada are the largest hydrocarbon producers in Canada.

"The funds requested in this proposal will serve to provide the resources required to carry out the PI's new research program on ""Understanding and coping with failure at scale"". The goal of this new research program is to address the age-old problem of building highly reliable computer systems in a novel way. The key observation is that, although system reliability has been a key concern since the first computer systems were build 50 years ago, embarrassingly little is known about basic characteristics of failures in real systems, since virtually no data on failures in production systems is publicly available. As a result, much research is based on hypothetical and often simplistic assumptions.



The broad goal of the PI's new research program is to enable the creation of more reliable systems through a detailed understanding of real-world failures. The motivation for this research program comes from the PI's initial results on failure data analysis, which show that many common assumptions about failures are not realistic and that making those assumptions can lead to highly sub-optimal solutions. These results indicate a strong need for a better understanding of failures in the real world and more realistic failure models, based on empirical data. The PI plans to analyze large amounts of failure data from real production systems in order to derive insights into the root cause of failures, statistical properties of failures and more realistic failure models, and then use this knowledge to develop better methods for avoiding, coping with and recovering from failures.

"    )	    )	Plants are very sensitive to light. When grown in the dark, such as under a rock or board, plant seedlings are tall, thin, pale, and keep their leaves closed.  Bean sprouts are an example of this type of growth.  When plants grow in the light though they are short and green with leaves open to absorb the sunlight.  Our studies in the mustard relative Arabidopsis have centred around a mutant, det1, that is defective in this process - it looks like a light-grown plant even when grown in the dark.  This suggests that DET1 is normally an important part of how the plant responds to light.  We are trying to understand how DET1 performs this role.  We have found that the DET1 protein interacts with a protein called Damaged DNA-Binding protein 1 (DDB1).  DDB1 was originally identified in humans, where it is involved in the repair of UV-damaged DNA.  DDB1 activity is defective in some human xeroderma pigmentosa patients.  These people are at risk for skin cancer because they are unable to repair DNA damage caused by UV light.  Our result is very exciting because it suggests that there may be a common mechanism of responding to ""good"" light, which makes plants grow, and ""bad"" UV light, which is damaging to all life forms.  We hope by studying DET1 and DDB1 to help design crop plants with both optimal light response and UV protective capacity.

"My research develops new mathematical concepts to extend statistical principles so that they can be applied to large and complex modern databases. The computational challenge is to develop efficient programs that can apply these algorithms to rapidly sift and identify useful information-essentially revealing diamonds in the rough. 



Vast amounts of data are gathered daily for different purposes. As more and more organizations and companies accumulate data, a crucial competitive edge comes with the ability to efficiently find informative patterns in the data and to learn from it to improve decision-making. This process requires computational tools for extracting information from data records. 



The proposed research combines fundamental time-tested statistical concepts with new machine learning technology to provide practical data analysis tools that have a strong theoretical foundation. The most successful learning programs are based on statistical concepts. The problem is that these concepts were invented for relatively simple domains, like a group of patients, and are not well-suited to handle the rich structure of modern databases. In modern databases we may have many different types of entities that interact in different ways; for example planes, passengers, pilots, flight attendants, and airports are all related to each other in different ways. Computer models that integrate relationships form the basis of learning programs that make queries possible and predict intelligent mathematical solutions from information profiles.

"Temperature is an important factor influencing the distribution and abundance of fish. Despite several decades of study, however, we still do not have a complete understanding of how fish respond to changes in environmental temperature during their lifetimes, or how adaptation to environmental change occurs over evolutionary time. 

   We use a small minnow-like fish, the mummichog, as a model to address these questions. In the proposed research we will characterize aspects of performance in mummichogs from northern and southern populations exposed to a variety of different environmental temperatures. In particular, we will test the hypothesis that the increased metabolism required for adaptation to low temperatures comes at a cost of increased sensitivity to high temperatures. We will then relate these performance characteristics to differences in gene expression between the populations using a variety of molecular approaches, including DNA microarray. We will also directly explore the link between genotype and phenotype using hybrid fish from intermediate populations, and laboratory genetic crosses.

    Our previous work led us to suggest that changes in stress hormones may be an important component of adaptation to temperature in mummichugs. Therefore, we will also make a detailed characterization of various aspects of the stress-response in these fish, both at the molecular and physiological levels.

    This research will provide an understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying responses to temperature changes on both short and long time scales. This understanding will be particularly critical given the likely effects of global climate change.

"Our work strives to understand the molecular mechanisms controlling vein formation.  The vascular system is fundamental to plant structure and function, providing a skeleton and efficient transport routes for water, photosynthates, essential nutrients, pathogens and signaling compounds.  Thus, our findings may impact plant modifications designed to produce more wood, withstand drought stress, or improve photosynthetic capacity.  The factors identified as being important to vein formation are primarily involved in transport of or response to the plant hormone, auxin.  Auxin is fundamental to a huge number of plant developmental processes, including embryo polarity, root organization, placement of branch roots and leaves and response to gravity and light. In all processes directional auxin transport through asymmetric placement of auxin influx and efflux proteins on cell membranes is critical to auxin function.  While control of auxin efflux is increasingly well understood, little is known about the control of auxin influx.  Vein pattern seems to be sufficiently complex that screens for vein pattern mutants reveal novel components in auxin transport and response, with either redundant roles or effects too subtle to be detected in classical screens.  Thus, beyond providing a better understanding of vascular formation, our work will reveal molecular mechanisms controlling auxin localization and activity throughout plant development. We propose to dissect the role of four genes - AUTOBAHN (ABN), FORKED1 (FKD1), UNHINGED (UNH) and GRASSY (GSY) - identified by mutation. Plants mutant in ABN make highly disordered veins and alter placement of leaves.  Our data suggest that these plants are defective in auxin influx, and thus represent the first mutation that links auxin influx to leaf position and vein pattern.  We plan experiments to find out what product ABN makes, and how it influences auxin influx.   The FKD1 gene product is a protein with a domain indicative of involvement in properly localizing the auxin efflux protein to the cell membrane.  We will test this idea.  Finally, we will identify and characterize both UNH and GSY whose mutant phenotypes suggest a role in auxin transport or signaling.

"Almost all data is now digitally stored, with unprecedented computing power available to process it.  These developments have created new opportunities to advance computer interpretation (e.g. natural language processing, computer perception) and intelligent data-analysis (e.g. bio-informatics) by analyzing the massive amounts of complex data stored in text, multimedia, and scientific repositories.  My research addresses the fundamental challenge of synthesizing predictive models from data, focusing on the problem of learning structured predictors in the presence of latent variables and incomplete observations.  These challenges are motivated by the fact that predictions in complex domains are not just simple class labels or scalar values, but are complex structured outputs---such as parse trees, scene labellings or graph labellings---that involve multiple outputs to be predicted in a coordinated fashion, often with intervening latent variables.  The key problem is training complex predictors when some of the output or intervening latent variables are unobserved.

   To tackle these problems, I employ two key strategies.  First, I exploit probability models, which specify optimal interpretations from noisy, incomplete and conflicting evidence.  Thus, one aspect of my research focuses on developing new algorithms for learning and inference in structured probability models.  Second, I formulate convex training principles for the implied learning problems.  Convexity decouples parameter optimization from model quality: a poor result arises from poor model structure, not a poor local minimum.  A further key insight is that supervised training can be extended to unsupervised or semi-supervised training by following a self-supervised approach, where missing data components are treated as auxiliary variables to be optimized (i.e. inferred) simultaneously with parameter optimization.

"Almost all data is now digitally stored, with unprecedented computing power available to process it.  These developments have created new opportunities to advance computer interpretation (e.g. natural language processing, computer perception) and intelligent data-analysis (e.g. bio-informatics) by analyzing the massive amounts of complex data stored in text, multimedia, and scientific repositories.  My research addresses the fundamental challenge of synthesizing predictive models from data, focusing on the problem of learning structured predictors in the presence of latent variables and incomplete observations.  These challenges are motivated by the fact that predictions in complex domains are not just simple class labels or scalar values, but are complex structured outputs---such as parse trees, scene labellings or graph labellings---that involve multiple outputs to be predicted in a coordinated fashion, often with intervening latent variables.  The key problem is training complex predictors when some of the output or intervening latent variables are unobserved.

   To tackle these problems, I employ two key strategies.  First, I exploit probability models, which specify optimal interpretations from noisy, incomplete and conflicting evidence.  Thus, one aspect of my research focuses on developing new algorithms for learning and inference in structured probability models.  Second, I formulate convex training principles for the implied learning problems.  Convexity decouples parameter optimization from model quality: a poor result arises from poor model structure, not a poor local minimum.  A further key insight is that supervised training can be extended to unsupervised or semi-supervised training by following a self-supervised approach, where missing data components are treated as auxiliary variables to be optimized (i.e. inferred) simultaneously with parameter optimization.  A natural convex formulation of joint training can then be obtained by working with equivalence relations over missing components.  This approach has led to fundamental advances in unsupervised and semi-supervised training, including state of the art extensions to support vector machines, maximum margin Markov networks, and expectation-maximization.

"Proline is unique among the proteinogenic amino acids as its side chain is fused to the peptide backbone. As a consequence, there is a reduction in the energy difference between the prolyl amide cis and trans isomers, making them nearly isoenergetic; this leads to a higher cis N-terminal amide population relative to other amino acids. Moreover, the isomerization of the prolyl amide bond has been shown to be the rate-determining step in the folding pathway of many peptides and proteins. Besides exhibiting unique conformational properties and inducing important secondary structures (beta-turns and polyproline helix) proline also undergoes post-translational modifications such as hydroxylation followed sometimes by glycosylation. Glycosylation of hydroxyproline (Hyp) is widespread in the plant kingdom and occurs in Hyp-rich glycoprotein/peptides (HRGPs) that are associated with the cell walls of algae and flowering plants. However, the structural, conformational and biological implications of Hyp-glycosylation have not been addressed. This discovery grant explores the structure-function relationships of glycosylated Hyp-peptides in model peptides. In the short-term we will develop synthetic methodologies to prepare suitably protected glycosyl hydroxyproline building blocks that will be incorporated into peptides by solid-phase synthesis. In the longer-term, we will probe the structural, conformational, kinetic and physical properties of Hyp-glycosylation in plant-derived HRGPs as well as artificial Hyp-glycosylation of human-derived Hyp-rich peptides by nuclear magnetic resonance, circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry.  The outcome of our research will provide for the first time insight into the structural, conformational, physical and biological implications of post-translational Hyp glycosylation in proteins and peptides and will impact many diverse research areas ranging from structural (glyco)biology to materials science.

"Micrometer size photonic circuits composed of waveguides, resonators, semiconductor amplifiers, multiplexers, etc., is the fundamental constituent of the devices used in modern communication, instrumentation and medicine. My work relates to the exploitation of a subset of these circuits whose main component is the ring or disk resonator, fabricated by monolithic surface wave or by buried hetero-structure technology. In contrast to standing wave (axial mode) Fabry-P�rot resonators supporting counterpropagating waves, microrings and microdisks are unidirectional traveling wave devices, where simultaneous propagation in opposite directions occurs only if deliberately launched or created by an embedded discontinuity. This property gives rise to their unique features in add/drop filter and multiplexer applications.



Within the framework of this grant application I shall complete the second and final phase of my work on the design of multiring optical multiplexers with extended free spectral range (FSR), with special emphasis on limitations imposed by waveguide, scattering and radiation loss. I shall also continue my work on composite reflectors built with coupled microrings to investigate some of their characteristics that control their use as laser mirrors and in interferometers. Finally, I plan to continue my work analyzing the group delay and dispersion of multiring filter devices to contribute to the novel art of ""dispersion or phase engineering"".

"My research focuses on understanding and predicting the properties of strongly-interacting matter in the laboratory and the cosmos based on strong interactions between neutrons and protons. The physics of strong interactions spans from new structures in neutron-rich nuclei, universal properties in ultracold atoms and low-density neutron matter, to the extremes reached in supernovae and neutron stars. One of our highlights is the application of a powerful method, called the renormalizaton group, to nuclear interactions. This leads to universal low-momentum interactions that show great promise in few- and many-body calculations and set new frontiers with a unified description of light to heavy nuclei and matter in astrophysics. We will develop the renormalization group for three-nucleon interactions. The proposed research will test low-momentum interactions in nuclear systems on earth and in stars, using powerful many-body methods and developing new ones. My research is strongly connected to and exploits synergies with the experimental ISAC program. One milestone will be the very first calculation with microscopic three-nucleon interactions in medium-mass nuclei, and we will systematically investigate their impact on the evolution to neutron-rich nuclei and the location of the neutron drip line. Our nuclear matter results motivate a program to derive a universal nuclear energy density functional from low-momentum interactions, with first applications to superfluid gaps. We will apply the developments for neutron-rich nuclei and nuclear matter to astrophysics: to the nuclear equation of state for core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star structure/mergers; to light nuclei and neutrino interactions near the neutrinosphere (surface of last neutrino scattering); and to develop a unified approach and improved neutrino physics input for simulations. An important interdisciplinary part is my research on universal properties of Fermi gases with resonant interactions. This can be studied with ultracold atoms, and provides constraints and novel insights to nuclear systems. We will explore the properties of strongly-interacting spin-polarized Fermi gases and novel three-body physics in three-spin-state mixtures.

"Large igneous provinces (LIPs) consist of enormous emplacements of mafic extrusive and intrusive rocks, and they include such prominent features on Earth as continental flood basalts, oceanic plateaus, volcanic passive margins, submarine ridges, seamount chains, and perhaps some of the world's largest layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions. The major goals of the proposed field-petrologic-geochemical-isotopic-geochronologic research program address (1) how LIPs are initiated and how they are assembled, (2) how magmatism related to LIPs wanes and over what timeframe, and (3) whether two giant layered intrusions (Bushveld, Stillwater) represent the high-level cumulate reservoirs of LIPs? To address how LIPs are ""born"", the physical, chemical, and temporal architecture of the Triassic Karmusten flood basalts on Vancouver Island will be established to evaluate the mechanisms for assembly and growth of this immense accreted oceanic plateau. To address how LIPs ""die"", post-flood basalt intrusions from the Kerguelen Archipelago, a major oceanic island in the southern Indian Ocean, will be studied to determine what controls the origin and distribution of secondary magmatism, which occurs millions of years after the main magmatic activity ceases, in some LIPs. Given the very large volumes of basaltic magma produced over relatively short periods of geologic time, LIP magmatism represents a remarkably efficient process for the formation of basalt on Earth. The research program on these major large igneous provinces and layered intrusions will yield new samples, geochemical and geochronologic results, and interpretations that will significantly advance our knowledge of the internal evolution of these giant igneous bodies and the rates by which they form. The program will contribute directly to the training of 3 graduate and 3-4 undergraduate students, who will each be exposed to a wide range of research management, data analysis, and presentation skills that are in high demand from the mineral exploration industry, geological surveys, and research institutions worldwide.","Advancement of knowledge","University of British Columbia",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","P�trologie, g�ologie ign�e et m�tamorphique","Sciences de la terre"

"This research is concerned with actuarial modelling incorporating Bayesian methods. The results it produces will find application in the determination of appropriate and fair insurance premiums and adequately funded public and private pension plans. These subjects are of concern to most members of our society and are of tremendous importance to the average Canadian. Actuarial practitioners (or actuaries) study issues like these and develop models and solutions for financial and societal problems involving uncertain future events. These models often include a statistical component, since the study of future events almost always includes some aspect of randomness. 



A Bayesian statistical method treats all unknowns appearing in a model as random quantities and derives their distribution given the known information. Bayesian methods have a long history of successful application in actuarial science and have many desirable properties. For example, they allow past experience or prior evidence to be incorporated into a model and yield results that are easily understood. 



In recent years there have been many developments in Bayesian statistics that have yet to find application in the actuarial field. Actuaries design and guarantee the soundness of many of our financial security systems, and must have access to the latest statistical methods in their work. Through my research program I aim to design new, and refine some existing, Bayesian methods for use in specialised actuarial contexts like loss modelling, loss reserving, and salary function estimation. Improved methods for loss reserving, for example, would allow insurance companies to better forecast future claims, and health care authorities to better estimate certain future medical benefit costs, thus benefiting the average Canadian.

"Although travel behavior research in general has advanced considerably over the past decade, spearheaded by new data collection technologies and new modeling methods, one area that has seen less work is that pertaining to route choice. In part, this stems from a lack of data pertaining to observed routes - data that can now be collected via GPS technology. At the same time, in an era characterized by rising oil prices, energy conservation, traffic congestion, aging populations and climate change, there is a growing need to improve our understanding of the spatial manifestation of activity/travel behavior - that is, navigating urban transportation networks. Since travel demand forecasting is done using some form of traffic assignment algorithm, the research proposed can reveal whether the assumptions underlying such algorithms are valid. If not, then one must question the validity of predictions from such models - predictions that are used to guide development in urban areas. In other words, how can a transportation planner enhance quality of life when the model outputs are simply inaccurate?

   The goal of the proposed research is to understand and model route choice decisions. To this end, a comprehensive GPS-enhanced data set collected in 2007-08 for a sample of households in the Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada is used to address the following objectives: (1) to compare alternative methods for generating route choice sets; (2) to compare route choice models using alternative modeling structures that have been proposed to capture similarities between routes; (3) to examine the effect of choice set reduction on model estimates; (4) to determine if route choice behavior varies between groups of individuals based on their socio-demographic characteristics; (5) to determine if route choice behavior varies by trip purpose; and (6) to determine if route choice behavior varies by time of day.","Transportation systems and services","McMaster University",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","G�nie du transport","G�nie civil"

"The Mohawk Applied Research Centre in Health Informatics (MARC-HI) at Mohawk College in Hamilton,

Ontario, in collaboration with various industry partners, is proposing to create a working example of the

national Electronic Health Records Solution (EHRS). Ultimately, the EHRS will connect 40,000 health care

support systems Canada-wide to provide health professionals with centralized access to a patient's complete

medical history to assist diagnosis and ensure safe and effective treatment. Using the Canadian standard, the

goal of the five year MARC-HI project is to create and demonstrate a model of the solution. In addition, the

project team, which includes college faculty, staff, students, graduates, as well as vendor partners, will build

and demonstrate options that can be used to simplify and standardize connections to the system by doctors'

offices, hospital, laboratories, pharmacies, and other points of health care services. Participants in this project

will gain valuable experience and training in specialized technology, which in turn, will have a significant

impact locally, regionally, and nationally. In addition, Mohawk College plans to create a new specialization in

its Software Development diploma program, and will develop new training that will help to relieve the severe

shortage of Health Informatics professionals in Canada. We will share research findings through

demonstrations at local and national conferences, as well as publications in journals. Transfer of knowledge

and technology will also be accomplished with the release of publicly available software, potentially benefiting

hundreds of computer specialists working to modernize Canada's health care system.","Not available","Mohawk College of Applied Arts & Technology","1 & 2","CCIP  ","College and Community Innovation Program","Non disponible","Non disponible"
"Physical Cosmology can be split into 2 major branches: the detailed study of how structure formed; and the determination of the parameters which describe the entire Universe. My research involves both facets.

We are in a period of rapid growth in our understanding of cosmology. Many of today's questions appear imminently answerable - and this is what makes cosmology currently so exciting!

We know that the Universe has close to flat geometry, and is dominated by a mysterious dark energy, with most of the matter also made of some as yet unknown form. The early Universe was very smooth, with low amplitude density perturbations of the sort generated by inflation, which grew through gravitational instability to make all of today's structure. Galaxies are the fundamental building blocks of this structure, but the details of galaxy formation are not yet understood, because it involves a huge range of physical processes and scales.

The determination of the cosmological parameters suggested a set of ""why?"" questions:  where did the parameters come from?, did inflation really happen?, etc. But these cannot be answered without resolving the ""how?"" questions of structure formation: when did the first stars form? what is the history of star-formation over cosmic time? how are supermassive black holes related to their host galaxies? what will be the far future fate of the Universe and of our small part of it?

Hence the study of the two main branches of cosmology are always intimately connected.

Tackling the biggest questions in the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies requires a combination of observational and theoretical approaches, covering the full electromagnetic spectrum. A crucial and developing window lies at sub-millimetre wavelengths, where one can readily study high redshift star-forming galaxies. Deep extragalactic surveys using new sub-millimetre instruments can unveil the early history of star formation, particularly by adapting data analysis and statistical tools developed for studying the Cosmic Microwave Background.","Advancement of knowledge","University of British Columbia",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Astronomie et astrophysique","Astronomie et astrophysique"

"A fundamental question in heart biology is how this organ develops and assumes its mature, adult form. The heart must continue to maintain blood flow in the developing embryo while still growing and undergoing concerted cell movements that convert a linear heart tube into a complex structure. Due to its optical clarity, rapid external development, and amenability to genetic approaches, the zebrafish has become a powerful tool to study how genes regulate heart development. In a large-scale screen for genes that play important roles in heart development I have identified a mutation that affects how the endocardium (inner lining of the heart) and myocardium (muscular layer of the heart) communicate to ensure that the heart assumes proper shape and function.  This mutation blocks production of a protein called Ccdc80. Of great interest is the fact that Ccdc80 is a novel, potentially secreted, protein of unknown function. 



The experiments outlined in this proposal aim to discover how Ccdc80 functions to regulate heart development. Specifically, we will determine what goes wrong in hearts depleted of Ccdc80. Detailed studies of heart cell shape and gene expression patterns will be undertaken. Next, we will establish where Ccdc80 is required in the developing heart, and how its signal is mediated. Finally, we will discover how the Ccdc80 signal acts by defining which genes it regulates during heart development.



Heart development can be visualized in real-time in the zebrafish embryo. We will therefore be able to examine aspects of heart development that can only be visualized in a static fashion in other model systems such as the mouse. This work will not only inform as to how Ccdc80 functions, but also provide insight into the mechanisms that promote the proper development of the embryonic heart.

"Simon Fraser University has made an enormous investment in research and training in infectious diseases and immunology.  It supported a Canada Research Chair in Molecular Immunity for my research in HIV and vaccines, as well as infrastructure funding from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, which was used to acquire a BD FACSAria instrument.  Since 2004, SFU has also hired 6 new faculty members, has built a new animal care facility, and is building a new CL3 facility to support infectious diease and immunology research, and is launching a highly interdisciplinary graduate program in this area.

    )	The BD FACSAria is a state-of-the-art instrument that can analyze markers on the surface of live, single cells, and it can sort live cells into separate pools, based on differences in their surface features.  This allows one to study the functions of living cells based on their surface features. Several labs in the infectious disease and immunology group at SFU are interested in studying cells of the immune system that are, or may be, infected with pathogenic organisms.  Infected cells present a risk of infecting the researchers studying them, and in separating cells, the FACSAria creates an aerosol, which is mostly contained by a vacuum system; however, there is the chance of aerosol escaping and contaminating the air in the laboratory.  Because of this, we are currently unable to study cells that are or may be infected with pathogens. The FACSAria could be moved to the new CL3 laboratory once it's built; but access to the FACSAria, the only flow cytometer and/or cell sorter on campus, would become highly restricted. While another flow cytometer will be purchased by our new faculty, there are no plans to acquire another cell sorter. We propose to solve this problem by housing the FACSAria in a biocontainment cabinet that would remove the aerosol during cell separation experiments. This would allow the FACSAria to stay its existing, new, facility without limiting its accessibility; importantly, it would allow the analysis and sorting of potentially infected cells under conditions that are at least as safe as being in the open in a CL3 facility.

"My long-term research objective is to identify factors that affect host-parasite population dynamics in order to anticipate the consequences of control interventions.   One of the challenges of understanding how parasitic organisms affect their host population is that research is done either in the field (where many factors influence the results) or in tightly controlled laboratory experiments (where conditions are far from those of the real world).  To overcome this, I use 2 experimental systems where the parasite and host interact together in a semi-natural setting:  (1) an ectoparasite that lives on the skin and fin of guppies and spreads through the population when fish come in contact with each other, and (2) a nematode parasite that lives in the intestine of mice and releases eggs in the faeces that hatch into larval stages that are then ingested by other mice in the population.  This proposal addresses 3 questions.  (1) We will compare the pattern of epidemic spread of the ectoparasite through guppy populations that are living in different concentrations of waterborne zinc.  Zinc is a common pollutant, especially around aquaculture sites, and our results will indicate whether the presence of zinc is likely to increase the frequency of disease outbreaks.  (2) Our second set of experiments will be used to explain why strains of mice that are genetically susceptible to the nematode parasite become more resistant to infection if the transmission rates are low, but that the genetically resistant mice don't become more resistant.  In animal and human populations, control programs attempt to reduce rates of transmission, and design of these programs will benefit if we better understand the link between transmission rate and resistance to infection.  (3) Finally, we will attempt to understand which biological processes take precedence when mice have limited energetic resources.  We will measure how well mice grow, reproduce and maintain a functional immune response when they are malnourished and also infected with a nematode parasite.  With ever expanding human activities, wild animals are increasingly stressed.  Our work to understand how they handle competing demands may guide biologists as they try to better manage wild animal populations.

"Nanoparticles have been used in heterogeneous catalysis in the petrochemical industry for selective hydrogenation and oxidation reactions for many years, and it has long been realized that metallic nanoparticles can used to improve the sensitivity and selectivity of solid-state gas sensors. My long-term research objective is to develop highly selective and ultra-sensitive nanoparticle catalysts and sensors through the control of the size, shape, structure, and composition of nanoparticles, and precisely controlling the nanostructural and microstructural ordering of the nanoparticles within high-surface area solid-state supports. This work will be important for the development of highly efficient industrial catalysts which give minimal undesired products, as well as solid-state sensors which can detect trace amounts of toxic gases in the atmosphere.

My first major goal is to investigate the solution phase catalytic activity of gold and bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts. A particular challenge is finding systems in which the nanoparticles are stabilized and not passivated in solution; directions include the use of polymers and block-copolymers as stabilizing ligands, selective oxidation of ligands on nanoparticle surfaces, as well as working in unique media such as ionic liquids. We also wish to determine how the structure and composition of nanoparticles can be tuned towards controlling catalytic processes over their surfaces.

A second major goal in this work is to develop heterogeneous catalysts and solid-state gas sensors from well-defined pre-synthesized nanoparticles. This system involves trapping nanoparticles into sol-gel matrices of oxide supports, followed by removal of organic stabilizers via calcinations or plasma treatment. These studies provide an alternative method of designing industrially-relevant, supported-nanoparticle catalysts.

Canada needs to develop nanotechnology platforms in order to compete in the global marketplace, and I believe the nanocatalyst and nanosensor projects described here are an extremely important step in doing so.

"Though computers proliferate in modern work environments, it is still commonplace for people to print off reports, charts, and other data to facilitate discussions and decision-making in face-to-face meetings.  In time- or life-critical situations, such as crisis response and security and defence, decisions must often be made based on rapidly changing information.  In these settings, decision-makers need direct access to current information and must be able to share this information with nearby colleagues.  Recent developments in interactive, large-screen displays, such as Microsoft's interactive tabletop display, called Surface, now enable people to interact with and share up-to-date digital information, such as maps, documents, and sensor data, during collaborative activities.  However, designing effective interfaces for these display systems is challenging due to their large size, shared input space, and, in the case of a tabletop system, horizontal display orientation.  The requested equipment will be used to support a research program that addresses the lack of suitable interfaces and associated software applications for these systems.  This research program will contribute improved software user interfaces for interactive, multi-user display systems.  It will also improve our understanding of how interactive wall and tabletop systems can be effectively utilized in the context of complex, time-critical task domains, such as military command and control, and emergency response.  Through this research, students will be trained in collaborative technology design and empirical research methods. These skills are critical for developing information technologies for highly collaborative work environments, such as defence, healthcare, education, and software and game development.

"This research aims to solve the mystery of how base and precious metal ore bodies are formed in volcanic rocks. Some of these deposits contain in excess of 100 million tonnes of ore. These are rare but very desirable because they represent the most cost effective means of producing metals such as zinc, copper, lead, silver and gold that are essential to modern society. Canadian examples such as Kidd Creek in Ontario and Brunswick #12 in New Brunswick would completely fill 10 Toronto Rogers Centres. Another aspect of my research is to determine the dispersal patterns of contaminants in sediments resulting from the ore-forming process. These contaminants (various metals, barium and arsenic) may provide vectors towards ores. 

   It is generally considered that ore bodies now on land formed in ancient seas where seawater circulating through hot volcanic rocks became heated to 350�C (hot enough to melt lead). This hot sea water leached metals from the rocks and precipitated them as minerals where it discharged onto the sea floor. These metal-rich hot springs, known as ""black smokers"" because they resemble a dirty industrial process, are found in many regions of the world's oceans but none of them are accumulating metals in anywhere near the amounts of a Kidd Creek. From where, then, did all the metals in Kidd Creek come? The answer may be from fluids and gases, a so-called ""magmatic fluid"", issuing directly from the molten rock (""magma"") that produces lavas from the depths of the Earth. Careful work on volcanic rocks from the sea bed off eastern Papua New Guinea with high resolution microscopes and micro analytical instruments has shown that accidentally trapped magmatic fluids are extremely rich in metals, many times more that the hot sea water of the black smokers. The trick to produce a giant ore body may be for this magmatic fluid to mix with the normal black smoker fluids and thereby transport much larger quantities of metals.

"Obligate brood parasites lay their eggs in nests of other species of birds, thus depending on the hosts to rear their offspring. As most hosts produce fewer young, adaptations for successful parasitism are countered by increasingly sophisticated adaptations by hosts that minimize the effects of parasitism or the likelihood that it will occur. Focusing primarily on parasitic cowbirds in North America, with comparative work on cuckoos in the old world, we are studying this interaction from the standpoints of parasite and host. Once believed to parasitize any nests they happened upon, cowbirds are now known to use some hosts more than others; this is not surprising because cowbirds lay fewer eggs than previously believed. They seem to select only certain hosts, perhaps the best ones. Studying cowbirds and hosts in different habitats, we are exploring the idea that selective host use increases a cowbird's reproductive success. With experiments, we are identifying attributes of hosts that may cause cowbirds to lay non-randomly: (1) nest defense and acquisition of requisite behaviour, (2) nest placement, (3) tolerance of parasitism, and (4) host quality. We are comparing differences within and among species that influence host use, such as size, aggressiveness at nests, parasitism of already-parasitized nests (and its conservation implications), egg-discrimination capabilities, and costs of acceptance versus rejection of cowbird eggs. We will focus mainly on host tolerance and host quality, building in part on our discovery 15 years ago of a small species that ejects cowbird eggs. Experiments will extend work on limits of how hosts see cowbird eggs and their own eggs relative to their abilities to recognize foreign eggs, and on bill-size constraints, answering the pervasive question of why so many host species tolerate costly parasitism. Knowing the minimum physical requirements for ejection and host-specific costs of acceptance is essential for understanding whether equilibrium or lag better explains acceptance in each host species. Rejection costs may explain acceptance in some hosts (equilibrium), whereas lag explains it in hosts that cannot recognize cowbird eggs.

"An understanding of the interplay between massive star formation and the properties of the interstellar gas which control it is crucial to comprehending the evolution of the universe. An element of the research plan is to investigate this interaction by observations of nearby galaxies in the millimetre lines of molecules which are tracers of conditions in the interstellar gas. In addition, theoretical computations are being undertaken to simulate the excitation effects of the shock waves produced by the formation of massive stars on the surrounding medium. In this way, it is intended to separate initial gas conditions from those that are the consequences of star formation, especially in galaxies undergoing bursts of massive star formation.

   In addition, some new ideas will be tested concerning the collective effects on the interstellar gas of the winds of newly born massive stars in large star clusters which are known to be a primary route of star formation in starburst galaxies. In particular, the nature of the numerous compact sources of radio radiation in such galaxies will be the focus of these ideas, since they are currently thought to be the remnants of supernovae, the explosions which end the life of massive stars. If borne out, these ideas will show that they are instead the collective effects of cluster winds, which in turn may considerably modify our understanding of the impact of massive star formation on the surrounding gas. 

   Finally, we will conduct a molecular line study of the star forming potential of gas at the very centre of our own Galaxy in order to understand how this process occurs despite the inhibiting effects of intense ultraviolet 

radiation and gravitational tidal stresses associated with the central region. Emphasis is being placed on certain molecular tracers which will sample the dissociation and evaporation of molecular gas from potential star forming clumps, and reveal the evaporation of the mantles of interstellar dust grains. The study will have relevance to the formation of galaxies and quasars at an early stage of the universe.

"Corporations are under growing pressure to consider the economic, environmental, and social implications of their activities. In response, commitments to apply the principles of sustainable development are increasingly being made at the corporate level. To measure progress towards these commitments, stakeholders require synthesized information regarding a corporation's sustainable development performance. However, many corporations and external organizations have struggled to develop robust measures of performance.

     The purpose of this research program is to develop methodological foundations for the creation of robust measures of corporate sustainable development performance. The short-term research objectives focus on two key areas. First, current perspectives on the measurement of performance at the company-, sector-, and market-levels will be explored. Second, methodologies for the development of robust corporate sustainable development performance measures at those three levels will be created. The long-term research objectives focus on applying the methodologies in order to establish their utility.

     A mixed methods approach will be employed to achieve the purpose and objectives. Data will be collected through a combination of surveys, interviews, focus groups, and case studies. Quantitative data will be analyzed using statistical techniques, while themes will be developed from the qualitative data using text analysis through a coding process. Several operations research techniques, including multivariate analysis, geometric aggregation, and sensitivity and uncertainty analysis will be employed in the development of the measures. Six graduate and five undergraduate students will be trained over the course of the research program.

     Achieving the research objectives will address key gaps in the existing research. It will provide needed insight into the design, implementation, use, and evolution of corporate sustainable development performance measures. This will inform the development of innovative methodologies to support their creation.

"As adults, skilled readers seldom experience difficulty identifying individual words. But the ease and speed with which words are identified is misleading. Word identification is the culmination of a sequence of sophisticated information processing operations, and for language researchers these processes have been the focus of many of their investigations. As a result of these investigations, a number of theories and models of how people identify words have been developed, each embodying certain assumptions about the nature of the processing underlying the rapid identification of words. In all of the models, the speed with which a word is identified is influenced by the reader's knowledge of other, orthographically similar words (the word's ""neighbors""). According to the models, when a word is presented, the mental representation of the word and the mental representations of the word's neighbors are activated. A further assumption of some models is that there is competition among these representations and this competition plays a central role in the word identification process. My research will test these assumptions by examining how the identification of a word is affected by its neighbours: if there is competition between a word and its neighbours when the word is read then this will affect the time required to identify the word. My research will use experimental techniques that have seldom been used by other investigators to test these assumptions, including the use of eye movement monitoring equipment to track readers' eyes while they read sentences. This research is important because the identification of words is the foundation of skilled reading, and before there can be any understanding of how we read there must first be an understanding of the processes responsible for the rapid identification of individual words.",Psychology,"University of Calgary",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Science cognitive -- langage",Psychologie
"The telecommunications sector has been one of the fastest growing sectors in the past decade. This trend has been fueled by an unprecedented growth in the number of new applications in wireless communications and the expansion of existing ones. With rapid growth, managing the capacity and quality of the wireless air interface becomes a challenge. Ultra-wideband (UWB) radio is emerging as an innovative solution for the increase demand for short-range low cost reduced-power wireless devices with video transfer capability within home and office environments. The primary objective of the proposed research program is to address the above requirements and playing a leading role in the development of innovative solutions with focus on two innovations. First, to study, design and implement novel UWB low profile antennas that satisfy UWB technology requirement. Research in this area will focus on theoretical and experimental studies to overcome many challenges for discovering new design rules, new innovative antennas, and new application areas. To meet wireless industry requirements for small size antennas in handheld devices, our efforts also include miniaturization process that compromises between the size and performance of the antenna. Second, we investigate the basis for the design of new Electromagnetic Band Pass (EBP) dielectric waveguide-based antennas and microwave devices. EBP periodic structures allow energy to propagate with certain properties to form low cost, high performance and fully integrated circuits, antennas, and systems for emerging wireless telecommunications and microwave imaging applications. We will investigate EBP pass band characteristics as opposed to their stop band or band gap characteristics and develop EBP-based novel devices for a broad range of emerging applications. Trainees involved in this program will gain advanced knowledge area expertise and technical competency in wireless systems related areas. The developed technologies integrated with intelligent networks have the potential to offer businesses and consumers greater control over communications environment resulting in increasing productivity and improving the efficiency and quality of services.

"The proposed research is a multi-pronged experimental investigation aimed at understanding the composition, state and core dynamics of Earth, Mercury, Mars and Jupiter's satellites Io and Ganymede. The central parts of these planetary bodies are composed primarily of iron and its dilute alloys of sulfur and silicon. The physical properties of these liquid iron alloys control fundamental processes such as heat flow from the core to the mantle as well as the generation and maintenance of magnetic fields inside their cores. The guiding principle of our approach is that understanding the macro-scale processes that govern global geodynamics pivots on our knowledge of the micro-scale aspects of the mineral physics and chemistry of planetary materials that control them. The research will involve experimental measurements of the electrical resistivity, density and viscosity of liquid iron-sulfur-silicon alloys and analog materials at extreme pressures (20GPa) and temperatures (2500K) in large volume presses to simulate the conditions deep inside these planetary bodies. Additional studies of partitioning of U and Si isotopes between liquid metal and silicate will be carried out. With a planned team of 10 HQP over the period of the proposal, we will employ novel techniques developed in our lab to measure density and viscoity using composite spheres in the sink/float method. Synchrotron x-ray radiography will provide real-time  images of the sphere motion in the pressurized liquid. The significance of the results is expected in three areas of deep Earth and planetary studies. 1. The results will help to determine the core compositions of these bodies.  2. The measured physical properties are required for accurate models of the dynamics (geodynamo and heat flow) of the cores of these planetary bodies. 3. The results will directly address the basic physics of constant physical property behavior along the pressure-dependent melting boundary. 



The proposed studies will help to determine what these planetary bodies are made of and how they work.

"Since its birth a few decades ago, mathematical finance has matured into a discipline that has managed to express in rigorous mathematical form many of the issues of current relevance in the financial sector. One of those issues, which is of growing relevance is that of dependence. In its simplest form, correlation between prices has always been known to be a key fact in many theories, from Markowitz portfolio optimization to some of the more complex credit-sensitive derivative instruments. But whereas other parameters, such as volatility, have been analyzed in detail and theories created to model them, correlation continues to be dealt with in a rather simplistic form. Yet, with many non-gaussian theories being created in recent times, a need for 

a richer dependence structure, correlation-based or otherwise, will soon become the main obstacle for further theoretical developments with practical impact. 

The research proposed builds on past research in general aspects of financial mathematics and financial risk management, and has a medium term objective to focus on models that allow for random dependence structures, with an ultimate goal to be able to successfully model observed phenomena in financial markets and associated portfolios.","Commercial services","University of Toronto",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Mod�lisation math�matique","Math�matiques appliqu�es"
"Aggressive technology scaling has been the mainstay of digital CMOS circuit design for the past 30 years. It has resulted in the design of multi-gigahertz integrated circuit (IC) and unprecedented levels of integration. Modern integrated circuits operate at clock frequencies of more than 3 GHz, and their dies contain close to 300 million transistors. Digital IC performance has followed Moore's law, improving annually by 30%. However, ATE performance has improved by only 12% annually. The discrepancy between ATE edge placement accuracy and circuit under test (CUT) performance1 will make at-speed logic testing increasingly difficult for future deep-submicron technologies (DSM).



Most of today's advanced delay faults algorithms are able to propagate those delay faults which are creating logic or glitch faults, but we propose an approaches for gate-delay fault diagnosis in deep sub-micron by a series of injections and evaluations to propagate the actual timing faults as well as those delay faults that eventually creating logic faults to the primary outputs. Unlike the backtrack algorithm that predicts the fault site by tracing the syndrome at a faulty output back into the circuit, this approach propagate the fault from fault site by mapping a nine-valued voltage model on top of a five-valued voltage model. In such a forward approach, the accuracy is much higher because all the composite syndromes at all faulty outputs are considered simultaneously. As a result, the proposed approach is robust and applicable even when the delay size is relatively small. Experimental results show that the number of fault candidates produced by this approach is considerable.

"The field of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) is concerned with the inspection of materials   (without harming them),in order to keep the structures we live in, the machinery we work with, the vehicles we ride in safe and reliable. Ultrasound, used in medicine, is also used to conduct NDE inspections and to locate and identify dangerous flaws such as cracks in materials. Such ultrasonic inspections, however, involve a very complex combination of electrical and acoustic/elastic components. Modeling of these components is the focus of this research program. Specifically, we will develop computer-based models of ultrasonic NDE systems that use phased array transducers and mode-converted ultrasonic waves. Phased array transducers allow one to scan a component electronically making inspections cheaper and faster.They also allow us to generate and receive waves of different types, including  mode-converted waves that are not observable by conventional transducers. Having the ability to model such multi-modal responses using phased arrays will allow us to develop significantly improved ultrasonic inspection systems. The direct beneficiaries will be the engineers who perform inspections on major structures such as aircraft, pipelines, bridges and nuclear reactors. The general public will also benefit by those engineers having the advanced methods developed here to keep those structures safe and reliable.

"Fuel prices and government regulations across the world are driving researchers to investigate new technologies for improving fuel economy and reducing emissions. 

One such technology is electronically controlled valve timing. It promises to achieve 10% in fuel savings compared to baseline engines.  This is accomplished mainly by reducing pumping losses, introducing cylinder deactivation and ensuring optimal valve timing even in transient engine operations.  These strategies have been known for many years, but building an electronic valve actuation device has been a considerable challenge.  Traditional electric or hydraulic servo systems are very slow. A new type of actuator is required, where a mechanical spring assembly provides the necessary acceleration and electromagnetic components determine timing. Much progress has been made in this area over the last 20 years, but no design has met the stringent criteria of performance, reliability, and acoustics that are necessary for automotive applications.

The proposed study addresses these challenges through a truly mechatronic approach.  The applicant will be optimizing mechanical, electrical, and magnetic components of several potential designs in order to arrive at an optimum device.

The findings of this study will help Canadian automakers to play a more dominant role in the development of internal combustion engine technologies.  Since electronic variable valve timing can also improve the efficiency of hybrid technologies, a window of opportunity is currently opening that could allow Canadian automakers to supply Canadian designed drivetrain components to the worlds leading automakers.

"Despite significant advances in knowledge about starch biosynthesis and structure, questions related to the initiation of crystal formation in the amyloplast and the specific architecture of the starch granule from different botanical sources, still persist. The goal of our research is to understand the architecture of starch granules and relate the knowledge gained to the behaviour of starch in multi-component food matrices. We propose to investigate starch granule architecture using iodine as a marker on native, granular dry starch, a novel technique we developed recently. Using iodine as a tool, we demonstrated mobility in native granular starches of linear polymers with degree of polymerization (dp) of up to 35 at moisture contents as low as 8% and up to dp 105 at a moisture content of 20 %. We further showed that starches from different botanical sources had significantly different iodine binding properties at moisture contents below 20%. These observations suggest that in native granules, there are stearically unrestricted segments of linear polymers that are free to move and form a single helical complex with iodine, exhibiting characteristic color at low moisture contents. By combining the iodine complexing technique with other controlled enzymatic and chemical modifications to the starch, we propose to further deduce the granular architecture of starches from different botanical sources. The proposed research will improve our understanding on one of the most prevalent polymers in nature. Moreover, this research has relevance in the application and uses of starches in foods. Research from our laboratory has shown that under limited moisture conditions, depending on the processing conditions, there is kinetic limitation that governs starch granule swelling, gelatinization and polymer rearrangement. Understanding granule architecture will aid in better understanding how polymers within granules disperse, phase-separate and form subsequent complexes upon cooling and storage. Preliminary data from our laboratory have shown that modulating the processing conditions can influence the subsequent network formed in the product and we can alter the rate of breakdown of starch into glucose during digestion, i.e., alter the glycemic response.

"The underlying theme of my research program is that biomaterials and the devices based on these materials (e.g., tissue-engineered constructs) are agonists of a biological response. Over the years this theme has manifested itself primarily in the problem of blood compatibility of cardiovascular biomaterials and in the microencapsulation of mammalian cells for the purpose of cell transplantation. Now our efforts are directed towards (1) vascularisation of tissue engineering constructs to circumvent the size limits imposed by Fick's law of diffusion and (2) understanding and controlling the host response to biomaterials. Much of the effort is centered on modular tissue engineering, a novel approach to tissue engineering that results in uniform, scaleable and vascularised constructs. It is based on small (currently cylindrical) modules made from collagen gel or a collagen-poloxamine interpenetrating network, containing embedded cells (e.g., liver cells or pancreatic islets). The modules are then covered with endothelial cells. When filling a space (e.g., a tube or a tissue cavity, in vivo) a packed bed bioreactor is created, in which the endothelial cells enable blood (and hence nutrients) to be perfused. We are currently (i) exploiting the utility of this approach to create fat tissue for post-cancer reconstruction or uniformly contracting sheets of heart muscle cells for the treatment of heart failure or to augment the engraftment of transplanted pancreatic islets and (ii) understanding and controlling the remodelling that occurs when endothelialized modules are implanted in a tissue cavity and subject to the host response The proposed efforts are directed to several of the challenges associated with advancing this concept: for example, (a) further delineation and validation of the design rules (involving Ergun equation; Thiele modulus and Biot number) that underpin the scaleability of the modular approach and (b) evaluation of the phenotype of the endothelial cells in the complex flow arrangements implicit to a packed bed.

"Problems of heat transfer in molecules are central in many parts of physical sciences and nanotechnology. Guiding energy flow in molecules is the key element in controlling chemical and biological processes, for example, reaction pathways and molecular dynamics. In molecular electronics, where molecules are the active components in nanoscale electronic circuits, local heating may cause structural instabilities undermining the device integrity. Engineering good thermal contacts and cooling the nanosystems are necessary for a stable operation mode. Minimization of mechanical devices, e.g. refrigerators and pumps, to the molecular scale is a topic of great interest for technologies such as chemical sensing, power generation and energy conversion.



The objective of this proposal is to theoretically study the mechanisms of heat conduction in molecular structures, with the ultimate goal of developing nanolevel analogs of large-scale thermal machines, for example, heat engines and refrigerators. Downscaling of electrical and mechanical devices has important implications on operation. While the operation principles of today's micro-scale devices are based on a classical physical picture, at the nanoscale, quantum effects must be considered, leading to distinct operation principles. We will formulate a fundamental framework of heat flow at the nanoscale, and study the role of quantum effects on the thermal properties of molecules. Based on the theoretical understanding, unique molecular-level non-classical mechanical devices will be developed.



The proposed research lies at the interface between theoretical chemistry, condensed matter physics, and device engineering disciplines. Merging concepts of these fields will lead to innovative and interdisciplinary studies, with benefits both in theoretical-computational chemistry, and for the development of nanoscience research in Canada.

"The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of the brain is central to the integration of attentional, affective, and visceral information and plays a central role in several key functions, including social self-regulation and self-monitoring of one's performance on tasks.  The single strongest electrophysiological reflection of ACC activation is an EEG response called the error-related negativity (ERN). The ERN is a distinctive EEG signal that is associated with a person realizing that they are about to make an error (such as pressing the wrong button), and it has become a very popular measure because of its association with the ACC and because it is relatively easy to obtain.  One of the interesting aspects of the ERN is that it has been related to specific personality traits associated with performance monitoring, such as obsessive-compulsiveness and high levels of socialization which have been related to larger ERNs, and such as risk-taking and sensation-seeking which have been associated with smaller ERNs.  It is also attenuated by alcohol consumption and negative affect but increased when the value of accuracy increases by giving more points for successful performance. It has even been related to political orientation, perhaps through the trait of being sensitive to errors or to informational conflict.  The proposed research is designed to examine why it is that people differ on the size of the ERN they produce, what the underlying reasons are for the ERN to be related to personality traits, and to understand the functions of the ACC better through understanding these relations.  The research will make use of (1) some aspects of brainwave responses that reflect brain response inconsistency and the interconnectedness of networks across the cortex, (2) the degree to which the person's conscious awareness of making incorrect versus correct responses accounts for ERN size and its relation to personality traits, (3) the contribution of genetics to the neurochemical basis for ACC responses, and (4) the importance of the dopamine reward system in regulating the responses of the ACC, and whether this is what links the ERN to personality traits.

"The research focuses on improving the waste disposal practice in Northern Regions of Canada.  In addition, ongoing research to improve our understanding of the frost heave process and water movement through the frozen fringe is planned.  Research is also proposed to develop an enhanced type of composite tailings (CT) to lower reclamation costs for the oil sands industry.

   The research on improving mine waste disposal will study how to place sulfide rich mine tailings in the Arctic to eliminate future concerns with Acid Mine Drainage.  Studies on the use of ""Freeze control"" placement of the tailings will be carried out.  ""Freeze control"" placement is a strategy of placing the mine waste in layers and allowing it to freeze during the winter.  Freezing locks the water into the ice and this has the potential to eliminate it from contact with the sulfide minerals.  Water and oxygen must be both present during the oxidation process to form acidic water known as acid mine drainage.   Once placement of the tailings are complete they will be covered with waste rock to minimize or eliminate thaw during the summer or as a result of climate induced warming.

   The applicant is applying for research funds to study development of a shale enhanced Consolidate/Composite Tailings (CT) that will allow for more rapid reclamation of the deposit and has the potential to sequester a substantial mass of salt in the final waste deposit.  The clay shale has the ability to absorb water and when it is mixed with mature fine tails from the oil sands mines it forms a low strength clay that has an extremely small ability to transmit water. These characteristics will be combined to form this enhanced CT.

   Research on the behavior of freezing soils will be undertaken to improve the professions understanding of the fundamentals of frost heave and the soil properties that control its magnitude.

A challenge faced in the design of these out-of-pit tailings ponds is the presence of regionally occurring buried sand channels that may act as preferential flow paths of PA water seepage. Preliminary modeling predicts the infiltration of PA seepage into the adjacent sand channels, however the extent of this impact is poorly understood.

Research is proposed to: 1) Improve the understanding of PA water transport through the local, natural sediments to better quantify the extent of impact, and 2) Remediate impacted soils, including the development of risk-based closure mechanisms. Specifically, this research will evaluate the potential of natural attenuation within the overlying till and the sand channel. Further, this research will evaluate the potential to reduce the impacts of PA tailings water on the sand channel by both intrinsic biodegradation and in-situ oxidation.

The proposed research will provide the ability to predict the fate and transport of chemicals of concern through clay-till, into and through a sand channel, promoting sound groundwater management and remediation as required in the oil sand mining industry.

"The research focuses on improving the waste disposal practice in Northern Regions of Canada.  In addition, ongoing research to improve our understanding of the frost heave process and water movement through the frozen fringe is planned.  Research is also proposed to develop an enhanced type of composite tailings (CT) to lower reclamation costs for the oil sands industry.

   The research on improving mine waste disposal will study how to place sulfide rich mine tailings in the Arctic to eliminate future concerns with Acid Mine Drainage.  Studies on the use of ""Freeze control"" placement of the tailings will be carried out.  ""Freeze control"" placement is a strategy of placing the mine waste in layers and allowing it to freeze during the winter.  Freezing locks the water into the ice and this has the potential to eliminate it from contact with the sulfide minerals.  Water and oxygen must be both present during the oxidation process to form acidic water known as acid mine drainage.   Once placement of the tailings are complete they will be covered with waste rock to minimize or eliminate thaw during the summer or as a result of climate induced warming.

   The applicant is applying for research funds to study development of a shale enhanced Consolidate/Composite Tailings (CT) that will allow for more rapid reclamation of the deposit and has the potential to sequester a substantial mass of salt in the final waste deposit.  The clay shale has the ability to absorb water and when it is mixed with mature fine tails from the oil sands mines it forms a low strength clay that has an extremely small ability to transmit water. These characteristics will be combined to form this enhanced CT.

   Research on the behavior of freezing soils will be undertaken to improve the professions understanding of the fundamentals of frost heave and the soil properties that control its magnitude.

"Intervertebral discs form the soft connective tissue joints of the spine required for spinal stabilization, load bearing, and movement. The central part of the disc, the nucleus pulposus, plays a key role in the physiological function of the intervertebral disc, however the developmental origin of its cells and the role of the notochord in its formation and maintenance are unknown. The loss of notochord cells from the intervertebral disc has been correlated with aging and degeneration, suggesting that the notochord plays an important role in this tissue. Cell-based strategies for intervertebral disc tissue engineering require a better understanding of the role of the notochord. The objective of these studies is to determine the role of notochord cells at specific stages of intervertebral disc development to determine if they act as stem cells in the nucleus pulposus. To trace notochord cells in the embryo and isolate them from distinct stages of spine development, we have generated a genetically engineered mouse in which notochord cells are marked by the expression of reporter genes.  These studies will give us a better understanding of intervertebral disc formation by establishing the developmental origin of the nucleus pulposus and by better describing the properties of notochord cells in the intervertebral disc.  Deciphering the factors that control intervertebral disc development may suggest strategies for the tissue engineering of these structures.

"Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] contains high concentrations of isoflavone and tocopherol, which both have putative health-beneficial properties. The North American market value for soybean isoflavones alone is of 500 million $. The proposed research program aims at providing an understanding of the factors affecting the concentrations of isoflavone and tocopherol in soybean. Using studies conducted in multiple environments we will identify among a wide range of environmental factors (i.e., air and soil temperature, soil moisture, fertility, etc...) those affecting the most soybean isoflavone and tocopherol concentrations. In controlled environments, we will also determine if particular growth stages are more responsive to specific environmental factors, focusing on the impact of air temperature and soil moisture, which were previously reported to significantly affect isoflavone and tocopherol concentrations in soybean. In these later studies we will look at the impact of several stress treatments on soybean isoflavone and tocopherol concentrations using HPLC, as well as gene expression. We will use real-time QRT-PCR technology to quantify transcript levels of genes involved in isoflavone synthesis [phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone reductase (CHR), isoflavone synthase (IFS), malonyl transferase (MT), and glucosyl transferase (GT)] and tocopherol synthesis [homogentisate phytyltransferase (HPT), 7,2-methyl-6-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinol methyltransferase (MPBQ MT), tocopherol cyclase (TC), and gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase (gamma-TMT)] in plant tissues at different stages of soybean growth development following treatments. In order to understand how stress affects soybean isoflavone and tocopherol concentrations, we will study their relation to genes expression. Ultimately, this research will contribute to the development of new value-added productions and create economic opportunities for Canadian agricultural producers and associated agri-industries.
